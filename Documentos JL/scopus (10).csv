Forward-thinking higher education institutions (HEIs) are adapting courses to equip students with the skills, knowledge and attitudes that are necessary to maximise the positive and far-reaching impact of engineering on society and the environment. But constraints exist that must be overcome if these improvements are to be scaled-up and sustained over time. Importantly, there is often a lack of knowledge of global issues amongst teaching staff and a resistance to what is seen by some as a dilution of core engineering content. This workshop will explore what is meant by the global dimension in engineering education. It will draw on the experience of an ongoing project entitled A Global Dimension for Engineering Education that is being implemented by Engineers Against Poverty in association with the Engineering Subject Centre, Engineering Council, Institute of Education and the Engineering Professors Council. The workshop will be highly interactive and participants will: • Become familiar with what is meant by the global dimension in engineering education • Consider barriers to incorporating the global dimension into engineering education and identify strategies for overcoming them • Discuss examples of good practice in incorporating the global dimension into engineering education.",,"Core engineering; Engineering professors; Global dimension; Global issues; Good practices; Higher education institutions; Teaching staff; Climate change; Engineering; Engineers; Students; Engineering education","Baillie, C., Feinblatt, E., (2010) Needs and Feasibility: A Guide for Student Development Projects, , Morgan and Claypool; Baillie, C., Catalano, G., (2009) Engineering and Society: Working Towards Social Justice, , Morgan and Claypool; Bourn, D., Neal, I., (2008) The Global Engineer: Incorporating Global Skills Within Higher Education of Engineers, , March 2008, Engineers Against Poverty and Institute of Education; Catalano, G., (2006) Engineering, Peace, Ethics and the Earth, , Morgan and Claypool; (2005) Developing the Global Dimension in the School Curriculum, , Department for International Development DFID, 2005; (2004) The Accreditation of Higher Education Programmes, , UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence; Franklin, U., (1990) The Real World of Technology, , Anansi","Matthews, P.; Engineers Against PovertyUnited Kingdom; email: p.matthews@engineersagainstpoverty.org",,,,"English","Eng.

The introduction of the Engineering Diploma in 2008 was anticipated with years of planning by Sheffield Childrens and Young Peoples Directorate (CYPD). The Post-16 Engineering project has been designed to encourage students to choose a future in engineering. In September 2006 the first cohort enrolled at King Edward VII School where they studied A level Mathematics, and A levels in Physics, Design and Technology and AS Chemistry at Sheffield Hallam University, where engineering enhancement activities were also arranged. By design the partnership between the school and university continued to share the first delivery of the Advanced Engineering Diploma from September 2008. The units taught and supported at the university use specialist facilities and expertise. This strategy aims to introduce students to the community of practice of engineering. The effectiveness of this strategy has been reviewed in this research. This focussed research has considered: Has this Post-16 Engineering project inspired students to study engineering? How can the Engineering Diploma inspire the next generation of engineers? What lessons are there for educators to learn from this project? Answers to these questions will be used to inform future delivery. Data have been gathered through questionnaires to students and staff.

Where traditional blackboards have been replaced by virtual whiteboards and library books by online resources, teachers are trying hard to cope with the growing competition from technology outside the classroom that has captured their students' attention and imagination, with more technology, perhaps increasing student dependency. However, the author's previous research has shown that engaging e-learning tools to enhance student learning experience is not enough as it has negative impact on students' attitude towards e-cheating, disillusioning their awareness to cyber ethics. So, how do teachers ensure that the methods of teaching and the tools therewith truly enhance student learning and not affect their sense of ethics? As a part of an on-going research, this paper highlights the exponential usage of calculators in the classrooms and their impact on student' attitude towards e-cheating, and recommends further studies to measure the correlation of calculator dependency in the classroom to student attitude towards e-cheating and professionalism at workplaces. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",,"E-learning tool; Educational institutions; Methods of teachings; Online resources; Preliminary studies; Student attitudes; Student learning; Student learning experiences; Curricula; Digital libraries; E-learning; Mathematical instruments; Philosophical aspects; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Ament, P., Hand-held calculators (2007) The Great Idea Finder, , http://www.ideafinder.com, Troy MI url; Tout, N., (2009) Vintage Calculators, , http://inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www. vintagecalculators.com/, About.com.

This is particularly true in professional disciplines such as engineering where discipline specific knowledge rapidly becomes obsolete. Key-skills is the key to success; they help one to excel in the workplace and their importance cannot be denied in this information age. However, it is difficult to teach and assess keyskills as students are not familiar with the importance and relevance of key-skills and lecturers are not familiar how to embed key-skills into the traditional core discipline teaching. In this paper, we will discuss the changes in an electrical engineering programme in Ireland - how curriculum reform has given an opportunity to embed key-skills into the programme.

This paper provides and discusses the results of a pilot study relating to engineering double degrees. The study participants offered opinions relating to non-engineering fields of interest, and why they enrolled in their current double degree course. The study found that double degree students appear to be interested in breadth, but not depth. This finding seems to contradict a prevailing view that double degrees offer students the potential to gain depth in a particular niche or ""overlap area"" between the two degrees. The paper also discusses double degree curricula, in particular, the subjects that are ""omitted"" from a typical double degree. It is noted that some elements that would ordinarily be strongly associated with depth and critical thinking seem to be missing from double degrees.

It is work that is undertaken at significantly reduced cost to a client. While many engineering professionals do undertake pro bono work, when compared with law and medicine, engineering pro bono work is not as well-known, nor does it attract high-profile support and visible recognition. This is despite the fact that the work of engineering organizations typically has great impact, for example by achieving safer water and improved sanitation. However, even though pro bono engineering work may be comparatively less visible, it is definitely occurring, frequently in ways that successfully address local capacity building, health, sanitation, information technology and housing issues among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. This notwithstanding, it seems that a pro bono culture is less developed in the engineering profession than in the legal profession. It is proposed that part of the process for facilitating a pro bono culture within the engineering profession involves engineering education, and that to this end an important step is to understand engineering students' current attitudes and values with respect to the principles of pro bono. Thus this paper provides the results of a preliminary study about students' attitudes and values about pro bono engineering work. The results of this study suggest that only 10% clearly intend to, and a further 20% might, undertake some form of occasional pro bono work at some point in their careers, together with a general understanding of engineering pro bono. A goal of the study is to explore some underlying issues, with a view to making recommendations on the feasibility and viability of possible approaches for supporting greater recognition and adoption of principles of pro bono within the engineering profession. Pro bono in engineering is relatively unexplored as an area for potentially valuable research, and this paper discusses some of the avenues for potential research. It is concluded that there is great potential for mechanisms to be developed to encourage the principles of pro bono to be more effectively embraced by engineering education programs. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Development; Engineering education; Ethics; Pro bono","Development; Engineering organizations; Engineering profession; Engineering professionals; Ethics; Potential researches; Preliminary studies; Pro bono; E-learning; Engineering education; Information technology; Professional aspects","(2003) 8667.0, Legal Practices, , http://www.abs.gov.au/, Australia 2001-02; Evans, A., Recognising the conditional nature of pro bono motivation: Avoiding 'aspirational' compulsion and developing an appropriate pro bono ethic in new lawyers (2003) Second National Pro Bono Conference: Transforming Access to Justice, , Sydney, 20-21 October 2003; (2002) Model Rules of Professional Conduct Public Service Rule 6.1 Voluntary Pro Bono Publico Service, , http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_6_1.html, accessed 5/1/08; Cole, M., Are compulsory targets in the public interest?

However, they are more commonly implemented within the context of flat, 2D content presentation and testing. In some cases an immersive, 3D learning environment may be more compelling, yet implementation of these systems is often costly and resource-intensive, requiring high-cost development tools and hard to find skill sets. This paper describes a low-cost innovative development and implementation of a successful LAN-based HIV, STD, pregnancy prevention middle school curriculum that featured a 3D gaming interface, 2D tailored activities, and video components. The resulting 3D virtual world containing embedded, pre-existing, 2D activities and video at activity stations met criteria for functionality and usability while meeting educational objectives and cost constraints. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"3D learning environment; 3d virtual worlds; Content presentation; Cost constraints; Development tools; e-Learning application; Educational objectives; Middle school students; Computer aided instruction; Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Engineering education","Tortolero, S., Markham, C., Peskin, M., Shegog, R., Addy, R., Escobar-Chaves, L., Baumler, E., It's your game: A multimedia curriculum to prevent HIV/STI and pregnancy for middle schoolers Under Review; Shegog, R., Markham, C., Peskin, M., Dancel, T., Coton, C., Tortolero, S., It's your game: An innovative multimedia virtual world to prevent HIV/STI and pregnancy in middle school youth (2007) MedInfo Congress Series Proceedings, , August; Markham, C., Thiel, M., Spooner, K., McKirahan, N., Shegog, R., Peskin, M., Tortolero, S., Robin, L., Using Intervention Mapping to develop, implement, and evaluate comparable abstinence education and comprehensive sexuality curricula (2007) 135th Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association, , Washington, DC, November 3-7; (2008) Flash Professional Home Page, , http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/, November 21, 2008; (2008) Gamestudio Home Page, , http://www.3dgamestudio.com/, Conitec Datasystems, Inc.

Despite various studies that showed strong influences of emotional state in learning, instructional designers tend to overlook its role when designing and developing instructional materials. This is mainly due to the lack of proper method or framework in linking emotions and instructions. Thus, with recent renewed interest on affective issues in instructions, this paper offers a fresh perspective by integrating Kansei Engineering methodology in the instructional design process. Kansei Engineering is a proven methodology for translating human feelings into a design. This paper describes how Kansei Engineering methods can be used to elicit important design elements of instructional materials that would in turn induce positive emotions on the learners and optimize effective learning. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Cognitive process; Design elements; Effective learning; Instructional designer; Instructional designs; Instructional materials; Kansei Engineering; Positive emotions; Design; E-learning; Engineering education","O'Regan, L., Emotion and e-learning (2003) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 7 (3), pp. 78-92; Martinez, M., Key design considerations for personalized learning on the Web (2001) Educational Technology and Society, 4 (1), pp. 26-40; Martin, B., Briggs, L., (1986) The Affective and Cognitive Domains: Integration for Instruction and Research, , Englewood Cliffs: Educational Technology Publications; Astleitner, H., Designing emotionally sound instruction: The FEASP-approach (2000) Instructional Science, 28, pp. 169-198; Glaser-Zikuda, M., Fub, S., Laukenmann, M., Metz, K., Randler, C., Promoting students' emotions and achievement-Instructional design and evaluation of the ECOLE-approach (2005) Learning and Instruction, 15, pp. 481-495; Kleinginna, P., Kleinginna, A., Categorized list of emotion definitions, with suggestions for a consensual definition (1981) Motivation and Emotion, 5, pp. 345-379; Pekrun, R., The impact of emotions on learning and achievement: Towards a theory of cognitive/emotional mediators (1992) Applied Psychology: An International Review, 41, pp. 359-376; Isen, A.M., Reeve, J., The influence of positive affect on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: Facilitating enjoyment of play, responsible work behaviour, and self-control (2005) Motivation and Emotion, 29 (4), pp. 297-325; Fredickson, B.L., What good are positive emotions?

For some students this can mean that they struggle with particular aspects of the course as they do not have the same depth or breadth of experience as other students or match the teacher's expectation of prior knowledge. One approach to providing support to these students, and also to provide revision or deeper learning for other students, is to provide teaching in a variety of media and supplementary material. Experience shows, however, that those students who might benefit most from this material often do not engage with it. By employing e-learning it is possible to simultaneously address a variety of learning styles, including ones that correspond to students' recreational activities. This has been shown to increase engagement across the spectrum of students. This paper describes an approach used for engineering science and design based subjects at the University of Nottingham using Blackboard/WebCT. This allows on and off campus delivery of multimedia teaching material and the tracking of its use throughout the students' academic careers. Whilst the study presented here is an initial analysis within an on-going project it does show some initial trends albeit with low correlation coefficients, for instance that the higher attaining students are more likely to spend longer amounts of time using e-learning. © 2009 Authors.",,"Academic careers; Engineering degrees; Engineering science; First year; Learning experiences; Learning Style; Low correlation; Prior knowledge; Recreational activities; Teaching materials; University of Nottingham; E-learning; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Teaching; Students","Atherton, J.S., (2009) Learning and Teaching; Deep and Surface Learning, , http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/deepsurf.htm, UK [Accessed: 10 February 2010]; Case, J.M., A critical look at innovative practice from the student perspective (2004) Effective Learning and Teaching in Engineering, , Baillie, C. and Moore, I.

The teaching of the wider business context and, in particular, how a company seeks to remain successful - namely business strategy - is now essential knowledge. How can you endow sufficient comprehension of this important area to undergraduates taking an engineering course? At Coventry University, engineering strategy is taught to approximately 250 full-time direct-entry undergraduate students each year with a diverse knowledge (engineering, economics, and business) and cultural background (several European countries). This year a fictional case-study has been introduced, presented as a story, and released to students on a week-by-week basis over 13 weeks with the aim of engendering sufficient analytical skills in the students as well as the underpinning knowledge to be able to apply a variety of business and operational strategies. The story is supported by in-class group discussion and facilitation by lecturing staff. This paper presents the results from this teaching and learning approach with particular focus on the students' perception of the story and their views on whether it helped their understanding and comprehension. The views from the module teaching team on the efficacy of this method will be discussed. Recommendations for the use of this approach and improvements in next year's delivery will be presented. © 2009 Christopher J. M.

With studies taking place on an international scale to determine how best to attract students from all backgrounds and demographics, much work is needed to understand the dynamics at play that might predict a trajectory towards STEM careers based on factors such as student preparation, motivation, and exposure to STEM. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to model and validate predictors that might determine student interest, readiness, and entrance into an engineering (""E"") track of STEM-related careers. Looking specifically at a statistically representative sample of the U.S. population, this study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to model, with multilevel methods, a comparison between the factors that link with an engineering career pathway to those factors that link to a non-engineering STEM pathway out of the entire cohort of STEM students. The findings suggest that the overwhelming differentiating factor is associated with gender. © 2009 Authors.",,"Engineering careers; International scale; Longitudinal study; Multilevel method; Representative sample; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Science and Technology; STEM careers; Student preparation; Engineering education; Engineers; Population statistics; Students; Vehicular tunnels; Professional aspects","Berryman, S.E., (1983) Who Will do Science?, , New York: The Rockefeller Foundation; Blustein, D.L., Flum, H., A self-determination perspective of exploration and interests in career development (1999) Vocational Interests: Their Meaning, Measurement, and use in Counselling, pp. 345-368. , M.L.

Online behavior is conceptualized in terms of the dimensions of sociability (human connection motives), utility (efficiency orientation), and reciprocity (the need for cognitive stimulation and active involvement when using the Internet). Individuals from various disciplines completed the Brief Test of Online Behavior and received scores on the three dimensions of online behavior. Although variation was apparent, the professional engineer was not distinguished by his scores on sociability, utility, or reciprocity, suggesting that all three dimensions of online behavior should be considered in e-learning. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","E-learning; Engineering education; Internet use; Online behavior; Reciprocity; Sociability; Utility","Internet use; Online behavior; Reciprocity; Sociability; Utility; E-learning; Engineering education","Felder, R., Silverman, L., Learning and teaching styles in engineering education (1988) Journal of Engineering Education, 78 (7), pp. 674-681. , http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/LS-1988. pdf; Felder, R., Matters of style (1996) Prism (American Society of Engineering Education), 6 (4), pp. 18-23. , http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/LSPrism. htm; Holt, J., Solomon, F., Engineering education - The way ahead (1996) Australasian Journal of Engineering Education, 7 (1), pp. 47-60; Mills, J., Ayre, M., Hands, D., Carden, P., Learning about learning styles: Can this improve engineering education?

The learning outcomes of this project are to equip students with the necessary skills to approach real design problems in a systematic way using a structured engineering design process. It is understood by the participating students that this process can increase the ability of companies to expand their existing market share by identifying possible niches through novel designs of their existing product line. Many Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) yet fail to implement such an approach in daily practice. In order to learn the engineering design process through an application in industry, the EGPR team conducted a design exercise aimed at creating conceptual designs of fencing systems with the objective of expanding the market of their UK based industrial partner. Various methods for specifying suitable functions to conceptualise upon were used and compared.

At the same time, other educators declare that ""To teach and study engineering design can be difficult sometimes, especially when transforming theoretical knowledge into practice"" [1], these two arguments can be logically related and support the need to provide high quality hands-on experiences to students. Kolb's model of learning states that concrete and practical experience can be obtained through product dissection activities [2], also known as D/A/A activities (disassemble, analyze, assemble) or more generally as reverse engineering since these activities help reduce the gap between theory and practice in experimental learning environments. To address this issue the author is developing as part of his doctoral research a guiding manual to help engineering design professors implement reverse engineering activities adapted to the requirements of a curriculum in engineering design e.g. specific learning objectives, fundamentals, methodologies, test materials and feedback mechanisms. This project will require the documentation of the theoretical background behind hands-on activities in education and the technical and methodological knowledge needed to conduct reverse engineering exercises so the project's hypotheses can be tested and the research questions answered. Throughout this paper, the descriptions and definitions from authors Blessing and Chakrabarti's book on a design research methodology [3] are presented, along with the comments and experiences obtained while using their framework for the conduction of this research project.","Drm; Engineering design education; Product dissection; Reverse engineering","Design research; Doctoral research; Drm; Engineering activities; Engineering design; Engineering design education; Engineering exercise; Experimental learning; Feedback mechanisms; Hands-on activities; Hands-on experiences; High quality; Methodological knowledge; Practical experience; Product dissection; Research questions; Specific learning; Test materials; Theory and practice; Curricula; Dissection; Education computing; Product design; Research; Reverse engineering; Engineering education","Ogot, M., Okudan, G.E., Simpson, T.S., Lamancusa, J.S., A framework for classifying disassemble/analyze/assemble activities in engineering design education (2008) J.

The two disciplines must work concurrently and in collaboration to produce successful products and, in industry, this is common practice. However, many academic engineering courses in New Zealand focus on technical engineering content and have few links with industrial design. Massey University is unique within New Zealand as its School of Engineering and Advanced Technology provides an academic course in Product Design Engineering, which is co-taught with the School of Design. In 2009, the course was reviewed for accreditation by the Institute of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ). While provisional accreditation was granted, the review highlighted a number of potential concerns around the reduction of technical engineering content required to accommodate increased industrial design content. This paper discusses the results and impact of the 2009 IPENZ review of Product Design Engineering at Massey University in the context of current academic engineering courses in New Zealand. The function of accreditation for professional engineering status for such courses is explored. A case study based review of international academic Industrial Design Engineering and Product Design Engineering courses is conducted to develop solutions to the issues raised. The insights are applied to a redesign of academic engineering courses at Massey University, which will establish a core Design Engineering course.","Engineering education; Product Design Engineering; Professional engineering","Academic course; Advanced technology; Co-taught; Core design; Engineered products; Engineering course; New zealand; Product Design Engineering; Product quality; Professional engineer; Professional engineerings; School of engineering; Technical engineering; Accreditation; Curricula; Product design; Research; Technical presentations; Engineering education","(2009) IPENZ, Graduate Competency Profiles, , http://www.ipenz.org.nz/ipenz/Education_career/accreditation/ Graduate_Competency_Profiles_Nov_2009.pdf, Version 12, Nov; Teichert, T., Donder, K., Wagenfuehrer, D., Design and innovation: Insights from a consumer's perspective (2009) Proceedings of the 17 th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED'09), 5, pp. 325-334. , Brighton, August; Cross, N., (2008) Engineering Design Methods: Strategies for Product Design, , (John Wiley and Sons); Kranke, G., Fully integrating industrial design into engineering education (2008) International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education (EPDE'08), , Barcelona, September; International Engineering Alliance, , http://www.washingtonaccord.org/Washington-Accord/, viewed 16 March 2009; (2009) Requirements for Initial Academic Education for Professional Engineers, , http://www.ipenz.org.nz/IPENZ/Forms/pdfs/ Initial_Academic_Policy_Prof_Eng.pdf, Version 3.1, Nov; De Vere, I., Melles, G., Kapoor, A., Product design engineering - A global education trend in multidisciplinary training for creative product design (2010) European Journal of Engineering Education, 35 (1), pp. 33-43. , March; http://courses.swinburne.edu.au/courses/ Bachelor%2dof%2dEngineering%2d(Product%2dDesign%2dEngineering)%2dPDE50/local, Swinburne University of Technology, viewed 24 March 2009; http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugstudy/course.php?code=014103, The University of Nottingham, viewed 24 March 2009; Grasso, D., Martinelli, D., Holistic engineering Chronicle of Higher Education, 53, pp. B8-B9; Dieter, G.E., Schmidt, L., (2009) Engineering Design, , Fourth Edition (McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York)","Smith, P.; School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, New Zealand",,9781904670193,,"English","DS: Proc.

Graduates are considered by many in industry to be ill-prepared for real world problem solving and to have limited experience in applying their engineering knowledge to product outcomes. Instruction in design is uncommon, and where existing, follows a linear and predictable process that does not afford students opportunity for experimentation and exploration. However new engineering education pedagogy seeks to address these issues through early integration of design and project based learning into the curricula. This paper describes the initial findings of a comparative evaluation exercise conducted to measure relative aptitude in problem solving by two disciplines of final year engineering students and thus validate the impact of new engineering curricula. The evaluated students were from a typical Mechanical Engineering course and from the less conventional Product Design Engineering program which integrates industrial design studies into mechanical engineering curricula. Students' problem solving methods were observed, the design outcomes were evaluated and participants surveyed. These exercises challenged the student's problem framing and solving abilities and required the application of engineering science and design acumen to achieve a creative solution for either an open-ended or constrained problem. The early findings of this ongoing investigation are examined here, and the benefits of developing a creative design focus within an engineering curriculum are clearly evident.","Engineering education; Open-ended problems; Product design engineering; Wicked problems","Comparative evaluations; Constrained problem; Conventional products; Creative design; Creative solutions; Engineering curriculum; Engineering knowledge; Engineering science; Open-ended problems; Problem Solving methods; Product design engineering; Project based learning; Real-world problem solving; Wicked problems; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Mechanical engineering; Product design; Students; Technical presentations; Problem solving","De Vere, I., Developing creative engineers: A design approach to engineering education (2009) 11th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, , Brighton, UK; Stouffer, W.B., Russell, J.S., Oliva, M.G., Making the strange familiar: Creativity and the future of engineering education (2004) 2004 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, , American Society for Engineering Education; Pappas, E., Creative problem solving in engineering design (2002) ASEE SE Section Conference; Cropley, D.H., Cropley, A.J., Fostering creativity in engineering undergraduates (2000) High Ability Studies, 11 (2), pp. 207-218; Fry, R., Defining the obvious: Explaining creativity and design thinking to nondesigners (2006) 2006 IDSA National Education Conference, , Industrial Design Society of America; Rittel, H.W.J., Webber, M.M., Dilemmas in a general theory of planning (1973) Policy Sciences, 4 (2), pp. 155-169; Cross, N., Designerly ways of knowing (1982) Design Studies, 3 (4), pp. 221-227; Atman, C.J., Chimka, J.R., Bursic, K.M., Nachtmann, H.L., A comparison of freshman and senior engineering design processes (1999) Design Studies, 20 (2), pp. 131-152; De Vere, I., Melles, G., Kapoor, A., Product design engineering - A global education trend in multidisciplinary training for creative product design (2010) European Journal of Engineering Education, 35 (1), pp. 33-43; Dym, C.A., Learning engineering: Design, languages and experiences (1999) Journal of Engineering Education, 88 (2), pp. 145-148; Fox, R., Design based studies: An action-based 'form of knowledge' for thinking, reasoning and operating (1981) Design Studies, 2 (1), pp. 33-40; Cross, N., Designerly ways of knowing: Design discipline versus design science (2001) Design Issues, 17 (3), pp. 49-55; Ghosh, S., An exercise in inducing creativity in undergraduate engineering students through challenging examinations and open-ended design problems (1993) IEEE Transactions on Education, 36 (1), pp. 113-119","De Vere, I.; Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia",,9781904670193,,"English","DS: Proc.

There are distinct benefits from using these varied technologies, but are we in danger of losing analogue prototyping techniques that can be more appropriate for early stages of the design process because the students are mesmerised by the technology? The genre of prototyping is becoming ambiguous, it deviated away from the dictionary definition years ago and rightly so, there is not one hard and fast rule for the development of a product per se. This needs to be reinforced in design education as not every design student arrives at the same career destination. The analogue prototyping culture at London South Bank University (LSBU) has a tradition that has stimuli from engineering practice, product modelmaking and even sculpture. This has been used to speculate form and give ideas ""shells"" at the fuzzy front end of a project. Part of the problem with integrating RP systems is the reorientation of units, especially practical workshop units and Computer Aided Design (CAD) units. Without RP systems, it has been difficult to ""test"" data files for full integrity i.e. water tightness and that students can test their creations ""actually"" rather than just ""virtually"". The approach to this problem has been manifold; the first stage was looking at the practicalities of using the software, selecting materials pallets and designing process protocols to prototype on students. Another vital aspect has been investigating the cost of ownership for these systems, costing materials modules holds an interesting educational aspect for the students who, hopefully, will explicitly review the ""worth"" of the materials they are using. The paper will place an emphasis on how product design students engage with this process as part of the product development aspect of their project work, but there is also insight on the relationship between the varied disciplines of engineering and architecture also.","Analogue design; Digital design; Multimodality; Prototyping protocols; Rapid prototyping","Cost of ownership; Data files; Design Education; Design process; Designing process; Digital designs; Educational aspects; Engineering practices; Fuzzy front end; Model-making; Multi-modality; Project work; Rapid prototyping systems; Computer aided design; Network architecture; Product design; Professional aspects; Rapid prototyping; Software prototyping; Students; Engineering education","Paterson, G., Garner, S., Earl, C., Multimodality through physical digital design (2007) Proc. of Conference of International Association of Societies of Design Research (IASDR07), , http://www.sd.polyu.edu.hk/iasdr/proceeding/html/sch_day4.htm, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 12-15 Nov 2007 [online] [Accessed November 2009]; Milgram, (1995) Merging Real and Virtual Worlds, , http://vered.rose.utoronto.ca/people/spike/IMAGINA95/Imagina95.full.html, [online] [Accessed January 2010]; Wilgeroth, P., Gill, S., The unexpected benefits of an integrated CAD/CAM based model making strategy.

It is also one which necessitates that engineering students, who typically have minimal knowledge of medicine, must rapidly and successfully gain a thorough understanding of the intricacies of human anatomy as well as its dedicated language. Teaching on a Bioengineering module at a UK university employed a combination of Primal Pictures anatomical software, human joint models, bespoke teaching materials and peer-to-peer learning.

This has increased the pressure to develop a range of different provision at this level as alternatives to full-time education. Since 2006, the Engineering Council has worked with a number of universities and professional engineering institutions (PEIs) to develop flexible MSc Professional Engineering programmes as pathways to professional qualification. The model of provision adopted integrates the work-based development of Masters level knowledge and understanding with the development of the skills and competence required for CEng status. This paper presents the findings of the interim evaluation of the Gateways to the Profession project, initially funded by the then Department of Education and Science (DfES), and includes feedback from each stakeholder group through questionnaires and interviews. Overall, the responses have been positive and appear to confirm a high level of interest in this type of flexible pathway, as well as highlighting a number of areas that merit further investigation. Whilst the academic content and relevance of the programme is critical to all stakeholders, the quality assurance and administrative infrastructure have proved to be equally important, since the development of documentation that would be acceptable to a range of professional and academic organisations and enable professional accreditation at some point in the future is pivotal for the overall success of the programme. © 2009 Authors.",,"Academic content; Academic requirements; Chartered engineer; Department of Education; Level Of Interest; Professional engineerings; Professional qualifications; Stakeholder groups; Accreditation; Critical infrastructures; Engineering education; Engineers; Image recording; Quality assurance; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Professional aspects","Anderson, G., Boud, D., Sampson, J., (1996) Learning Contracts: A Practical Guide, , London: Kogan Page; (2009) Stepping Higher: Workforce Development Through Employer-higher Education Partnership, , Confederation of British Industry London: CBI; Connor, H., (2007) Workforce Development: What Works and Why, , www.cihe-uk.com/docs/, Council for Industry & Higher Education [accessed 16 January 2010]; (2009) Higher Ambitions: The Future of Universities in the Knowledge Economy, , Department for Business, Innovation & Skills London, DBIS; (2008) UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence, , Engineering Council London.

Some countries are taking action to raise interest in science, technologies, engineering and mathematics and increase the number of students studying these subjects. One of the barriers to young people pursuing engineering is their limited or distorted perception of it - they associate it only with building and fixing things. Young people rarely encounter engineers, unlike other professionals, engineering has little or no advocacy in the media and there are few opportunities to experience engineering. Many of the pupils surveyed at the start of Engineering the Future, a three year EPSRC-funded project, wrote ""dont know what engineering is"" and/or ""would like more information"". This paper reports on work with researchers, policy makers and practitioners in Scotland to develop a sustainable model of activities and interactions that develops pupils understanding of the nature of engineering, embeds experiences of engineering within the school classroom and curriculum and promotes engineering as a career. After learning about engineering through the activities the pupils perceptions had improved. Almost all considered it important that young people know about engineering, because it is an essential part of everyday life and, in the words of one pupil - ""If we know more about it, our minds wouldnt stay closed to it.

There are many reasons for this, but a clear concern is how to actually approach the problem when developing new engineering mathematics modules for first year engineering students. This paper describes a systematic approach to this problem which was supported where possible by the best current pedagogical practices and based on previous experience gained by the authors in this area. This pedagogy is discussed and cited in detail and the efficacy of the endeavour presented along with data relating to the attendance, engagement, enjoyment and attainment of several different cohorts of students over a period of four years. The rationale behind this work was based on the need to radically improve learning in a specific first year engineering mathematics module. The new module was prepared and implemented in a student-centred teaching environment, conforming to a validated approach that the authors had developed and evaluated over three years (2005-2008). To motivate and engage the students, a key consideration was to ensure that the new mathematics module could integrate with the rest of the programme and espouse the same active and collaborative learning strategies inherent in the other more design orientated modules. It is concluded that there is no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to effectively teaching mathematics to engineering students - adopting a thorough systematic approach to implement proven, existing, relevant pedagogy can suffice. © 2009 CD McCartan, JP Hermon, G Cunningham.","Active and interactive learning; Assessment; Content; Declining mathematical skills; Engagement and attainment; Engineering mathematics; Helping engineers learn mathematics (HELM); Learning; Student motivation; Teaching","Assessment; Content; Declining mathematical skills; Engagement and attainment; Engineering mathematics; Helping engineers learn mathematics (HELM); Interactive learning; Learning; Student motivation; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Mathematical techniques; Teaching; Students","Armstrong, P.J., Niewoehner, R., The CDIO approach to the development of student skills and attributes (2008) 4th International CDIO Conference, , Hogeschool Gent, Belgium, June 16-19, 2008; Biggs, J., (1999) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Buckingham: SRHE/OUP, 1999; Carpenter, J., Schröder, B., Mathematical support for an integrated engineering curriculum (1999) ASEE Summer Conference, , session 3565, Charlotte NC, 1999; Challis, N., Gretton, H., Using the SONG approach to teaching mathematics (2008) Proc. of the 14th SEFI MWG Seminar Joint with IMA, , Loughborough, 2008; Crawley, E.F., Malmqvist, J., Östlund, S., Brodeur, D.R., (2007) Rethinking Engineering Education - The CDIO Approach, , New York: Springer; Croft, A.C., Danson, M., Dawson, B.R., Ward, J.P., Experiences of using computer assisted assessment in engineering mathematics (2001) Computers & Education, 37, pp. 53-66. , Elsevier Science Ltd., 2001; Croft, A.C., Davidson, R., (2004) Mathematics for Engineers: A Modern Interactive Approach, , Addison-Wesley, second edition, ISBN 0131 20193-X; Croft, A.C., Ward, T., A modern and interactive approach to learning engineering mathematics (2001) British Journal of Educational Technology, 32 (2), pp. 195-207. , 2001; Davis, L.E., Harrison, M.C., Palipana, A.S., Ward, J.P., Assessment-driven learning of mathematics for engineering students (2005) International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 42 (1), pp. 63-72. , January 2005; (2000) Measuring the Mathematics Problem, , http://www.engc.org.uk/ecukdocuments/internet/document%20library/ Measuring%20the%20Mathematic%20Problems.pdf, Engineering Council UK A report published by the ECUK in June 2000 [accessed 28 January 2010]; Gibbs, G., Simpson, C., Does your assessment support your students' learning?

This proportion of non-completions has been viewed as an excessive loss to the qualified workforce of Australia. Broad brush, government-collected statistics do not, however, provide the level of detail required to understand who leaves, when and why they leave, and where they go. This paper reports on a pilot study undertaken to precede and inform final decisions on research design and methodology for a multi institutional project seeking to understand and reduce student attrition from engineering degrees across Australia. The aim of the project is to produce guidelines on curriculum formulation and delivery strategies to reduce attrition in engineering programs while meeting outcomes. The pilot study was conducted at an institution which has a relatively diverse range of students, a high proportion of whom study part time, and engineering degree structures incorporating traditional and internship-based degrees. Results from a cohort analysis, tracking pathways to completion or non-completion of the degree for the cohorts from two specific entry years will be presented. From this analysis, groups of students who ""persisted over long periods"", ""switched to another degree"" or ""withdrew from the university"" were identified and interviewed. Their experiences and stories, were an essential ingredient for a better understanding of the dynamics of retention/attrition and factors which required further questioning before proceeding with the multi institutional study. © 2009 Authors.",,"Australia; Diverse range; Engineering degrees; Engineering graduates; Engineering program; Engineering undergraduates; Final decision; High demand; Level of detail; Pilot studies; Research designs; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Engineering","Aziz, S.M., Engaging and supporting students in the new common first year engineering program at UniSA (2008) The Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , Paper presented at Yeppoon, QLd; Baillie, C., Fitzgerald, G., Motivation and attrition in engineering students (2000) European Journal of Engineering Education, 25 (2), pp. 145-155; Bernold, L.E., Spurlin, J.E., Anson, C., Understanding our students: A longitudinal study of success and failure in engineering with implications for increased retention (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (3), p. 263; Besterfield-Sacre, M., Atman, C.J., Shuman, L., Characteristics of freshman engineering students: Models for determining student attrition and success in engineering (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (2), pp. 139-149; Brainard, S., Carlin, L., A six-year longitudinal study of undergraduate women in engineering and science (1998) Journal of Engineering Education, 87 (4), pp. 369-376; Cao, Z., Gabb, R., Student attrition at a new generation university (2006) The Australian Association for Research in Education (AARE), , Paper presented at Conference, Adelaide, SA; Cosentino De Cohen, C., Deterding, N., Widening the net: National estimates of gender disparities in engineering (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (3); Cresswell, J.W., (2008) Educational Research: Planning, Conducting, and Evaluation Quantitative and Qualitative Research, , (3rd ed.).

The paper begins by providing a justification as to why sustainability is an important feature of the already overcrowded engineering curriculum, and briefly reports, through illustrative examples, on alternative approaches which currently embed sustainability into the engineering curriculum. The paper makes the case that it is timely now to re-address the learning outcomes in order to enhance the students experience beyond just the inclusion of new curriculum content It does this by consideration of the identified drivers that range from the accrediting bodies and from the aspirations of employers, through revised approaches to embed sustainability, to the consideration of students own perceptions of sustainability and ultimately to their becoming employed as global engineers. The paper therefore discusses both the current and planned work toward supporting the development of engineering graduates into global citizens, with a greater emphasis upon their responsibility to ensure a sustainable future world, moving beyond sustainability awareness towards informed application of sustainability thinking. © 2009 Steiner, Penlington.",,"Alternative approach; Engineering curriculum; Engineering graduates; Illustrative examples; Learning outcome; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Sustainable development","Arnold, J., (2003) Paper Briquetting: An Appropriate Technology.

With more emphasis being placed on flexible learning modes and flexible assessment schemes, examiners are confronted with the review of the existing assessment schemes for the courses they teach. Traditionally, having a combination of assignments and examination has been the most popular method of assessments designed by course examiners. While different assessments give students a variety of opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of a subject, it is important to have a well-formulated assessment scheme to evaluate the students knowledge. When such courses are delivered for both on-campus and external students, achieving the correct balance between various assessment schemes is important while maintaining the quality of assessments. The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) in Australia is reputed for its external delivery of courses where 80% of the students study through this mode. Considering two courses offered at USQ in dual mode as case-studies, this paper highlights the main issues in reaching the right balance when designing assessment schemes, and discusses potential changes to assessment schemes to enhance student learning, as well as effective course delivery. © 2009 Aravinthan, V.",,"Assessment scheme; Australia; Case-studies; Course delivery; Dual modes; Educational environment; Flexible assessments; Learning mode; Potential change; Queensland; Student learning; Undergraduate Courses; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Teaching; Rating","Brodie, L., Transitions to first year engineering - Diversity as an asset (2009) Studies in Learning, Evaluation, Innovation and Development, 6 (2); Brodie, L., Porter, M., Engaging distance and on-campus students in problem based learning (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (4), pp. 433-443; Cercone, K., Characteristics of adult learners with implications for online learning design (2008) AACE Journal, 16 (2), pp. 137-159; Denny, P., Hamer, J., Luxton-Reilly, A., The peerwise system of student contributed assessment questions (2008) 10 th Australasian Computing Education Conference, , Jan 2008, Wollongong, Australia; Devine, J., Assessable online discussion groups as a student learning tool (2009) Proceedings of 20 t Annual Conference for the Australasian Association for Engineering Education: Engineering the Curriculum, , 6-9 Dec 2009, Adelaide, Australia; Felder, M.R., Brent, R., Random thoughts: The 10 worst teaching mistakes (2009) Cheical Engineering Education, 43 (1), pp. 15-16; Fidishun, D., Andragogy and technology: Integrating adult learning theory as we teach with technology (2000) Proceedings of the 2000 Mid-south Instructional Technology Conference, , http://www.mtsu.edu/~itconf/proceed00/fidishun.htm, Murfreesboro, TN: Middle Tennessee State University [accessed 8th January 2009]; Gibbings, P., Brodie, L., Assessment strategy for an engineering problem solving course (2008) International Journal of Engineering Education, 24 (1), pp. 153-161; Greenberg, K., Lester, J.N., Evans, K., Williams, M., Hacker, C., Halic, O., Student learning with performance-based, in-class and leaner-centered, on-line exams (2009) International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, 20 (3), pp. 383-393; Knowles, M.S., Holton, E., Swanson, R.A., (1998) The Adult Learner: The Definitive Classic in Adult Education and Human Resource Development, , 5th edition.

To implement ALL, a new method of delivery, enabled using three key learning technologies, was adopted. The number of formal lectures was reduced and replaced with interactive tutorials as well as additional computer based laboratory sessions. Tutorial sessions were implemented using Interwrite® Personal Response System (PRS), a commercial Audience Response System (ARS). The Multisim® simulation software was introduced in the laboratory sessions to help students visualise the behaviour of electrical and electronic components and apply circuit laws. The adopted assessment strategy combined problem based laboratory together with on-line assessment, created using RESPONDUS®, and an in-class test. Students satisfaction survey, coursework submission rate, focus group as well as informal feedback were used to evaluate the relative benefits of the introduced technology enabled ALL strategies. Laboratory sessions improved students engagement resulting in increased coursework submission rate. ARS promoted group work and interaction, resulting in greater students learning experience. The variety and division of the assessment into small components promoted regular work and was well received by the students. Overall, the adopted strategy had a positive impact on students learning experience, increased students participation in terms of coursework submission which resulted in improved students achievement. The pass rate of the module increased from 70% to 87% and the student satisfaction improved from adequate to satisfactory. © 2009 Jayaraman Ramachandran and Olivier C.L.

The project, funded by the Health and Safety Executive, took 4 years to implement and assess. The outcome was an approach that can be promoted to other higher education institutions on the basis of its success, namely to make undergraduate engineering students more aware of their professional responsibilities for their own safety and the safety of others in their role as engineers. Independently of the above project, the lead author undertook an industrial secondment to Shell Global Solutions (UK), funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering. This paper will describe the development and delivery of a new fourth year module called Major Hazards Management in which many of the risk concepts introduced earlier in the undergraduate programme are given a more detailed treatment for students electing to progress to a deeper specialist level of understanding. Moreover, it will describe how the module, which is part philosophical and part analytical, draws upon the experiences of both the secondment and earlier project to provide the opportunity for students to put into practice the methods used by industry, in particular the oil and gas industry, to manage hazards. A key aspect of the module is the industrial input by specialists who are prepared to pass on their knowledge and experience to the next generation of engineers. © 2010 University of Liverpool and British Crown.",,"Education material; Engineering schools; Health and safety executives; Health and safety laboratories; Higher education institutions; Knowledge and experience; Major hazards; Oil and Gas Industry; Royal Academy of Engineering; Safety risks; Secondment; Shell Global Solutions; Undergraduate curricula; Undergraduate engineering students; Undergraduate engineers; Undergraduate programmes; University of Liverpool; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Gas industry; Hazards; Philosophical aspects; Students","Neale, M., The causes of accidents (2007) The Presidents Choice, , IMechE; Reason, J., (1990) Human Error, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Schleyer, G.K., Duan, R.F., Stacey, N., Role-play experience through virtual reconstruction of accident investigation (2008) Proceedings of International Conference on Innovation, Good Practice and Research in Engineering Education, , Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre, Loughborough; Stacey, N., Simpson, K., Schleyer, G.K., (2009) Integrating Risk Concepts into Undergraduate Engineering Courses, , RR702.

Despite this work and the research of others, we observed some students felt they had nothing to learn from feedback sessions. Hence they missed the opportunity for reflection and to receive feedback to complete the learning cycle. This behaviour suggested that students needed more guidance to facilitate deeper engagement. We hypothesised that student engagement would increase if they were provided with guiding 'feedback catalyst questions' to initiate reflection and facilitate effective feedback on learning outcomes. In this paper we report testing whether this approach assisted students to gain more benefit from the self and peer assessment feedback sessions. In our investigation both students and tutors were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the feedback catalyst questions in improving student engagement and learning. We found that the pre-feedback self reflection exercise improved learning outcomes and student engagement with more than 80% of students reporting multiple benefits. Furthermore tutors reported that the exercise assisted them to facilitate their sessions. However, not surprisingly the degree of success was related in part to the attitude of the tutor to the exercise. This suggests that while the feedback catalyst questions were extremely effective there is no substitute for enthusiastic and engaging tutorial staff. © 2010 Gardner & Willey.",,"Learning cycle; Learning outcome; Peer assessment; Self reflection; Student engagement; Catalysts; Engineering education; Engineers; Rating; Students","Boud, D., Falchikov, N., (2007) Rethinking Assessment in Higher Education Learning for the Longer Term, , Routledge; Dominck, P., Demel, J., Lawbaugh, W., Freuler, R., Kinzel, G., Fromm, E., (2001) Tools and Tactics of Design, , USA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Falchikov, N., Goldfinch, J., Student peer assessment in higher education: A meta-analysis comparing peer and teacher marks (2000) Review of Educational Research, 70 (3), pp. 287-322; Freeman, M., McKenzie, J., SPARK, A confidential web-based template for self and peer assessment of student teamwork: Benefits of evaluating across different subjects (2002) British Journal of Educational Technology, 33, pp. 551-569; Johnston, L., Miles, L., Assessing contributions to group assignments (2004) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 29, p. 751. , 2004; Mello, J.A., Improving individual member accountability in small work group settings (1993) Journal of Management Education, 17 (2), pp. 253-259. , 1993; Michaelsen, L., Knight, A., Fink, L., (2004) Team-based Learning - A Transformative use of Small Groups in College Teaching, , USA, Sylus Publishing; Ramsden, P., (2003) Learning to Teach in Higher Education, , 2nd ed.

While the discipline provides flexible electrical programs for school leavers it also extensively provides upgrading programs to local and international industry based electrical technicians to become professional engineers. To meet the educational needs of students from such diverse backgrounds and to provide an internationalised curriculum creates unique challenges for electrical academics. The quality and timelines of responses to technical queries, from students studying in China, India, Malaysia, or in remote mining towns in Australia, needs to be the same as for on-campus students. To achieve this aim, academics at USQ use learning management system software such as Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle) as a tool to enhance learning in both external and on-campus delivery modes. This paper outlines the preliminary results of how improvements have been achieved using Moodle to enhance learning in Electrical Technology, a first year course. Data obtained so far indicate that greater effort is required by staff to improve student participation on the Moodle discussion forum. Interesting results presented in this paper also show that placing course materials, lectures, assignment marking schemes and solutions on the study desk in Moodle has led to a drastic reduction in attendance for on-campus lectures and tutorials. This trend suggests that the future role of engineering academics is likely to change from the ""classical lecturing"" to one of ""facilitating learning"" using learning management software such as Moodle.",,"Australia; Course material; Delivery modes; Discussion forum; Dynamic learning; Educational management; Educational needs; Electrical program; Electrical technology; Enhance learning; First year; Learning management system; Malaysia; Management software; Object oriented; Professional engineer; Queensland; Remote mining; Student participation; Curricula; Distance education; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Forestry; Teaching; Students","Andrews, T., Daly, C., Using moodle, an open source learning management system, to support a national teaching and learning collaboration (2008) Proceedings of 2008 AaeE Conference, , Yeppoon, Australia; Brotherton, J., Abowd, G., Lessons learned from eclass: Assessing automated capture and access in the classroom (2004) ACM Transactions on Computer-human Interaction, 11 (2), pp. 121-155; Coffield, F., Moseley, D., Hall, E., Ecclestone, K., Learning styles and pedagogy in post-16 learning: A systematic and critical review (2004) Learning and Skills Research Centre, , http://www.hull.ac.uk/php/edskas/learning%20styles.pdf, [accessed 21 January 2010]; Davies, T.J., Davies, J.W., Using part-time students to improve the student experience (2008) Engineering Education: Journal of the Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre; Fang, N., Electronic classroom response system for an engineering dynamics course: Student satisfaction and learning outcomes (2009) Int.

Student ambassador and mentoring schemes are widely held to be effective in aspiration and attainment raising work. Research suggests younger students are influenced by hot sources of information including family members and their peer group rather than the official sources of information available to them. At London South Bank University (LSBU), the London Engineering Project (LEP) has used student ambassadors (SAs) to support the learning of younger students (YSs) from secondary schools in economically deprived and ethnically diverse boroughs of London. The aim has been to raise attainment in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects and to raise awareness of engineering across under-represented groups of students including girls, Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) students and students from lower socioeconomic groups. The ambassadors have been provided with extended training to facilitate their work and engagement with these young people. The evaluation of the LEP suggests that the project has been particularly effective in challenging students negative and gendered preconceptions of engineering and science related careers. This is borne out by the fact that the key boroughs where the LEP has worked have the highest numbers of recruits in the country for the new engineering diplomas. In this article we consider the contribution of the student ambassadors, how the training student ambassadors received has impacted on their work and the implications for developments in future programmes. The research draws on approaches used in social psychology and ethnography to explore the nature of the relationships and the learning that takes place between student ambassadors and younger students. We suggest that understanding the relationship between SAs and YSs and the learning that takes place between them is of central importance to the design of ambassador training. The paper concludes that training has been established on a firm basis but suggests that there should be an increased focus on pedagogy, the learning relationship and the quality of the learning that is taking place. © 2009 Authors.",,"Engineering project; Higher education institutions; Outreach activity; Peer groups; Secondary schools; Social psychology; Training students; Under-represented groups; Undergraduate students; Engineering education; Engineers; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Students","Archer, L., Hutchings, M., Ross, A., (2003) Higher Education and Social Class, , Routledge Falmer: London; Ball, S.J., Maguire, M., Macrae, S., (2000) Choice, Pathways and Transitions Post-16: New Youth, New Economies in the Global City, , Falmer: London; Ball, S., Vincent, C., I heard it on the grapevine (2002) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 19 (3), pp. 377-400. , Hot knowledge and school choice; Butler, J., Gender as performance (2004) Radical Philosophy, 67, pp. 32-39; David, M., Coffey, A., Connolly, P., Nayak, A., Raey, D., Troubling identities: Reflections on judith butlers philosophy for the sociology of education (2006) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 27 (4), pp. 421-424. , September; David, M., (2010) Improving Learning by Widening Participation in Higher Education, , Routledge: Oxon (with Anne-Marie Bathmaker, Gill Crozier, Pauline Davis, Chris Hockings, Gareth Parry, Diane Reay, Ann Vignoles and Julian Williams); Davies, B., Subjectification: The relevance of butlers analysis for education (2006) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 27 (4), pp. 425-438. , September; Gartland, C., Paczuska, A., Student ambassadors, trust and HE choices (2007) Journal of Access Policy and Practice, 4 (2), pp. 108-133. , spring 2007; Gartland, C., Evaluation of the London engineering project (2009) Royal Academy of Engineering, Report for HEFCE; Bauer, M., Gaskell, G., Individual and group interviewing (2000) Qualitative Researching with Text, Image and Sound, pp. 38-56. , London: Sage; Gaskell, G., Individual and group interviewing (2000) Qualitative Researching with Text, Image and Sound, pp. 38-56. , Bauer M. and G.

The session will be based on the learning acquired by the authors during the Open Engineering Resources Pilot Project (OERP). There are three aims of the session; to highlight the work of the project, a practical session to highlight the variety and diversity of OERs currently available for reuse, and to actually create teaching resources from existing available OERs. The workshop will task attendees with the creation of learning resources based upon available OERs aimed at teaching specific learning objectives, incorporating existing OER. The task must be completed using pre-existing OERs available as a result of the project or other similar initiatives, and several members of the OERP team will be on hand to help. By going through the processes involved in the creation of learning resources attendees will be informed about all the steps involved in using and producing OERs. The workshop will provide an opportunity for attendees to discover the range, type and quality of other OERs currently available for reuse. They will come across intellectual property rights (IPR) issues, namely copyright, that they may not have previously considered when producing resources. The task will highlight issues along the use of Creative Commons licences on resources, issues of ownership, the processes involved in requesting permission from rights holders when seeking to use resources, and will provided attendees with an introduction on how these issues should be approached and dealt with in the correct manner, eliminating some of the myths surrounding them. Resources created from the session will also be released in the same way that the base OERs are disseminated. This element will also focus on the issues behind releasing resources under Creative Commons or other 'open licensing' schemes. © 2009 Alex Fenlon & Robert Pearce.",,"Creative Commons; Engineering resources; Engineering sectors; Intellectual property rights; Learning resource; Open educational resources; Pilot projects; Specific learning; Teaching resources; Engineers; Intellectual property; Engineering education",,"Fenlon, A.; Loughborough UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: alex@engsc.ac.uk",,,,"English","Eng.

As well as setting out to meet all UK-SPEC requirements, the entirely new curriculum was developed in line with the syllabus and standards defined by the CDIO Initiative, an international collaboration of universities aiming to improve the education of engineering students. The CDIO ethos is that students are taught in the context of conceiving, designing, implementing and operating a product or system. Fundamental to this is an integrated curriculum with multiple Design-Build-Test (DBT) experiences at the core. Unlike most traditional engineering courses the PDD degree features group DBT projects in all years of the programme. The projects increase in complexity and challenge in a staged manner, with learning outcomes guided by Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. The integrated course structure enables the immediate application of disciplinary knowledge, gained from other modules, as well as development of professional skills and attributes in the context of the DBT activity. This has a positive impact on student engagement and the embedding of these relevant skills, identified from a stakeholder survey, has also been shown to better prepare students for professional practice. This paper will detail the methodology used in the development of the curriculum, refinements that have been made during the first five years of operation and discuss the resource and staffing issues raised in facilitating such a learning environment. © 2009 JP Hermon, CD McCartan, G Cunningham.",,"Bloom's taxonomy; Engineering course; In-line; Integrated course; International collaborations; Learning environments; Learning outcome; Product design and development; Professional practices; Professional skills; Student engagement; Aerospace engineering; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Integration; International cooperation; Model buildings; Product design; Standards; Technical presentations; Students","Bloom, B.S., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook 1, the Cognitive Domain, , New York: David McKay Co.

Moreover, providing detailed feedback on writing to large classes is time consuming. To address this problem, peer assessment (PA) was trialled as a means of giving students practice in, and feedback on their writing. The benefits of PA have been extolled as a means of promoting active learning, facilitating students' understanding of marking processes and helping students to make judgements about quality (Falchikov, 2003; Orsmond, 2004; Bloxham and Boyd, 2007). This paper describes our experiences of trialling and embedding PA of written coursework over a two year period (2008-2010) in a School of Engineering and Material Sciences. PA was initially trialled with a medium sized group (56 students), and more recently, with a large first year cohort (280 students). We describe the design and implementation of these trials which were evaluated through observations, focus groups, questionnaires and interviews with tutors and students. Findings from the evaluation data confirmed our assumption that students would develop a better understanding of tutor expectations. Benchmarking their own work against that of their peers, helped students develop an awareness of quality in report writing. An unanticipated benefit of PA, however, was that students reported checking engineering content and conventions in order to give better feedback. Hence, through 'teaching to learn' (Topping, 2005), peer assessors began to develop both their writing and their engineering knowledge. © 2009 Teresa McConlogue, Jens Mueller and Julia Shelton.",,"Active Learning; Engineering knowledge; First year; Focus groups; Large class; Material science; Peer assessment; Report writing; School of engineering; Benchmarking; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Rating; Surveys; Teaching; Students","(2008) Assessment Standards Manifesto, , http://www.brookes.ac.uk/aske/manifesto.html, ASKe [accessed 7 April 2010]; Baird, J., Greatorex, J., Bell, J.F., What makes marking reliable?

This paper discusses research that demonstrates the importance of these emotional and social competencies as a key non-technical skill set not only for university students but equally for underpinning sustainable success in the graduated engineers professional career development. To obtain a better understanding of the EI skills of engineering students, a study was undertaken at Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This paper reports on the findings into the level of EI skills of first year engineering students (n=243) and an investigation into correlation between student EI subscale valuations and their academic success, as measured by GPA (Grade Point Average). The results suggest that specific EI subscales may provide indication of future academic success. Also briefly discussed is the converse idea, in effect could EI skill scores be used proactively to identify early on (in first semester) those students who might benefit from intervention programs (e.g. student mentoring) thereby resulting in a decrease in student disengagement with the program as well as attrition. © 2009 M.F.

Computer Science and Engineering & Technology have been amongst the poorest performers in this aspect as they ranked in the lower quartile (Surridge, 2007, p. 32). Five years since the first NSS survey, assessment and feedback remains the biggest concern. Dissatisfaction in any aspect of studies demotivates students and can lead to disengagement and attrition. As the student number grows, the situation can only get worse if nothing is done about it. We have conducted a survey to investigate views on assessment and feedback from Engineering, Mathematics and Computing students. The survey aims at investigating the core issues of dissatisfaction in assessment and feedback and ways in which UK Engineering students can learn better through helpful feedback. The study focuses on collecting students' experiences with feedback received in their coursework, assignments and quizzes in Computing Science modules. The survey reveals the role of feedback in their learning. The results of the survey help to identify the forms of feedback that are considered to be helpful in learning and the time frame for timely feedback. We report on the findings of the survey. We also explore ways to improve assessment and feedback in a bid to better engage engineering students in their studies. © 2009 Authors.",,"Computer science and engineerings; Computing science; England; Student numbers; Student surveys; Time frame; Timely feedback; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Rating; Surveys; Students","Barrett, C., Luca, J., Open online assessment: Keeping the tutors honest!

It is the prime delivery method of the UK Open University which has an established Engineering Programme. This paper is an investigation of the provision of generic student support within the Open University's programme. The specific focus is the nature and development of a supportive engineering community within the electonic environment. Such an entity, involving both students and staff would serve to enhance student support throughout their total university experience, be independent of modules and facilitate general professional development - requirements of professional engineering institutes. The investigation looked at trends in the use of existing electronic forums by engineering students, whose opinions were solicited by qualitative and semi-quantitative survey methods. It is found that students require an identified purpose for participation, are pragmatic with a low tolerance of 'social chatter' and are more inclined to engage in non-mandatory activities after some personalised contact with their peers. The above surveys also identified student opinion on the purpose, content, use, format, and perceived benefits of a proposed community. This, along with similar data from other potential stakeholders and information from published literature covering community building and community behaviour were all used to develop an organisational description of an effective community model.

This paper considers the implications of gender on the academic success of male and female students in engineering and spatial science programs. In 2004 the authors began a longitudinal study to identify the key predictors of academic success for a sample of 131 (18 females) on-campus students enrolled in first-year engineering and spatial science programs at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ). Earlier papers reported on the individual differences factors that influenced academic success, showing that previous education achievement (tertiary entrance score) was the key factor in predicting academic success for engineering students during their first year of study (Burton and Dowling, 2005; Dowling and Burton, 2005; Burton, Taylor, Dowling and Lawrence 2009). This paper explores the nature of the relationships between cognitive abilities (spatial and verbal skills), personality, and academic success, for male and female students while they were enrolled in their program. Analysis of the data showed that academic success in first year proved to be a significant predictor of success for the remaining years of the program, and that the personality traits Agreeableness and Emotional Stability contributed to this success. The data also shows that although the attrition rate for the females was more than that for male students, the females were generally successful in first year. Had they continued, they would have successfully completed their engineering program because they had experienced success and had the cognitive abilities and personality traits that predicted success in the longer term.",,"Attrition rate; Australian engineering; Cognitive ability; Engineering educators; Engineering program; Female students; First year; First-year engineering; Individual Differences; Key factors; Longitudinal study; Personality traits; Queensland; Remaining years; Science programs; Verbal skills; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects; Students","(2008) Addressing the Supply and Quality of Engineering Graduates for the New Century, , http://www.altc.edu.au/carrick/webdav/site/carricksite/users/siteadmin/ public/Grants_DBIproject_engineeringquality_project%20report_25march08.pdf, ACED Australian Council of Engineering Deans [accessed 10 October 2008]; Burton, L.J., Dowling, D.G., In search of the key factors that influence student success at university (2005) Higher Education Research & Development Association Conference, , July 2005, Sydney Australia; Burton, L.J., Taylor, J.A., Dowling, D.G., Lawrence, J., Learning approaches, personality and concepts of knowledge of first-year students: Mature-age versus school leaver (2009) Studies in Learning, Evaluation, Innovation and Development, 6 (1), pp. 65-81. , http://sleid.cqu.edu.au, [accessed 28 May 2009]; Cattell, R.B., Cattell, A.K.S., (1965) Manual for the Culture Fair Intelligence Test, Scale 2, , Champaign, IL: Institute for Personality and Ability Testing; Concannon, J.P., Barrow, L.H., A cross-sectional study of engineering students self-efficacy by gender, ethnicity, year and transfer status (2009) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 18 (2), pp. 163-172; Dowling, D.G., Burton, L.J., The end of the pipeline: Profiling commencing students to ease their transition into an engineering school (2005) Proceedings of the 4 th ASEE/AaeE Global Colloquium on Engineering Education, , September 2005, Sydney Australia; (2008) Review of Australian Higher Education: Submission in Response to June 2008 Discussion Paper, , http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/, July, Canberra [accessed 14 October 2008]; Ekstrom, R.B., French, J.W., Harman, H.H., Dermen, D., (1976) Manual for Kit of Factor-referenced Cognitive Tests, , Princeton, NJ: Educational Testing Service; Eysenck, H.J., Personality and the experimental study of education (1996) European Journal of Personality, 10, pp. 427-439; Farsides, T., Woodfield, R., Individual differences and undergraduate academic success: The roles of personality, intelligence, and application (2003) Personality & Individual Differences, 34, pp. 1225-1243; Goldberg, L.R., A broad-bandwidth, public domain, personality inventory measuring the lower level facets of several five-factor models (1999) Personality Psychology in Europe, 7, pp. 7-28. , I.

Students stress levels can be affected by a range of factors, including the nature of their workload. This paper investigates first year engineering students reported stress and workload levels and the reported size, difficulty and learning value of the tasks they are required to perform. The analysis of the gathered data shows that both task size and task difficulty have an impact upon students' perception of stress and workload. Larger and more difficult tasks lead to an increased proportion of students who report higher stress and workload levels. Task size and task difficulty were strongly linked variables - most students who reported that their workload consisted of larger tasks also reported more difficult tasks. Task value, on the other hand, appeared to have only a small impact upon students perception of workload, and appeared to vary independently of students' perceptions of stress. This contradicts the belief that more meaningful tasks do not cause as much stress in students. © 2010 Euan D Lindsay.",,"Engineering degrees; First-year engineering; Stress levels; Task difficulty; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Students","Dee, K.C., Student perceptions of high course workloads are not associated with poor student evaluations of instructor performance (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96, pp. 69-78; Garrett, J.B., Gender differences in college related stress (2001) Undergraduate Journal of Psychology, 14. , GRADUATE CAREERS AUSTRALIA Course Experience Questionnaire Data; Jonkman, M., Boer, F.D., Jagielski, J., Are we over-assessing our students?

We wanted to create a new type of laboratory experience that integrated theoretical and practical teaching for the topic of flow down pipes. Students tend to have difficulty in seeing the connection between theory and practice for this topic. Research by others (Reddi and Mishra, 2003) has shown that students' engagement and learning can be improved by providing visual stimulation through the use of multi-media resources when explaining difficult concepts. So, as a result the Lab-in-a-Box concept was created as a new type of laboratory experience where both practical hands-on resources and also rich multi-media online resources were provided to allow the students to prepare before the practical lab sessions, as well as use during and after the lab. The intention was:. To make the learning activities interesting through the provision of practical and visual online learning resources thus stimulating the students to engage more fully in the learning experience;. To provide students with more opportunities to work independently and in groups thus fostering high order learning skills, as defined by Bloom's Taxonomy, through reducing the amount of face-to-face support but replacing it with scaffolded online learning activities. The results from a formative evaluation study with the first cohort of students are very positive and in particular several students commented positively on the way the videos and presentations had helped them visualise the concept of flow down pipes and helped them with the experiment. © 2009 D.

Although Russell Group universities are recognised as having fewer retention problems than other universities, the challenge remains a significant issue for most engineering Schools and Departments. Two Mechanical Engineering departments at two different Russell Group universities were compared in terms of their initiatives related to engagement and retention of first year students. There were several similarities between the two departments in terms of their student cohorts and comparable initiatives such as a focus on mathematical ability and the use of tutor groups. Differences included the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Sheffield increasing the required A level grades, alongside an emphasis on managing student expectations and a focus on induction week activities. Based on best practice from Strathclyde University, the School of Mechanical and Systems Engineering at Newcastle University has recently introduced engineering teams. Here, students are placed in pre-selected groups of five and encouraged to work in these groups. This encouragement is reinforced by group assignments given to the engineering teams. Initial student feedback on the engineering teams is positive but there remains the opportunity of increased interactivity during most lectures. Retention rates at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Sheffield are higher than those at the School of Mechanical and Systems Engineering at Newcastle University. It remains to be seen how recent initiatives at the latter School will influence retention rates in future. © 2009 T J Joyce and E Rodriguez-Falcon.",,"Engineering schools; Engineering teams; First year; First year students; Group assignments; Interactivity; Mechanical Engineering Department; Mechanical engineering students; Pre-selected; Retention rate; Sheffield; Student expectations; Student feedback; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Mechanical engineering; Societies and institutions; Systems engineering; Students","Boyle, J.T., (2004) The NATALIE (New Approaches to Teaching & Learning in Engineering) Project, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/er/features/natalie.asp, [accessed 30 Dec 2009]; (2009) Performance Indicators in Higher Education in the UK 2006/2007, , http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id= 1438&Itemid=141, [accessed 20 Dec 2009]; (2008) Improving Student Achievement and Widening Participation in Higher Education in England, , http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmpubacc/322/ 32202.htm, House-of-Commons [accessed December 30 2009]; Laing, C., Robinson, A., Johnston, V., Managing the transition into higher education (2005) Active Learning in Higher Education, 6 (3), pp. 243-255; Nicol, D.J., Boyle, J.T., Peer instruction versus class-wide discussion in large classes: A comparison of two interaction methods in the wired classroom (2003) Studies in Higher Education, 28 (4), pp. 457-473; Pulko, S.H., Cutler, G., (2003) Methodologies for Improving Student Progression in Engineering, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/downloads/progress/methodology.pdf, [accessed 30 December 2009]; Thomas, L., Student retention in higher education: The role of institutional habitus (2002) Journal of Educational Policy, 17 (4), pp. 423-442; Willis, L., (2007) Enhancing the First Year Experience for Engineering Students, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/downloads/scholarart/first-year.pdf, [accessed 30 December 2009]","Joyce, T.J.; Newcastle UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: t.j.joyce@ncl.ac.uk",,,,"English","Eng.

Students appreciation of how academic and work-related learning are interrelated and link with future progression, is essential for both the widening participation and retention agendas. Development of transferable skills such as time management, teamwork, project management, report-writing and presentation skills, needs to be articulated and applied in different contexts. Students need to perceive the ongoing value of their learning tasks, which will help promote motivation, self-efficacy beliefs, and self-reliance. Discipline-based support has been shown to be more effective in engaging students in reflective activity, whilst also potentially increasing staff ownership and encouraging integration. This approach is promoted in the Engineering Subject Centres Guide on PDP for Engineering Students, and the revised Guidelines on PDP from QAA (2009) stress the benefits of curriculum integration, highlighting customised approaches as examples of successful PDP implementation. The on-line materials from this project help fill an identified gap in support for engineering students personal and continuing professional development, encouraging skills articulation, critical reflection, self-awareness, and self-presentation skills, thus enhancing their employability. Responses in workshops have been very positive and it is expected that access to discipline-specific materials will provide a catalyst for more explicit PDP activity linked to curriculum tasks, and greater engagement with these processes. Particularly encouraging is the impact on the wider Applied Sciences department, which has resulted in collaborative work to develop similar materials for Computing. © 2009 Andrea Duncan.",,"Applied science; Collaborative Work; Continuing professional development; Critical reflections; Curriculum integration; Engaging students; Learning tasks; On-line materials; Personal development; Presentation skills; Self-efficacy beliefs; Similar material; Time management; Transferable skills; Undergraduate engineers; Widening participation; Work-related; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Project management; Students","(2005) Engineering Subject Centre EASIMAP, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/er/pdp/easimap.asp, Higher Education Academy (accessed Jan 2010); (2005) Engineering Subject Centre Guide: Personal Development Planning for Engineering Students, , Higher Education Academy; (2005) Employability Briefing for Engineering Academics, , HEA - Engineering Subject Centre; What is Reflection?, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/er/pdp/reflection.asp, HEA - Engineering Subject Centre (accessed 28 th Jan 2010); Required Attributes for Leaning, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/er/theory/attributes.asp, HEA - Engineering Subject Centre (accessed 28 th Jan 2010); Personal Development Planning and Employability, , HEA Learning & Employability series 2 (series editor Professor Mantz Yorke); (2008) Effective Practice with E-portfolios, , JISC; Moron-Garcia, S., (2007) Working to Learn - Valuing Placements, , Engineering CETL Loughborough University; (2009) Personal Development Planning: Guidance for Institutional Policy and Practice in Higher Education, , QAA; Stefani, L., Mason, R., Pegler, C., (2007) The Educational Potential of E-portfolios, , Routledge; The Engineering Council UK: Professional Competency Standards Framework UK-SPEC, , http://www.engc.org.uk/ecukdocuments/internet/document%20library/ UK-SPEC%20Standard.pdf, (accessed 28th Jan 2010); The Institute of Engineering Technology: Quick Start Guide to Professional Development, , http://www.theiet.org/careers/cpd/how/quickstart.cfm, (accessed 28 th Jan 2010); Wilcox, J., Developing Professional Skills HEA - UK Centre for Materials Education Guide, , http://www.materials.ac.uk/guides/developing.asp, (accessed 28th Jan 2010)","Duncan, A.; University of NorthamptonUnited Kingdom; email: andrea.duncan@northampton.ac.uk",,,,"English","Eng.

As part of an EC-led national project for the development of work-based learning (WBL) courses leading to Chartered Engineer registration, Aston University has started an MSc Professional Engineering programme, a development of a model originally designed by Kingston University, and build around a set of generic modules which map onto the competence standards. The learning pedagogy of these modules conforms to a widely recognised experiential learning model, with refinements incorporated from a number of other learning models. In particular, the use of workplace mentoring to support the development of critical reflection and to overcome barriers to learning is being incorporated into the learning space. This discussion paper explains the work that was done in collaboration with the EC and a number of Professional Engineering Institutions, to design a course structure and curricular framework that optimises the engineering learning process for engineers already working across a wide range of industries, and to address issues of engineering sustainability.

The problems associated with the level of mathematics and mechanics that students have upon entering higher education, have been well documented over the past few years. In addition, various authors have reported the increasingly diverse body of students entering higher education. The civil engineering programmes at the University of Wolverhampton attract a sizable number of part-time students, many of whom have not studied formally for many years. For this reason the mathematics and mechanics problems are particularly acute. This paper presents the findings of a preliminary study that analyses a continuous diagnostics and support programme that was recently implemented. This programme targets the mathematics and mechanics modules of the first year civil engineering students who started in September 2009. This includes a body of students that have been registered on three different pathways towards a BSc, BEng and HNC award. During the first week of the academic year all students undertook a mathematics and mechanics diagnostic test in order to quantify anticipated weaknesses. The subsequent monitoring and supporting of students has been able to demonstrate some examples of improvements in students' learning which are illustrated in the paper. In addition, findings from the analysis of the student-centred programme are compared with those from past years in order to identify trends in the progression and retention rates. © 2009 Mills, P., Georgakis, P.","Civil engineering; Diagnostics and support; Improved learning; Mathematics and mechanics; Progression and retention","Civil engineering students; Civil engineers; Diagnostic tests; Engineering degrees; Engineering programmes; First year; Higher education; Improved learning; Progression and retention; Retention rate; Student retention; Student-centred; Civil engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Mathematical techniques; Mechanics; Students","(2000) Measuring the Mathematics Problem, , Engineering Council London, Engineering Council; Cousin, G., An introduction to threshold concepts (2006) Higher Education Academy, Planet, (17); Davies, J.W., Part-time undergraduate study in civil engineering - Students from the workplace (2008) Engineering Education: Journal of the Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre, 3 (1); Lawson, D., Halpin, M., Croft, T., After the diagnostic test - What next?

Two of these courses include the first semester course Sustainable Engineering Practice and the second semester course Engineering Design and Innovation. Both courses are targeted at the development of professional practice skills such as communication and teamwork. In these courses ePortfolios are used to help students develop their reflective practice through reflection on learning and reflection/evaluation on individual contribution to group projects. To create the ePortfolios several online assessment methods have been trialed including wikis, blogs, and the ePortfolio program PebblePad. A survey of students computer literacy conducted in 2009 found that students are comfortable with working in this online environment; however their experience is very dependent on what tool is selected, how it is used, and the training provided. Students found the online tools a fresh alternative to traditional assessment methods, however many students were frustrated by the technology and would prefer to focus on learning the subject rather than learning new software. This paper will consider some strengths and weaknesses of the on-line pedagogy and explore why online assessment is not necessarily quick and easy for students or staff. © 2009 Smith E.

Their proliferation has resulted in a high ratio of Chinese students in some Engineering courses. This paper interrogates such a site where a 2+2 agreement between a Chinese and British university has produced engineering learning contexts where Chinese students are in the majority. The paper draws upon a longitudinal ethnographic study of 50 Chinese undergraduate Engineering students, conducted over 15 months in China and the UK. In-depth interviews and participatory observations were conducted to collect data. Constructive grounded theory analytical approaches were adopted to analyse the data. Findings reveal that the Chinese students contribution to the revenue and internationalization of the university culture has impelled the host school to start to link with the Chinese university closely at academic level. The effort in facilitating Chinese students transition through early intervention and academic exchange has made the two teaching and learning contexts more connected. The presence of this large cohort of Chinese students also has motivated some of the academic staff to modify their teaching to adjust to students learning. However, this kind of adjustment has caused some complaints from the other students in the class. The social disintegration and unfamiliarity amongst students at the initial stage have had a negative effect on peer learning. Structured contacts have benefited the integration of the multinational class, which has enhanced the peer learning in the class. Studying with Chinese students also enables home students to reflect on past learning experiences and this highlights a gap among secondary school, college and university education, which could be a potential obstacle to young people studying Engineering. © 2010 Heather Hawthorne and Rachel Epson.",,"Academic level; Academic staff; Analytical approach; British University; Chinese students; Chinese universities; Early intervention; Engineering course; Engineering degrees; Engineering learning; Ethnographic study; Grounded theory; In-depth interviews; Initial stages; Learning experiences; Peer learning; Secondary schools; Students learning; Teaching and learning; Undergraduate engineering students; University education; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Technical presentations; Students","Brewer, J.D., (2000) Ethnography, , Buckingham: Open University Press; (2008) China Market Introduction, , http://www.britishcouncil.org/eumd-information-background-china.htm, [Accessed: 27 November, 2008]; Brown, S., Jones, E., Introduction: Values, valuing and value in an internationalised higher education context (2007) Internationalising Higher Education, , Jones, E. and Brown, S.

The results of research conducted at the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the University of Rijeka during 2006 and 2009 showed that employers and former students were not happy with a level of these competencies developed during the study for a civil engineering degree. This is one of the reasons why the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Rijeka has been implementing different approaches in the teaching-learning process in order to improve students' competencies and skills. It starts with developing students' awareness about sustainable development and follows by implementation of sustainable development principles in planning, designing and building of civil engineering structures. Students are given the opportunity to be involved in sustainable development projects (application to Solar Decathlon 2012 in Madrid, Spain). The Faculty collaborates with the Lancaster University (UK) in delivering their field course 'Water and environmental management in Mediterranean context'.

Study of 200 years of elementary textbooks reveals that since WWII the metaphoric basis for vector algebra has been progressively weakened, suggesting that the academic community has been partly culpable in the creation of this problem. As part of research into the illustration of elementary mechanics, an experimental method has been devised to teach first year graphic design students the ubiquitous nature of Newton's 2nd Law. Their ability to analyse the effect of the Earths rotation on themselves is then used to test the efficacy of the teaching method. The experience of the pilot study indicates that mathematically unmotivated students can quickly acquire and apply elementary mechanical principles. The results of the main study now under way will be available at the conference. The next stage is to test the hypothesis that a strengthened metaphoric understanding of vectors will improve the students ability to implement the mathematical solutions. It is proposed to design a 2 credit course on elementary mechanics, which does not use mathematics, that can be incorporated into school, FE or HE Year 1 curricula. The subsequent performance of students undertaking this course can then be compared to those not having that experience. © 2010 Peter J.Vivian.",,"Academic community; Experimental methods; First year; Graphic design; Higher education; Mathematical solutions; Mechanical principles; Pilot studies; Teaching methods; Vector algebra; Design; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Teaching; Curricula","Barthes, R., (1964) Elements of Semiology, , Translated from the French by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith.

Learning by traditional teaching methods the theory of how to structure software, the specific language used and implementation requires a great deal of precision, perseverance and hard work on the part of the student. Many students fail to engage and become de-motivated before they have a chance to develop competence. This is partly because they fail to see how programming can be used outside of a PC environment, or how it is of any relevance to their programmes of study. This paper describes the development of a method for addressing these issues through the use of a programmable robot. Students work in multi-disciplinary teams using a flowchart-based system to program the robot. This removes the syntax related problems that students tend to encounter, while maintaining an algorithm development challenge. Each team is set a number of challenges they have to meet in order to qualify for a competitive race event. With this experience they should be better placed to study the challenges of a complex programming language with its syntax and structure, and be able to see how programming fits into the wider scope of engineering activity. 127 students were given questionnaires to assess their attitudes to programming both before and after the project, and initial findings indicate a significant improvement. © 2009 Authors.",,"Algorithm development; Engineering activities; Engineering course; Hard work; Multi-disciplinary teams; Programming language; Specific languages; Teaching methods; Computer programming; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Flowcharting; Surveys; Syntactics; Teaching; Technical presentations; Students","Bulman, T., Peer assessment between students in colleges and universities (1998) Review of Educational Research, 168 (3), pp. 249-277; Carlisle, M.C., Wilson, T.A., Humphries, J.W., Hadfield, S.M., Raptor: Introducing programming to non-majors with flowcharts (2004) Journal of Computing in Small Colleges, 19 (4), pp. 52-60; Crews, T., Zieger, U., The flowchart interpreter for introductory programming courses (1998) Proceedings of the FIE98 Conference, pp. 307-312; Erwin, B., Cyr, M., Rogers, C., LEGO engineer and ROBOLAB: Teaching engineering with LabVIEW from kindergarten to graduate school (2000) International Journal of Engineering Education, 16 (3); (2010), http://www.matrixmultimedia.com/flowcode.php, [accessed 6 September 2010]; (2010), http://www.kicchip.co.uk/, [accessed 6 September 2010]; Kolb, D., (1984) Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development, , Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall; Kommula, V., Oladiran, M., Uziak, J., Self and peer assessment in engineering students group work (2009) AAEE Proceedings of 20 th Annual Conference, pp. 937-942; Mehrl, D.J., Parten, M.E., Vines, D.L., Robots enhance engineering education (1997) Frontiers in Education Conference Proceedings; Miller, D.P., Winton, C., Botball kit for teaching engineering computing (2004) Proceedings of the ASEE National Conference, , ASEE; Mondada, F., Bonani, M., (2008) E-puck Educational Robot, , http://www.epuck.org; Murphy, R.R., ""Competing"" for a robotics education (2001) Robotics and Automation Magazine, IEEE, 8 (2), pp. 44-55; Pears, A., Seidman, S., Malmi, L., Mannila, L., Adams, E., Bennedsen, J., Devlin, M., Paterson, J., A survey of literature on the teaching of introductory programming (2007) ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 39 (4), pp. 204-223; (2010) PICAXE Software, , http://www.rev-ed.co.uk/PICAXE/software.htm, [accessed 6 September 2010]; Ploetzner, R., Learning by explaining to oneself and to others (1999) Collaborative-learning: Cognitive and Computational Approaches, pp. 103-121. , P.

Over five years a second-year engineering design course has been nurtured to focus on developmental projects associated with sustainability which emphasise hands-on learning. Students work in groups, with recent projects focusing on the design of domestic scale wind turbines. The design is taken from concept through manufacture to final testing using a wind tunnel. The commercial and societal relevance of the project is emphasised, as is the need for team-working. Each team is given a budget of £100. The majority of the timetable is devoted to laboratory sessions where hand and power tools are available. Assessment methods include presentations, formal reports, weekly updates and individual logbooks. Learning outcomes are based on UK-SPEC. Creativity and innovation are encouraged throughout the design process. Regular assessment occurs throughout with an emphasis on rapid, formal feedback. Student feedback improves year on year and student attendance is maintained above 90%. The key features which have led to success are allowing students to take a paper design through to manufacture (encompassing the hands-on and realistic aspects of engineering) and trusting in students creativity. Both areas led to students having a sense of ownership of their learning and developing into professional engineers. Assessment workload for staff is high but is seen by students as evidence of staff commitment to their learning. © 2009 T J Joyce, I Evens and W Pallan.",,"Assessment methods; Design process; Engineering department; Engineering design; Engineering design course; Hands-on learning; Key feature; Laboratory sessions; Learning outcome; Power tools; Professional engineer; Student feedback; Curricula; Design; Engineers; Manufacture; Rating; Students; Sustainable development; Engineering education","Abdulwahed, M., Nagy, Z.K., Richard, B., Using hybrid feedback control engineering for designing effective project based learning (2008) International Conference on Engineering Education, , Pecs, Hungary, 27 - 31 July 2008; Bramhall, M., Radley, K., Metcalf, J.E.P., Users as producers: Students using video to develop learner autonomy (2008) Engineering Education 2008, , Loughborough, UK, 14 - 16 July 2008; Johnson, P.A., Problem-based, cooperative learning in the engineering classroom (1999) Journal of Professional issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 125 (1), pp. 8-11; Lambert, C., Basini, M., Hargrave, S., The activity led learning within aerospace at coventry university (2008) Engineering Education 2008, , Loughborough, UK, 14 - 16 July 2008; Lindsay, E., Munt, R., Rogers, H., Scott, D., Sullivan, K., Making students engineers (2008) Engineering Education, 3 (2), pp. 28-36; Powell, N., Van Silfhout, R., Hicks, P., Using enquiry-based learning (EBL) to prepare students for group work: Lessons from successive implementations (2008) Engineering Education 2008, , Loughborough, UK, 14 - 16 July 2008; (2005) Educating Engineers in Design, , http://www.raeng.org.uk/news/publications/list/reports/ Design_Engineering.pdf, (Accessed: 20 April 2010); Steiner, S., Arthur, A., Beech, N., Embedding teamworking and teamskills into an engineering degree programme - Various models (2008) Engineering Education 2008, , Loughborough, UK, 14 - 16 July 2008; Willmot, P., Pond, K., Loddington, S.P., Palermo, O.A., Perceptions of peer assessment in university teamwork (2008) International Conference on Engineering Education, , Pecs, Hungary, 27-31 July 2008","Joyce, T.J.; Newcastle UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: t.j.joyce@ncl.ac.uk",,,,"English","Eng.

The educational background of students has moved away from traditional Alevel maths and science and if anything this variation is set to increase with the introduction of engineering diplomas. Another major change to the circumstances of undergraduate students relates to the introduction of tuition fees in 1998 which has resulted in an increased likelihood of them working during term time. This may have resulted in students tending to concentrate on elements of the course that directly provide marks contributing to the degree classification. In the light of these factors a root and branch rethink of the electronic engineering degree programme structures at Aston was required. The factors taken into account during the course revision were:. Changes to the qualifications of incoming students. Changes to the background and experience of incoming students. Increase in overseas students, some with very limited practical experience. Student focus on work directly leading to marks. Modular compartmentalisation of knowledge. The need for provision of continuous feedback on performance We discuss these issues with specific reference to a 40 credit first year electronic engineering course and detail the new course structure and evaluate the effectiveness of the changes. The new approach appears to have been successful both educationally and with regards to student satisfaction.

This required discussing the students expectations of written feedback with both staff student liaison committees and departmental staff meetings. Underpinning the development of the strategy was a strong wish not to impose a uniform approach on staff and also to make clear that a well designed feedback system can reduce staff time spent on marking rather than increase it. Examples of different approaches to feedback were developed and debated at staff meetings. Also discussed was the link between learning outcomes, marking schemes and the type of feedback to give students. With the individual investigative project modules, feedback sheets were developed to reflect the different expectations from BEng and MEng students as stated in the Engineering Councils UK-SPEC publication. It was agreed by staff that the minimum a student could expect was a generic feedback sheet for the whole cohort and that ideally all written feedback should be individual. To ensure both timely return of coursework and to allow spot checks of the level of feedback to students, a central coursework return point for staff was established. The department sees its strategy on coursework as an ongoing process and has improved the response from its students on feedback year on year as evidence by the National Student Survey. © 2009 J.L Horner.",,"Feedback systems; Feedback to students; Learning outcome; Loughborough University; Staff time; Student feedback; Student surveys; Written feedback; Automotive engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Surveys; Students","(2007) Guidance Notes on Academic Accreditation, , EC-UK London: Engineering Council UK; (2004) UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence: The Accreditation of Higher Education Programmes, , Engineering Council UK London: Engineering Council UK; Hibbert, L., Training focus: Degrees of separation (2008) Professional Engineering, 21 (6), pp. 43-44; QAA framework for higher education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (2004) Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, , Quality Assurance Agency","Horner, J.L.; Loughborough UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: j.l.horner@lboro.ac.uk",,,,"English","Eng.

This paper reflects on the advantages and challenges of an integrated team approach for this project. Briefly benefits have included effective transfer of knowledge and good working practices, as well as novel approaches to the creation of material. Whilst challenges have included the steep learning curve and the need to assess technologies at the same time as material creation, with an underestimation of the training requirements at the beginning of the project. The e-learning objects created within this project are being used throughout the 2009-10 academic year and feedback is being collected from students to assess the effectiveness of the material. Initial feedback is positive but the data is too sparse at present to produce a robust analysis.

Universities and engineering accreditation bodies have responded to this by requiring that engineers complete elements of group work in their undergraduate and postgraduate studies. However in an environment of ever increasing student numbers teaching collaborative skills through group work has become both a pedagogic and logistical challenge. This paper argues that the use of web 2.0 collaborative tools such as wikis may offer academic staff a safe passage through this challenge. It describes the design and delivery of a collaborative wiki-based coursework project on a module in the Masters in Management of Projects at The University of Manchester. The module is delivered on campus to 250 postgraduate students, introducing them to the financing, structuring and management of infrastructure projects. The wiki-based coursework project was delivered using the Confluence wiki tool running within the universitys Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Students were required to organise themselves into groups, and to formulate and investigate their own research topic based on a real life infrastructure project. The outcomes of the project included an enhanced student learning experience, improved collaborative working and cohort cohesion on a large postgraduate programme and generated new course content for future student cohorts. In addition the project served as a tested pilot study of the use of wikis prior to roll-out across other programmes at The University of Manchester. © 2009 Authors.",,"Academic staff; Collaborative learning; Collaborative tools; Collaborative working; Course contents; Engineering accreditation; Group work; Infrastructure project; Multi-disciplinary; Pilot studies; Postgraduate students; Research topics; Student learning experiences; Student numbers; University of Manchester; Virtual learning environments; Web 2.0; Accreditation; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Teaching; Web services; Students","Berkman, R., The wild, wonderful, world of wikis (2004) Knowledge Management: A Quarterly Supplement Exclusively for the Information Advisor Reader, 8 (4), pp. 1-4; Biggs, J., (1999) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Buckingham: Society for Research in Higher Education and Open University Press; Bold, M., Use of wikis in graduate course work (2006) Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17 (1), pp. 5-14; Bruner, J., (1960) The Process of Education, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bruns, A., Humphreys, S., Wikis in teaching and assessment: The M/cyclopedia project (2005) 2005 International Symposium on Wikis, , 16 - 18 October 2005, San Diego, CA; Cole, M., Using wiki technology to support student engagement: Lessons from the trenches (2009) Computers and Education, 52, pp. 141-146; Cronin, J., Upgrading to web 2.0: An experiential project to build a marketing wiki (2009) Journal of Marketing Education, 31 (1), pp. 66-75; Da Lio, E., Fraboni, L.L., Leo, T., TWiki-based facilitation in a newly formed academic community of practice (2005) 2005 International Symposium on Wikis, , 16-18 October 2005 San Diego, CA; Duffy, P., Bruns, A., The use of blogs, wikis and RSS in education: A conversation of possibilities (2006) Proceedings of the Online Learning and Teaching Conference 2006, , 26 September 2006, Brisbane Australia; Elgort, I., Smith, A., Is wiki an effective platform for group coursework (2008) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 24 (2), pp. 195-210; (2004) UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence, 2004, p. 11. , www.engc.org.uk, Engineering Council [accessed 18 January 2010]; Engstrom, M.E., Jewett, D., Collaborative learning: The wiki way (2005) TechTrends, 49 (6), pp. 12-68; Ferris, S., Wilder, H., Uses and potentials of wikis in the classroom (2006) Innovate, 2 (5). , http://www.innovateonline.info/pdf/vol2_issue5/ Uses_and_Potentials_of_Wikis_in_the_Classroom.pdf, [accessed 18 January 2010]; Gerlach, J.M., Is this collaboration?

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Kolb's Learning Styles were the main focus, with minor assessment included based on both tools. Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Kolb's Learning Styles both offer an insight into the inner workings of a team; why some teams are successful and why some teams do not work effectively together. Students were then encouraged to use the knowledge gained through these studies and apply to later teamwork based assessments, both in this course and onto future courses. Through the study of both Myers-Briggs and Kolb, students were given the opportunity to gain a better understanding of themselves in the hope this would further develop the skills being taught in the course. This paper investigates the effectiveness of these two learning techniques in teaching teamwork and communication skills from a student's perspective and the general consensus of other students who participated in the course. © 2009 Authors.",,"Communication skills; First-year engineering; Learning Style; Learning techniques; Learning tool; Myers-Briggs Type Indicators; University of Adelaide; Communication; Engineering education; Engineers; Students","Artemeva, N., Logie, S., St-Martin, J., From page to stage: How theories of genre and situated learning introduce help introduce engineering students to discipline-specific communication (1999) Telecommunications Quarterly, 8 (3), pp. 301-316. , Summer 1999; Back, W.E., Sanders, S.R., Industry expectations for engineering graduates (1998) Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, (2), pp. 137-143; Bruner, J., (1960) The Process of Education, , Harvard University Press, Harvard; Chen, S.J., Lin, L., Modeling team member characteristics for the formation of a multifunctional team in concurrent engineering (2004) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 51 (2), pp. 111-124. , May 2004; Coates, G., Duffy, A.H.B., Whitfield, I., Hills, W., Engineering management: Operational design coordination (2004) Journal of Engineering Design, 15 (5), pp. 433-446. , October 2004; Culp, G., Smith, A., Understanding of psychological type to improve project team performance (2001) Journal of Management in Engineering, pp. 24-33. , January Issue; Einstein, H.H., Engineering change at MIT (2002) Civil Engineering, 72 (10), pp. 62-69; Darling, A.L., Dannels, D.P., Practicing engineers talk about the importance of talk: A report on the role of oral communication in the workplace (2003) Communication Education, 52 (1), pp. 1-16. , January 2003; Hargrove, S.K., Wheatland, J.A., Ding, D., Brown, C.M., The effect of individual learning styles on student GPA in engineering education at morgan state university (2008) Journal of STEM Education, 9 (3-4), pp. 37-46. , July-December 2009; Kisa, S.J., Personality Test, , http://kisa.ca/personality, Accessed on 3 rd October 2009; Kolb, D.A., (1979) Learning Style Inventory: Technical Manual, , McBer & Company, Boston; Kolb, D.A., Boyatzis, R.E., Experiential learning theory: Previous research and new directions (2001) Perspectives on Thinking, Learning and Cognitive Styles, pp. 227-243. , Ed.

Participants will take part in a manual simulation to achieve some learning outcomes and will then discuss this approach and alternatives to achieving the same learning outcomes. The purpose of this game is to introduce Optimised Production Technology (OPT) principles for scheduling and materials control in manufacturing systems. The game was initially designed as part of a 2 day course for British Aerospace in Materials Management and has subsequently been used with a wide variety of ages and ability levels, from schoolchildren aged 12/13 years through degree students to professionals in related areas. The game is to run a production system for a period of time to make a profit. The product is simply two pieces of folded paper stapled together in the general shape of an aeroplane. The processes and process routes are similarly straight forward so participants can quickly understand the requirements of the game, however making a profit is not always as easy. The OPT rules and other issues are brought out in the discussion and analysis of the system. The same topic has been delivered using a variety of methods including traditional lecture, a shortened version of the game, computer based simulation game and various combinations of these. These experiences and the experience of participants will be discussed in groups ending with a plenary. © 2009 L K Legg.",,"British aerospaces; Computer based simulation; Learning Activity; Learning outcome; Materials management; Process route; Production system; Production technology; Engineering education; Profitability; Engineers","Larivee, B., Transforming teaching practice: Becoming the critically reflective teacher (2000) Reflective Practice, 1 (3), pp. 293-307; Jackson, M., Making visible: Using simulation and game environments across disciplines (2004) On the Horizon - The Strategic Planning Resource for Education Professionals, 12 (1), pp. 22-25; Martin, D., McEvoy, B., Business simulations: A balanced approach to tourism education (2003) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 15 (6); Race, P., (2006) The Lecturers Toolkit - A Practical Guide to Learning Teaching & Assessment, , (3 rd Ed) Abingdon.

Therefore, students need to learn to cope with the uncertainty that goes with their future career. In addition the needs of industry and university engineering degree programmes do not always align. It is also difficult for some companies to engage with the university sector, to enter into a planned conversation about their current and future skill requirements. Research conducted by the authors investigates how linking students with employers throughout their degree study closes the employer-university gap and better prepares students for the workplace. It collects evidence from sponsored and placement undergraduate engineering students within the Engineering Faculty at Loughborough University. The research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to collect and analyse data in order to identify professional skills development in the students and how a long term relationship between students and employers impacts on this. The results also present the views of the employers on their relationship with both the students and the university, together with their perception on how this link enables industry input into the curriculum. Conclusions are drawn on the benefits that long-term links between students and employers offer. © 2009 Soltani-Tafreshi, Twigg, and Dickens.",,"Effective practices; Engineering degrees; Engineering faculty; Industry change; Loughborough University; Professional skills; Quantitative method; Skill requirements; Term relationship; Undergraduate engineering students; Biographies; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Industry; Students","Department for Business Innovation and Skills - Higher Ambitions, , BIS 2009 Crown; Bowen, E., Prior, J., Lloyd, S., Thomas, S., Newman-Ford, L., Engineering more engineers -bridging the mathematics and careers advice gap (2007) Engineering Education: Journal of the Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre, 2 (1), pp. 23-32; Brown, G., (2005) Doing Pedagogical Research, , Loughborough University: engCETL; (2003) The Future of Higher Education, , Department for Education and Skills (white paper); Dickens, J.G., Industry input into the education of construction engineers (2006) International Conference on Building Education and Research, , 2006, Hong Kong China; Foley, S., Sponsorship (2004) Everything You Wanted to Know About Sponsorship-placements-graduate Opportunities, pp. 27-32. , Walden, R.

Moreover, UK policy documents highlight the value of embedding engineering into the school curriculum, arguing that programmes aimed at inspiring children through a process of real-life learning experiences are vital pedagogical tools in promoting engineering to future generations. Despite such attention, engineering education at school-level remains sporadic, often reliant on individual engineering-entrepreneurs such as teachers who, through personal interest, get children involved in what are usually extra-curriculum, time-limited engineering focused programmes and competitions. This paper briefly discusses an exploratory study aimed at investigating the issues surrounding embedding engineering into the primary school curriculum. It gives some insight into the perceptions of various stakeholders in respect of the viability and value of introducing engineering education into the primary school curriculum from the age of 6 or 7. A conceptual framework of primary level engineering education, bringing together the theoretical, pedagogical and policy related phenomena influencing the development of engineering education is proposed. The paper concludes by arguing that in order to avert future societal disaster, childrens engineering imagination needs to be ignited from an early age and that to do this primary engineering education needs to be given far more educational, social and political attention. © 2009 Authors.",,"Childrens; Conceptual frameworks; Early age; Exploratory studies; Future generations; Learning experiences; Pedagogical tools; Policy documents; Primary schools; School careers; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects","Anderson, J.R., (1995) Learning and Memory: An Integrated Approach, , Chichester: Wiley; Brophy, S., Klein, S., Portsmore, M., Rogers, C., Advancing engineering education in P-12 classrooms (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 369-387. , July 2008; Coon, D., (1983) Introduction to Psychology, , St Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing. 3 rd Edition; Cummings, L., Qualitative research in the infant classroom: A personal account (1985) Issues in Educational Research: Qualitative Methods, pp. 216-250. , Burgess, R., (ed) Lewes.

Answer: To get to the other side! Engineers, being logical people, usually have a purpose for everything they do. So although using humour in an engineering lecture may make the experience more enjoyable for students is there actually a useful purpose to the exercise? Neurological evidence shows humour can (among other things) increase memory retention and temporarily reduce distractions from pain, stress or fatigue further increasing learning capacity. From first hand experience even a small distraction during a lecture, whether internal or external can affect concentration reducing the effectiveness of the presentation. A humorous lecture captures the attention of the audience and combined with the neurological evidence for humour in learning provides an effective tool in engineering education. Humour has been successfully used as a tool in engineering lectures at The University of Adelaide, however, sometimes the end result was not desired or the humour distracted too much from the primary lesson of the lecture. These lectures have been reviewed from a student's perspective and an analysis of the outcomes discussed, showing that if used wisely, humour can be an extremely effective tool in engineering education. © 2009 Authors.",,"Effective tool; Engineering lecture; Learning capacity; Lecture capture; Memory retention; University of Adelaide; Engineering; Engineers; Students; Technical presentations; Engineering education","Adams, P., Mylander, M., Good health is a laughing matter (1992) Caring Magazine, pp. 16-20. , Dec 92; Bear, M.F., Connors, B.W., Paradiso, M.A., (2006) Neuroscience, Exploring the Brain, , USA: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; Brenmar, J.D., Does stress damage the brain?

The most obvious downside is that many students resist attempts to move away from a lecture based, or teacher-led, approach to a more student centred or student-led approach to learning. This paper focuses on one aspect of that challenge in the authors department, that is, how do we convince students as they arrive at University of the need to accept independent learning as the long term norm and in particular to practise this immediately in their learning of MATLAB software. The paper suggests a joined-up delivery of the curriculum but focuses more on the use of FLASH lecture resources to help students bridge the gap between lecture-led courses and total autonomy. © 2009 Authors.",,"Learning skills; Matlab- software; Student-centred; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Students","CILASS, , http://www.shef.ac.uk/cilass/, [accessed 13 January 2010]; Cugnasca, P.S., Junior, J.B.C., Junior, J.R.A., Experiences in cooperative computer engineering course at the university of sao paulo (2007) ICEE07, , Portugal; EASIMAP, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/er/pdp/easimap.asp, [accessed 13 January 2010]; http://www.engc.org.uk/professional-qualifications/standards/uk-spec.asp x, Engineering Council [accessed 13 January 2010]; Fidler, A., Middleton, A., Nortcliffe, A., Providing added value to lecture materials to an iPod generation (2006) 6th Conference of the International Consortium for Educational Development, , Sheffield, UK, June 2006; Intons-Peterson, M.J., Fournier, J., External and internal memory aids: When and how often do we use them?

It then discusses the aims of the Engineering Diploma - a qualification for 14-19 year olds in the UK - and the pedagogical research that that has informed the design and development. The paper highlights the key learning theories that support the delivery of this qualification and provides an example of how this pedagogy has been applied effectively through the curriculum partnership that has been developed between a consortium of schools in the Birmingham local authority, Aston University and employers. It establishes the importance of aligning the curriculum and articulating clear engineering progression routes from the age of fourteen to enable young people to be inspired and motivated towards careers in engineering. The paper presents the view of parents, teachers and pupils involved with the Diploma, during the first year, and the way in which the partnership is informing future developments in the delivery of engineering curriculum within the region. The success of this regional partnership model has resulted in the Department of Children, Schools and Families agreeing to fund the development of the Aston University Engineering Academy Birmingham. This is a school for 14-19 year olds that will open in 2012 on the Aston Science Park adjacent to the University.

It is argued [1, 2] that EBL provides students with an inspirational learning experience through which they develop subject knowledge, professional and personal skills as well as attributes ranging from teamwork and leadership skills to problem solving and information literacy. They can also develop attitudes such as acceptance of responsibility for their own learning and actions. At the heart of EBL is an environment in which the learners are supported in determining their own lines of enquiry: identifying what is already known about a topic; what needs to be learned; what information is required; how it is to be acquired, processed and applied; and how it is to be shared with others [1]. Development of this general pedagogy attempts to engage with an increasing range of engineering disciplines by building on well-established approaches to teaching and learning within those disciplines. These approaches may be described by terms such as Problem Based Learning (PBL) [5]; design exercises; investigations; case studies; and Project Based Learning. The essential, common ingredient is that an initial stimulus (the enquiry, design or 'problem') engages and motivates the learner(s) to pursue particular lines of investigation, through which learning is achieved and new knowledge created. The learners, usually working in small groups, are guided through the investigation process by a tutor/facilitator, and are supported by a wide and diverse range of resources including online, paper based and human resources. EBL represents a shift away from passive learning methods, which involve the transmission of knowledge to students, to more facilitative teaching methods through which students are expected to construct their own knowledge and understanding by engaging in supported processes of enquiry, i.e. learning in 'research mode'. The learning is driven by a process of enquiry or investigation. It is student-centred, and requires active participation. It is a supported process that develops a range of skills in students: teamwork; problem solving; academic; research; information; professional; and personal. Crucially, though, Enquiry Based Learning is a social activity, which students and staff enjoy. EBL encompasses familiar active learning environments such as design, problem based learning, field studies, case-based learning, dissertations, projects and research. This highly interactive workshop will explore the concepts of EBL and participants will enjoy a personal experience of EBL. © 2009 Authors.",,"Active learning environment; Case based learning; Diverse range; Engineering disciplines; Enquiry-based learning; Field studies; Gaining momentum; Information literacy; Investigation process; Leadership skills; Learning experiences; Passive learning; Personal experience; Personal skills; Problem based learning; Professional skills; Project based learning; Small groups; Social activities; Student-centred; Teaching and learning; Teaching methods; Undergraduate programmes; Design; Engineering education; Engineers; Learning systems; Problem solving; Professional aspects; Research; Teaching; Students","Barrett, T., Handbook of Enquiry and Problem Based Learning, , AISHE; Ireland; ISBN 10: 0-9551698-0-1; Savin-Baden, M., Wilkie, K., (2006) Challenging Research in Problem Based Learning, , McGraw Hill ISBN 0335220061","Moore, I.; Sheffield Hallam UniversityUnited Kingdom",,,,"English","Eng.

The identification of threshold concepts in engineering may help guide the design of core courses and the approaches used in teaching mastery components. However, the identification of such concepts has proved rather troublesome in itself, with ongoing debate as to value of the construct in real teaching contexts. This study uses frequent student survey to look for the characteristics which may be indicative of threshold concepts; attention is given to some key first year undergraduate-level engineering concepts. A question-set is developed, and electronic handheld voting devices used to regularly quantify the student self-perception of understanding, which is further compared with a test of actual understanding. In addition, a retrospective survey and interview are used together with chronological record of students' self-perceptions and test results to identify transforming instants. Finally, a favourable set of survey questions is proposed for identifying the defining characteristics of potential threshold concepts. © 2009 M. Holloway, E. Alpay, A.

The workshop assignment requires an unconventional use of materials for a design task. The workshop's goal is to explore the limits of the application of materials when applied to a design. The workshop starts with an inspiring introduction in which a designer demonstrates an unusual application of materials. After the introduction, the materials and the assignment are given out, the characteristics of the materials are investigated and the students work on their first ideas and models. Next, like-minded people are put together in groups of three or four students. The groups plan a design using the materials they have been given at a scale of 1:1, and prepare themselves for the fun of building the designs themselves. On day three, the designs are built with simple tools in a large space. Under pressure, the most fantastic structures are created. A jury judges the results and tests the built prototypes. Sometimes, the students need to test their ingenious designs themselves. An example of this is an emergency shelter made by the students, in which the students were expected to sleep for one night during winter.

This paper evaluates the overall performance of students in two engineering courses where self-assessment quizzes were made available through the e-learning system. As formative assessment, it was noted that the frequent attempts by students tend to cluster near the final examination period, however, a few students attempted them as soon as they were released. The results showed there is a strong correlation between students who attempt the quizzes and their overall student performance assessed by final grades.

Whilst considering techniques to retain engineering students it is suggested that understanding how students perceive their learning contexts at university is vital. It is also essential that we understand how these perceptions influence students approaches to their studies. The paper builds on existing research which takes a discipline focus to a discussion of the relationships linking quality of learning with generic research into approaches and perceptions of teaching and learning. This paper discusses an ongoing research project which is making use of a Mixed Methods research methodology to investigate the complex nature of students perceptions and approaches. It is presented here that this methodology is valuable for Engineering Education researchers to adopt. The design of this research is an exploratory sequential mixed methods design where the qualitative data is the dominant source of data. The use of this methodology will be evaluated once all data has been collected and analysed. Initial analysis of the data collected during the pilot phase, supported by relevant literature, has been used to identify the areas of the learning context which appear to influence students approaches on the engineering modules involved in the study.

None of these statements, however, offer any guidance on how these skills might be fostered, let alone assessed. This paper presents findings from the second cycle of an action research project to develop a dedicated creative problem solving module for first year engineering undergraduates. In the module Problem Based Learning (PBL) techniques have been used with Lego Mindstorm NXT robots to develop creative problem solving skills. The focus on the module has been on developing process skills as opposed to the simple methodical solving of routine problems. Process skills have been introduced and mediated by the use of Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs) within a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Separate RLOs have also been used to develop skills at using the robots. The action research cycle has been informed by a parallel project involving interviews considering the perceptions of students, academics and professional engineers to creative problem solving. Phenomenography has been used as the main research tool. Student feedback through on-line questionnaires, focus groups, classroom-based observation and interviews indicates that the module, and its means of delivery, has proven successful in improving creative problem solving skills. It also highlights the value of developing process skills within a practical and motivational environment. © 2010 Jonathan Adams, Stefan Kaczmarczyk, Phil Picton, Peter Demian.",,"Action research; Creative problem-solving; Developing process; First-year engineering; Focus groups; Lego mindstorm; Online questionnaire; Parallel projects; Phenomenography; Policy statements; Problem based learning; Professional engineer; Research tools; Reusable learning object; Student feedback; Virtual learning environments; Engineering education; Engineers; Research; Surveys; Robots","Abra, J., (1997) The Motives for Creative Work, , Creskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Adams, J., (2009) Problem Solving and Creativity in Engineering: Turning Novices into Professionals Transitions 2009, , Northampton, UK; Adams, J., Kaczmarczyk, S., Picton, P., Demian, P., Improving problem solving and encouraging creativity in engineering undergraduates (2007) International Conference on Engineering Education ICEE 2007, , Coimbra, Portugal; Adams, J., Kaczmarczyk, S., Picton, P., Demian, P., Problem solving and creativity in engineering: Findings of interviews with experts and novices (2008) International Conference on Engineering Education ICEE 2008, , Budapest, Hungary; Adams, J., Turner, S., Problem solving and creativity for undergraduate computing and engineering students: The use of robots as a development tool (2008) Creating Contemporary Student Learning Environments 2008, , Northampton, UK; Adams, J., Turner, S., Problem solving and creativity for undergraduate engineers: Process or product?

After a short introductory presentation, participants will be asked to form small groups; they will remain in these groups throughout the workshop activities. Each group will be given three fictitious student profiles and asked to highlight the particular difficulties they believe will be encountered by each student when they first attend lectures on differentiation. Following this, each group will be given the opportunity to choose a variant on the main topic from a given list - for example, the general concept of a derivative, or finding maximum values. Flip charts and some materials will be provided. Each group will be asked to identify methods of teaching, focus on likely difficulties and come up with interesting and novel ways of presenting the material to these students. Finally, each group will disseminate their portfolio of ideas to all participants.

Formerly, the programmes had been traditionally based by breaking the curriculum into a series of modules which were taught linearly over the academic year; many ending in an examination. It was thought that changing the delivery style would benefit student motivation and engagement with a consequent improvement in attainment. Colleagues had undertaken extensive international research to identify best practice from leading institutions around the world. Delivery was redesigned so that students worked in small groups on realistic integrative engineering projects for the first six weeks of their course. The topic for the project work was selected as electronic music since this linked well with the first year curriculum and was known to be an interest for typical first year electrical and electronic students. Fabrication and test of tangible electrical artefacts was required to provide an easily appreciated outcome. The projects were intensively scheduled and supported. Careful observations were made during the project to compare the attitudes of the students with what had previously been the norm. Detailed reflections by all participants were recorded. Quantifiable assessment results were compared on a before and after basis. © 2010 Poole, N., Jinks, R., Bate, S., Oliver, M. and Bland, C.",,"Electronic music; Engineering project; First year; First-year curriculum; International researches; Learning experiences; Learning paradigms; Project work; Small groups; Student motivation; Computer music; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Students","Anderson, E., Peters, C., On the provision of a comprehensive computer graphics education in the context of computer games: An activity-led instruction approach (2009) Proceedings of CGE09; Booth, G., White, P., Innovative curriculum development within the motorsport BEng course at coventry university (2008) Proceedings of EE2008, International Conference on Innovation, Good Practice and Research in Engineering Education, , Loughborough: July 14-16; (2009) Programme Specifications - Faculty of Engineering and Computing, , http://wwwp.coventry.ac.uk/cu/d/919/a/5133, [accessed 6 January 2010]; (2009) The Add+vantage Scheme - Enhancing Your Employability, , Coventry, UK; De Bono, E., (1992) Serious Creativity, , New York: Harper Business; Fry, H., Ketteridge, S., Marshall, S., (2003) A Handbook for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education: Enhancing Academic Practice, , 2 nd edn.

This paper focuses on work-based learning in the context of learning for work, with campus-based learners gaining experience in the workplace, linked to formally accredited Higher Education programmes. In Engineering work-based learning typically involves industrial sandwich placements which may result in an additional award, such as a diploma of industrial studies, but rarely result in credit. In other disciplines such as Health and Medicine, however, there is a long tradition of awarding credit for work-based learning. This paper outlines the context and drivers for awarding credit for work based learning in Engineering and draws on literature, cross-discipline case studies and stakeholder perceptions to describe models of work-based learning and assessment practices appropriate to Engineering. It concludes by reflecting on the practical implications for academic institutions, staff, students and industrial supervisors involved. © 2009 Authors.",,"Academic institutions; Assessment practices; Higher education; Higher education programmes; Learning in engineering; Stakeholder perception; Engineering education; Engineers; Industry; Models","Allin, L., Turnock, C., (2007) Assessing Student Performance in Work-based Learning, , http://www.practicebasedlearning.org/resources/materials/docs/ Assessment%20in%20the%20Work%20Place/index.htm, (accessed September 2008); Brennan, J., Little, B., (1996) A Review of Work Based Learning in Higher Education, Quality Support Centre, , The Open University, UK; Brodie, P., Irving, K., Assessment in work-based learning: Investigating a pedagogical approach to enhance student learning (2007) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 32 (1), pp. 11-19; Costly, C., Work-based learning: Assessment and evaluation in higher education (2007) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 32 (1), pp. 1-9; Garnett, J., (2005) Inaugural Lecture, , Middlesex University, March; Gray, D., (2001) A Briefing on Work-based Learning, , LTSN Generic Centre Learning and Teaching Support Network, Assessment Series No 11, York; Gray, D., (2001) A Briefing on Work-based Learning, , LTSN Generic Centre Learning and Teaching Support Network, Assessment Series No 11, York; Hodgkins, R., Bamforth, S., (2006) Academic Practice Award Final Report: Enhancing Work-based Learning in Geography: An Investigation of the Opportunities, , internal document; Lilley, D., Bamforth, S., (2008) Awarding Credit for Work Based Learning Through Sandwich Placements - Implications for the MEng Degree, , internal document; Little, B., Employability and work-based learning (2004) Employability and Learning Series 7, , ESECT Colleagues The Higher Education Academy; The path to productivity: The progress of work-based-learning strategies in higher education engineering programmes (2007) Partnership With: The Higher Education Academy-engineering Subject Centre and Foundation Degree Forward, , New Engineering Foundation; Code of practice for the assurance of academic quality and standards in higher education, section 9: Work-based and placement learning (2007) Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), , QAA September 2007; (2005) Europe Note E/05/12 the Bologna Process and UKs Integrated Masters Programmes, , UK Europe Unit 11th November 2005","Bamforth, S.; EngCETL and Design and Technology, United Kingdom; email: s.e.bamforth@lboro.ac.uk",,,,"English","Eng.

The paper presents findings from a snapshot review of current approaches. Undertaken in 2009, the review was informed by consultations with UK and international experts and practitioners in engineering education, project-based learning and problem-based learning. It forms part of a wider programme of work at the Bernard M. Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership Program at MIT to promote leadership and project-based learning in the engineering curriculum. The findings suggest that project-based activities are often developed by faculty operating as lone 'champions' with limited time, resources and support. Given these structural constraints, approaches which have been 'tried and tested' elsewhere could provide robust models, particularly initiatives which are well-regarded by the engineering education community. However, evidence from the review indicates that many well-known approaches to project-based learning do not offer readily transferable models, either through catering to low student numbers on relatively high per capita budgets, or through relying on specialist in-house expertise or equipment. Against this background, the paper discusses the key features of successful engineering project-based learning experiences in the UK. A selection of transferable best practice examples currently in operation is presented, that could, potentially, be adopted 'out-of-the-box' at other institutions. The paper concludes by noting the importance of institutional support for the current and future success of project-based learning in the UK engineering curriculum. © 2009 Ruth Graham and Edward Crawley.",,"Engineering curriculum; Engineering leadership; In-line; Institutional support; International experts; Key feature; Per capita; Problem based learning; Programme of work; Project based learning; Project-based; Robust models; Structural constraints; Student numbers; Engineers; Management; Engineering education","Adams, J.P., Turner, S., Problem solving and creativity for undergraduate engineers: Process or product?

A small questionnaire was developed in 2006 to explore the reasons for this spike in enrolments, and to gather information about these students, who mostly study part-time because they work full-time in the engineering industry. The online questionnaire was posted in March 2007 and all of the students enrolled in the program at that time were asked to complete the questionnaire. Since then, the students in each commencing cohort have been invited to complete the questionnaire during their first semester of study. A preliminary analysis of the 247 responses from distance education students found that 63% of the students have a career goal to become a Professional Engineer and see the Associate Degree as a stepping stone to the Bachelor of Engineering. Surprisingly, less than 14% of the respondents intend to pursue a career as an Engineering Associate. This unexpected result challenges a long-held assumption that students in Australian Advanced Diploma and Associate Degree programs will pursue careers as Engineering Technicians. This paper reports on an analysis of the 2007-2009 data and discusses the need for effective and efficient articulation (upgrade) pathways to encourage people employed in the engineering industry to undertake university studies and achieve their career goals. If implemented, the benefits will accrue to students, universities, employers, and the engineering profession. © 2009 Authors.",,"Associate degree; Career goals; Engineering educators; Engineering industries; Engineering profession; Engineering program; Online questionnaire; Preliminary analysis; Professional engineer; Stepping stone; Biographies; Distance education; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Surveys; Professional aspects","(2009) Engineering Associate Stage 1: Units and Elements of Competency, , http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/education/program-accreditation/ program-accreditation.cfm, EA [accessed 8 February 2010]; (2006) Accreditation Criteria Guidelines; Document No. G02, Accreditation Management System, , http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/education/program-accreditation/ program-accreditation.cfm, EA [accessed 8 February 2010]; (2009) Graduate Attributes and Professional Competencies, Version 2, 18th June 2009, , http://www.washingtonaccord.org/, IEA The International Engineering Alliance [accessed 8 February 2010]; (2009) Dublin Accord, the International Engineering Alliance, , http://www.ieagreements.org/Dublin/, IEA [accessed 8 February 2010]; (2009) Rules & Procedures, International Education Accords, , http://www.ieagreements.org/Rules_and_Procedures.pdf, IEA The International Engineering Alliance [accessed 8 February 2010]; (2004) Shared Dublin Descriptors for Short Cycle, First Cycle, Second Cycle and Third Cycle Awards, , http://www.jointquality.nl/, [accessed 8 February 2010]; King, R., (2008) Engineers for the Future: Addressing the Supply and Quality of Australian Engineering Graduates for the 21st Century, , An Australian Learning and Teaching Council funded project, Australian Council of Engineering Deans, Sydney","Dowling, D.; University of Southern QueenslandAustralia; email: dowling@usq.edu.au",,,,"English","Eng.

These approaches often involve the development of new mechanics learning resources in a variety of styles depending on the perceived learning obstacle. As part of a project funded by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council on addressing student learning diversity in engineering mechanics we have developed a framework for reviewing these existing learning resources. This framework has been used to create a database of references to resources, categorising them by attributes such as topics covered and depth of coverage, suitable student learning styles, appropriate learner levels, copyright and accessibility issues. While it is anticipated that academics will use the database to complement their normal subject delivery, it has been developed with student users as the main target audience. Student focus groups have shown that independent study can be ineffective, particularly after hours when assistance is unavailable. The aim of this database is to encourage students to be proactive in improving the quality of their learning by assisting them to select learning resources best suited to their needs, in both content and style of delivery. In this paper we describe the elements of the framework used to review engineering mechanics resources, the resultant database of resources, and the planned evaluation of its effectiveness in improving learning outcomes. The authors intend to demonstrate use of the database at the conference. © 2010 Goldfinch & Gardner.",,"Engineering faculty; Engineering mechanics; Failure rate; First-year engineering; Focus groups; Improving learning; Learning obstacles; Learning resource; Student learning; Target audience; Database systems; Engineering education; Engineers; Mechanics; Students; Engineering","Alpay, E., Ahearn, A.L., Graham, R.H., Bull, A.M.J., Student enthusiasm for engineering: Charting changes in student aspirations and motivation (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (5-6); Bradley, A., (2006) Australian Engineering Competency Standards - Stage 1 Competency Standards for Professional Engineers, , Engineers Australia, Melbourne; Carson, S., The open course ware story: New England roots, global reach (2008) The New England Journal of Higher Education, 23 (1); Chen, H.L., Lattuca, L.R., Hamilton, E.R., Conceptualizing engagement: Contributions of faculty to student engagement in engineering (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3); Felder, R.M., Silverman, L.K., Learning and teaching styles in engineering education (1988) Engineering Education, 78 (7), pp. 674-681; Goldfinch, T., Carew, A., McCarthy, T., Improving learning in engineering mechanics: The significance of understanding (2008) 19th Annual Conference for the Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , 7-10 December, Yeppoon Australia; Goldfinch, T., Carew, A., Thomas, G., Students views on engineering mechanics education and the implications for educators (2009) 20th Annual Conference for the Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , 6-9 December, Adelaide Australia; Hadgraft, R., It's time for a coordinated approach to computer-aided learning and assessment (2007) 18th Annual Conference for the Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , 2-5 December, Melbourne Australia; Hadgraft, R., (2009) Eng Mechanics, , http://aaee-scholar.pbworks.com/Eng-mechanics, [Accessed 29th January 2010]; Litzinger, T., Lee, S.H., Wise, J.C., Felder, R.M., A psychometric study of the index of learning styles (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (4); Rezaei, A., Jawaharlal, M., Kim, K.J., Shih, A., Development of a hybrid vector statics course to reduce failure rate (2007) 114 th Annual American Society for Engineering Education Conference, , 24-27 June, Honolulu USA; Steif, P., Dollár, A., Study of usage patterns and learning gains in a web-based interactive static course (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (4); Thomas, G., Henderson, A., Goldfinch, T., The influence of university entry scores on performance in engineering mechanics (2009) 20th Annual Conference for the Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , 6-9 December, Adelaide Australia","Goldfinch, T.; University of WollongongAustralia; email: tom_goldfinch@uow.edu.au",,,,"English","Eng.

For new students, early assimilation and engagement are seen as key to successful study. Previous teaching innovations involving 'problem-based' methods were employed in the Automotive Engineering Design course in the early 1990's and much of the ethos and activities supporting it have remained embedded in the course and also practiced more widely in allied courses. This approach was developed and packaged into a six-week introductory Activity-Led-Learning (ALL) programme. 100 first year students from courses in Mechanical Engineering, Automotive Engineering and Automotive Engineering Design, organised into six groups, underwent a series of six Monday - Friday exercises, each assessed on completion. A team of 16 staff delivered the programme which accounted for 18 hours (of 27-29) on the student timetable. A subsequent student survey demonstrated a net improvement in satisfaction compared to a 2006/7 survey, and particular acclaim for 'activity', 'group work', and 'teaching methodology'. Indeed, 74% of student indicated a preference for more of this kind of learning. The exercises formed the major part of a core module for which the pass rate at first exam board was 96% (78% the previous year). Subsequently, student progression to stage 2 was 76% (72% previous year). Staff identified 'enthusiasm for competitive elements' and 'attendance patterns' as notable aspects of behavioural engagement. The results will guide the application of the ALL approach across the Faculty.","Activity led learning; Engagement; Engineering; Learning; Retention","Coventries; Engagement; Engineering design course; First year students; Group work; Learning; Pass rate; Previous year; Problem-based; Retention; Student engagement; Student satisfaction; Student surveys; Teaching methodologies; Automotive engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Innovation; Surveys; Teaching; Students","(2003) Issue Paper: Understanding Student Satisfaction, , http://admin.selkirk.bc.ca/research/documents/issue_satisfaction%5B1%5D. pdf, BC College & Institute Student Outcomes ISSN 1492-3718; Biggs, J., (1999) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , SRHE and Open University Press, Buckingham; Chapman, E., (2003) ""Assessing Student Engagement Rates"" ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation, , http://www.ericdigests.org/2005-2/engagement.html, ERIC identifier: ED482269; Wilson-Medhurst, S., Towards sustainable activity led learning innovations in teaching, learning and assessment (2008) EE2008 - The International Conference on Innovation, Good Practice and Research in Engineering Education Conference Proceedings, , ISBN 978 1 904804 65 9.

In order to meet such challenges there needs to be a supply of engineering talent able to turn its collective mind to what is required. Yet at a time when demands for engineers able to provide innovative solutions to contemporary problems is possibly at its highest, the profession is plagued by shortages and an inability to attract young people (DIUS, 2008; RAE 2008; NSF, 2009). Although the current situation appears critical, potential future shortages of engineers means that unless action is taken urgently, matters will get worse during the next 20 to 30 years. For higher education, the challenge is how to change young peoples perceptions of engineering in such a manner that it is seen as a worthwhile and rewarding career. This paper considers this challenge, looking in detail at why young people fail to view engineering positively. A theoretical framework outlining the various real-life barriers and drivers is proposed. A critical analysis of current policy and practice suggests that in order to promote engineering as a profession that young people want to enter, both pedagogic and policy grounded solutions need to be found. By bringing together pedagogy and policy within an engineering framework the paper adds to current debates in engineering education whilst providing a distinctive look at what seems to be a recurring problem. © 2009 Authors.",,"Critical analysis; Current situation; Engineering frameworks; Engineering talent; Higher education; Innovative solutions; Perceptions of engineering; Theoretical framework; Electric grounding; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects","(2009) Graduate Recruitment Survey 2009, , http://www.agr.org.uk/Content/Launch-of-the-AGR-Graduate-Recruitment- Survey-2009-Summer-Review, Accessed 21st October 2009; (2009) Engineering - Go for It!, , http://egfi-k12.org/, ASEE American Society for Engineering Education Accessed 20 th October 2009; Astahana, A., (2008) They Dont Live for Work.

Many of the tools developed previously have been transitory, only existing for the period in which they were funded or failed to be transferable, only adopted by the host institution. Funded e-learning tools are usually expected to have a sustainability plan to ensure ongoing support and adoption, past the life time of the funding, however in practice this is hard to deliver once funding has ended and staff have left. This paper will look at a number of issues which can affect transferability and sustainability including:. why academics pilot such tools in the engineering discipline?. what consideration is given to sustainability when adopting a new tool or system?. who are the key stakeholders for these resources and why?. what factors can encourage a community of users to develop and stay engaged?. how can the community of users assist with ongoing sustainability? Particular attention will be given to the experiences and the lessons learnt by the WebPA team in trying to build a community of users, both academic and support staff, around the tool in the search for a sustainable future. By examining the user groups which have developed around the open source WebPA tool the paper will highlight what does and does not work in developing a sustainable community within engineering academia. © 2009 Authors.",,"E-learning tool; Engineering disciplines; Engineering educators; Life-times; Open sources; Support staff; Sustainable communities; Teaching practices; User groups; E-learning; Engineering education; Engineers; Sustainable development; Engineering","Bacon, J., (2009) The Art of Community: Building the New Age of Participation, , http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/downloads/jonobacon- theartofcommunity-1ed.pdf, O'Reilly Media, Inc.

It addresses an issue that has recently been identified by the researchers where students on an Engineering programme were not recognising the presence of feedback on their assessed work. Feedback is central to the process of learning. However it has been widely accepted, through tools such as the UK National Student Survey, that students are still relatively dissatisfied with the feedback they have received. There is therefore a need to ensure that feedback given to students is specific and constructive in terms of helping them move their own learning forward. A pilot is being carried out with two Engineering classes, offering students the option to request specific feedback on their class tests. The students are asked to identify the areas of their work they require feedback on through the completion of a feedback request label. Staff can then respond to the feedback requests and issue students with personal and relevant feedback. Initial findings from the project have shown students to have clear expectations regarding the type of feedback they want. Students identified that they expect clear and legible feedback, which draws together feedback comments from throughout their work and provides a summary of how they could move forwards. Findings have also identified some differences in expectations and perceptions of feedback between the Level 3 and Level 4 students involved in the project. © 2009 Authors.",,"Constructive feedback; Engaging students; Engineering class; Feedback to students; Level 4; Relevant feedback; Student surveys; Engineering education; Engineers; Teaching; Students","Allin, A., Fishwick, L., Subject specific guide: Engaging sport students in assessment and formative feedback (2009) The Higher Education Academy Network for Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism, , http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/hlst/documents/resources/ ssg_allin_assessment_feedback.pdf, [Accessed 23 Jan 2010]; Attwood, R., Radnofsky, L., (2007) Satisfied but Students Want More Feedback, , http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode= 310440&sectioncode=26, 14 Sept.

In addition to mathematics sessions, the programme included an emphasis on key skills workshops, group work, evening social activities and an introduction to the Mathematics Learning Support Centre (MLSC) and its facilities. The MLSC, open to everyone at Loughborough University, has a wealth of mathematics support material and offers one-to-one mathematics support, which is available on a drop-in basis. Due to the success of the first 'Flying Start', the pre-sessional school ran annually for four years and intake was widened to include students, who met the criteria, from engineering or engineering related disciplines. Following the first three summer schools, attendees who scored less than 50% on a mathematics diagnostic test, were also offered additional individual support with their mathematics modules during their first year of study. This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal study tracking retention rates and degree classification of students who attended the 2003 and 2004 Flying Start. These results are compared to those obtained by non 'Flying Start' attendees who entered the same department in the Engineering Faculty in 2004. Conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the mathematics support offered to students who enter university with a weak mathematical background. © 2009 Perkin, G, Bamforth, S.E. and Robinson, C.L.","Engineering education; Higher education; Mathematics support; Progression; Retention","Diagnostic tests; Engineering faculty; First year; Group work; Higher education; Longitudinal study; Loughborough University; Mathematics learning; Non-traditional; Progression; Retention; Retention rate; Social activities; Summer school; Support materials; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Mathematical techniques","Bamforth, S.E., Robinson, C.L., Croft, A.C., Crawford, A.R., Retention and progression of engineering students with diverse mathematical backgrounds (2007) Teaching Mathematics and its Applications, pp. 156-166. , 26th April 2007; Croft, T., (2009) Measuring the Effectiveness of Mathematics Support Centres, , http://www.sigma-cetl.ac.uk/index.php?section=76, [accessed 27 January 2010]; (1995) Tackling the Mathematics Problem, , LMS., IMA., & RSS London Mathematical Society, London, UK; Mustoe, L., Papering over the cracks?

The ability to maintain and enhance student motivation is therefore one of the most important skills for HE lecturers, and many publications and training programmes devote considerable space and time to this matter. Applying this theoretical knowledge in practice, however, remains difficult due to the complexity of the concept and the number of different models of motivation available. Furthermore practical aspects, such as large size of many classes make it difficult for lecturers to identify the areas and level of interests of their students. This project aimed at addressing these two difficulties: by developing a motivation profile of a large student cohort of a core engineering module (SCQF level 9) at Glasgow Caledonian it provided the basis for changes in learning and teaching activities aimed at enhancing student learning on this module. At the same time it examined whether two popular theories of motivation, included in a number of relevant publication and programmes in teaching and learning in Higher Education, can be successfully applied to a student population. Vrooms expectancy model (1964 in McKenna 2003) and Herzbergs distinction between hygiene and motivation factors, originated in studies on the workplace. Their applicability to HE students could thus be questioned. The results, obtained through two questionnaires based on these models, suggest that expectancy theory is relevant to students learning experience and that greater transparency about the future valence of course contents can raise their motivation. Differences between hygiene and motivation factors, on the other hand, were less clearly visible. © 2010 Jonathan Adams, Stefan Kaczmarczyk, Phil Picton, Peter Demian.",,"Core engineering; Course contents; Enhancing student learning; Expectancy theory; Higher education; Large groups; Large sizes; Level Of Interest; Motivation factors; Space and time; Student motivation; Student populations; Students learning; Teaching and learning; Theories of learning; Training programmes; Core levels; Engineering education; Engineers; Group theory; Motivation; Surveys; Teaching; Students","Biggs, J., Tang, C., (2007) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Maidenhead: McGraw Hill; Bye, D., Pushkar, D., Conway, M., Motivation, interest and positive affect in traditional and nontraditional undergraduate students (2007) Adult Education Quarterly, 57, pp. 141-158; Bransford, J.D., Brown, A.L., Cocking, R.R., (1999) How People Learn.

The ultimate goal is to graduate better engineers and more engaged citizens and to improve communities, i.e., to engineer the common good. Four of the degree programs have achieved on average one course each semester, with an actual coverage of 103 out of 128 semester courses, or 80% coverage. Of the 32 required courses in the academic year that had an average of 753 students each semester doing S-L projects related to the subject matter of the course, 19 of the courses (60%) were considered engineering science, that is, not explicitly design or first-year introduction courses. More than fifty courses having S-L components have been offered under the program. Over two-thirds of the students and faculty members expressed agreement with the basic idea of SLICE, with about 15% opposed. Twentythree percent of entering students cite S-L as one of the reasons for enrolling in engineering at UML, and more than two-thirds of the students reported that S-L helped keep them in engineering. The program represents perhaps the largest experiment with S-L in mainstream engineering courses in terms of courses, students, and faculty. This approach included an inquiry addressing a number of programmatic and research questions, which are posited and ""tested"" with quantitative and qualitative data.",,"Degree program; Engineering course; Engineering science; Faculty members; First-year; Qualitative data; Research questions; Semester course; Service learning; Subject matters; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Teaching; Technical presentations; Students","Abes, E.S., Jackson, G., Jones, S., Factors that motivate and deter faculty use of service-learning (2002) Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning, 9 (1), pp. 5-17; (2009) Criteria for accreditating engineering programs-Effective for evaluations during the 2009-2010 accreditation cycle, , http://abet.org, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology [ABET].

This evolution has broadened the field of ECE, and subfields have seen deep penetration into very specialized areas. Remarkable devices and systems arising from innovative processes, exotic materials, high speed computer simulations, and complex algorithms make ECE an exciting career field. These fascinating developments present greater opportunities for undergraduates to explore the field of ECE as well as greater challenges for them to navigate the curriculum because of the myriad of course and areas of concentration choices they have to make. Reflecting innovations in the field and capitalizing on the collective faculty research expertise, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University has redesigned its undergraduate curriculum around the theme of Integrated Sensing and Information Processing. This paper presents details of the ECE curriculum redesign at Duke University including its philosophy and implementation as well as elements of the redesign that are transferable to other universities. Evidence of increased student ability to design a system or component and to work effectively in teams is presented through statistical analyses of student end-of-course course evaluations. Student design project complexity evolution as the curriculum redesign unfolded is also presented, and this provides further evidence that design and teamwork have enhanced student learning throughout the new curriculum.","Department level reform; Integrated sensing and information processing; Theme-based curriculum redesign","Complex algorithms; Course evaluations; Deep penetration; Department level reform; Devices and systems; Duke University; Electrical and computer engineering; Electrical and computer engineering curriculums; Exotic materials; High speed computer simulation; Innovative process; Integrated sensing and information processing; Student design projects; Student learning; Subfields; Theme-based curriculum redesign; Undergraduate curricula; Computer simulation; Data processing; Design; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Innovation; Integration; Students; Teaching; Curricula","Olds, B., Miller, R., The Effect of a First-Year Integrated Engineering Curriculum on Graduation Rates and Student Satisfaction: A Longitudinal Study (2004) J.

The overall goal of the reform has been to have students learn and apply a systems approach to engineering problem solving such that when they become practicing engineers they will develop more sustainable engineering solutions. We have integrated systems thinking into our programs in the following ways; 1) new material has been included in key courses (e.g., the first-year introductory and senior design courses), 2) a sequence of three related environmental and transportation systems courses have been included within the curricula (i.e., Introduction to Systems, Decision Making, and Modeling), and 3) service-learning (SL) projects have been integrated into key required courses as a way of practicing a systems approach. A variety of assessment methods were implemented as part of the reform including student surveys, student focus groups, faculty interviews, and assessment of student work. Student work in five classes demonstrate that students are learning the systems approach, applying it to engineering problem solving, and that this approach helps meet ABET outcomes. Initial student resistance to changing the curriculum has decreased post implementation (e.g., graduating class 2010), and many students are able to define and apply the concept of sustainability in senior design project. Student self-assessments show support of SL projects and that the program is influencing student understanding of the roles and responsibilities of engineers in society.","Assessment; Civil engineering; Environmental engineering; Service learning; Sustainability; Systems approach; Undergraduate engineering education","ABET outcomes; Assessment; Assessment methods; Course redesign; Engineering problem solving; First-year; Focus groups; Inquiry-based learning; Integrated systems; Integrating systems; Post-implementation; Practicing engineers; Roles and responsibilities; Senior design; Senior Design project; Service learning; Service learning project; Student surveys; Sustainable engineering; Systems approach; Transportation system; Undergraduate engineering educations; Civil engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Environmental engineering; Integrated control; Materials handling; Problem solving; Rating; Sustainable development; System theory; Teaching; Transportation; Students","Adams, R.S., Felder, R.M., Reframing professional development: a systems approach to preparing engineering educators to educate tomorrow's engineers (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, , Guest Editorial.

Numerous reports have recommended federal support to advance our understanding of how students learn, how faculty teach, and how teaching and learning are assessed. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) funded eight Engineering Education Coalitions comprising 49 universities from 1990 to 2005 to encourage implementation of report findings. The NSF Department Level Reform (DLR) program was designed to build on the efforts of the coalitions with funding provided to 20 universities to reformulate and update their engineering programs from 2004-2008.

Furthermore, the curriculum encourages a global-minded entrepreneurship approach as well as reports and presentations associated with learning activities. The Electrical Engineering program begins by emphasizing the importance of recognizing how one learns and what one's preferred styles are, as well as the convergence and reinforcement of the classical domains of learning in active learning. In teaching this program we draw from affective, psychomotor, and cognitive self awareness to emphasize ethics, professionalism and engineering practices, creativity, acceptance of globalization, and consideration of social and environmental issues as part of a life-long learning career.

This DLR project laid the foundation of sponsored research in engineering education in the Department of Engineering Education. The DLR investigators adopted a spiral curriculum approach to reformulate curricula in general engineering (also called freshman engineering) and bioprocess engineering programs. The spiral curriculum concept recognizes the inherently recursive nature of learning. During this recursive process, students elaborate and strengthen earlier learning, correct misconceptions, develop a more holistic picture of their discipline, and become increasingly self-sufficient as learners. This paper documents the step-wise process that we developed and implemented to rewrite the bioprocess engineering curriculum using spiral theory. Specific examples of learning modules from bioprocess and general engineering are discussed. Assessment approaches and results are presented to highlight the usefulness of such efforts. Adaptation of our spiral curriculum efforts by faculty in other engineering programs to develop a nanotechnology option and ethics spirals is described. We describe lessons learned in three Keywords (i) Patience - Reformulation results may take time to show up, (ii) Diligence - Assessment results are powerful, take these seriously, and (iii) Awareness - Students' perceptions may be difficult to interpret.

The Chemical Engineering Pillars curriculum at the University of Pittsburgh, unique for its use of block scheduling, is one of the first four-year, integrated curricula in engineering, and is specifically designed to facilitate knowledge integration. As this curriculum is one of the first of its kind, conventional assessment strategies are not necessarily well suited for evaluation. In fact, our assessment strategy - by necessity - includes two separate measurement goals. First, we focus on measuring the effectiveness of the new curricular structure for enhancing the ability of students to engage in systems thinking (knowledge integration). At the same time, we specifically assess the impact of this type of curriculum on students' performance in conceptualizing (chemical) engineering principles. The goal of this paper is to outline an overall assessment structure suitable for measuring the efficacy of multi-year integrated curricula. Specifically, we describe the currently available assessment vehicles under use as well as discuss the methods - and results - for building the additional assessment materials required for a thorough vetting of this type of (chemical engineering) curriculum. While our specific assessment is still ongoing, we include a portion of the results to date and discuss their implications for the portability of integrated curricula in chemical engineering.","Assessment; Chemical engineering; Integrated curricula","Assessment; Block scheduling; Curricular structure; Engineering principles; Evaluation strategies; Knowledge integration; Systems thinking; University of Pittsburgh; Chemical engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Integration; Rating; Engineering education","(1995) Engineering Education: Designing an Adaptive System, , National Reseach Council.

The survey was done on the students that participated in the Shell Eco Marathon which was first organized in Malaysia and in Asia region. The objective is to find out whether the students have acquired creativity, self confidence, team work, good management and good communication through project and how the students work in team in achieving the goals of the project. This brief analysis of the survey has shown that the response of the students on quality of good management, good communication and teamwork. There is some indication that project outdoor sports activities have create effective way to poster good management and communication among the team. However, on creativity and innovative thinking, the students have not acquired full creativity and innovative idea on transferring the academic knowledge applied into the project. The hard working effort has created integration among some races Malays and Chinese but the participation of Indian need to be improved. Various qualities, such as cooperation, the self confidence, yearning to be the champion and good leadership were discovered. The hard working effort and high commitment has been shown by the students to work together and having good leadership, good management and good communication. The creativity of the group is still need improvement. This survey has also shown that the project generates healthy understanding amongst students, for integration and exchanges of views for environmental conservation and future sustainable of human life in this region as well as in the whole world. The result of the survey clearly support the positive thinking of the students to demonstrate the good management and good communication amongst the group member and that what takes them to be successful in real life. © 2010 IEEE.","creativity; good management; outdoor international project; Shell-eco marathon competition; student quality; student teamwork","creativity; good management; International projects; Shell-eco marathon competition; student quality; Communication; Conservation; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Planning; Surveys; Sustainable development; Technical presentations; Students","Koenraad, J.L., John, K., Predictability of sport participation motivation from metamotivational dominances and orientations (2001) Personality and Individual Differences, 30, pp. 759-773. , 2001; Barbara, E., Murray, D.S., Modelling the participation decision and duration of sporting activity in Scotland (2010) Economic Modelling, 27, pp. 822-834. , 2010; Darling, N., Caldwell, L.J., Smith, R., Participation in schoolbased extracurricular activities and adolescent adjustment (2005) Journal of Leisure Research, 37 (1), pp. 51-56; Eccles, J.S., Barber, B.L., Student council, volunteering, basketball, or marching band: What kind of extracurricular involvement matters?

EEG data were recorded from 30 students from Faculty of Electrical Engineering, UiTM age 18 to 27 years old. Students were interviewed before EEG recording to find out their music preference. Using EEG, the brainwave signal of the sample is captured twice, once before listening to the music and while listening to the music. Consequently, the brainwave's signal is analyzed and the comparison between these two music genres is discussed. The results demonstrate that 60-80% of the samples show improvement in the alpha band after listening to nasyid while only 56-66% improves after listening to rock music. These findings indicate that the alpha power increases when listening to the nasyid music compare to the rock music.

Developed heuristics evaluations of related multimedia based application were thoroughly analyzed based on specific criteria being used in the heuristics. As a conclusion, Heuristics Evaluation for Courseware (HECW) was proposed to be developed because of the important elements of courseware that need to be addressed in order to develop a usable and acceptable courseware. The development process of HECW involved five major steps; initial study, proposed heuristics, experts review, evaluation process and final heuristics. The discussions of this paper only focus on the fourth step which is evaluation process on HECW.

The asynchronous paradigm has become an interesting alternative. Unfortunately, the topic of asynchronous circuits has been ignored in most university courses. An important step in the synthesis of asynchronous controllers is the logic minimization. Several algorithms were proposed, some of them are not available to students and usually they are complex to apply manually. In this paper we propose a simple method to perform logic minimization starting from XBM controllers. The simplicity of the method and its optimization capacity permit the students to apply it manually in any moment of a digital basic course. © 2010 IEEE.","Finite state machine; hazard logic; Logic minimization; Logic synthesis; XBM specification","Asynchronous circuits; Asynchronous controllers; Basic course; Deep sub-micron; Digital design course; Logic minimization; Logic synthesis; SIMPLE method; Synchronous digital system; University course; VLSI technology; XBM specification; Asynchronous sequential logic; Controllers; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Finite automata; Logic circuits; Students; Technical presentations; E-learning","Yuan, J.S., Kuang, W., Teaching asynchronous design in digital integrated circuits (2004) IEEE Trans on Education, 47 (3), pp. 397-404. , August; Sutherland, I.E., Ebergen, J., Computers without clocks (2002) Sci.

In addition, this paper also addresses lecturers' and students' perceptions on the integration of these skills in the teaching and learning of technical courses in order to find out whether there is any significant difference in their perceptions. The methods used to obtain the data were survey questionnaires and interviews. The results indicate that critical thinking and problem solving skills is placed as most important soft skills by the lecturers and the final year students and is being integrated in the teaching by employing problem-based learning approach, project oriented problem-based approach and project-based approach. The results also reveal that there is no congruence between the lecturers and students in the way they perceived the integration of critical thinking and problem solving skills in the teaching of technical courses. The results are then further discussed. © 2010 IEEE.","critical thinking skills; problem solving skills; teaching; technical courses","Critical thinking; Critical thinking skills; Malaysians; problem solving skills; Problem-based; Problem-based learning approaches; Project-based; Soft skills; Teaching and learning; Teaching approaches; Technical course; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Integration; Personnel training; Problem solving; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Technical presentations","Shuman, L.J., ""ABET ""professional skills""-Can they be taught?

However, student learning of basic and advanced electromagnetic and antenna are difficult because the fundamental quantities are based on abstract mathematics describing fields and waves which are hard to visualize. The existing system of conventional undergraduate teaching provides little practical experiences through laboratory exercises and direct visualization of electromagnetic fields is not possible. Thus, students have difficulty visualizing the related phenomena in electromagnetic and antenna. Consequently, their understanding and ability to be creative in problem solving in these technical areas will be affected. The use of computer technology for visualization of electromagnetic and antenna phenomena is one of the best vehicles to overcome these difficulties. Hence, a visualization and learning aid software package is recently developed by the authors for educational as well as research purposes. This paper discuss a visualization and learning aid software package for electromagnetic theory and antenna that has been developed to allow for two-dimensional and two-dimensional visualization of the electromagnetic (EM) fields and radiation patterns for different types of antennas. © 2010 IEEE.","antenna theory; Electromagnetic theory learning","Antenna theory; Basic concepts; Computer technology; Direct visualization; Electrical engineering students; Electromagnetic theories; Existing systems; Laboratory exercise; Learning aid; Practical experience; Student learning; Undergraduate teaching; Wireless technologies; Directional patterns (antenna); Electric fields; Electrical engineering; Electromagnetic fields; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Software design; Software packages; Students; Technical presentations; Two dimensional; Visualization; Wireless telecommunication systems; Antennas","Sevgi, L., Goknar, I.C., An intelligent balance in engineering education (2004) IEEE Potentials Magazine, 23 (4), pp. 40-41; Sevgi, L., Ulusk, C., A MATLAB-based visualization package for planar arrays of isotropic radiators (2005) IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, 47 (1), pp. 156-163. , DOI 10.1109/MAP.2005.1436259; Sevgi, L., A new electromagnetic engineering program and teaching via virtual tools (2008) Progress in Electromagnetic Research B (P1ERB), 6, pp. 205-224; Cheng, D.K., (1989) Field and Wave Electromagnetics, , 2nd ed.

Although constant implementation of various approaches are made to enhance students' oral competency in English, these conventional teaching methods merely throws a problem for students to discuss. As a result, students participate in speaking programmes just to perform well in exams. In this study, efforts are made to look at the significance of incorporating Six Thinking Hats (STH) in Problem Based Learning (PBL) as the means of getting students to talk on matters that they feel strongly about. Through PBL, students are urged to explore and talk on a shared problem prevalent in their own study environment. STH is used to encourage engineering students to discuss from various perspectives. The aims of this research are to determine how STH through PBL i) assists students in developing better speaking skills and ii) improves students' participation performance in inter-group discussions. The subjects involved 79 electrical engineering undergraduates. The t-test findings from the survey favoured the use of STH approach. Students perceived this learning process to be interesting and engaging. They felt more involved to speak on their own problem from different perspectives. © 2010 IEEE.","Communication Skills; Group Discussions; Problem Based Learning; Six Thinking Hats; Speaking Skills; Student Centred Learning","Communication skills; Group discussions; Problem based learning; Six Thinking Hats; Speaking Skills; Student Centred Learning; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects; Teaching; Technical presentations; Students","Mustapa not happy with English programmes at varsities (2008) The Star Online, , http://thestar.com.myInewsistory.asp?file=/2008/1123/nationl20089328& sec=nation, January 23.

It starts with the assignment of a coordinator and establishing related committees. A schedule which includes all the important deadlines is prepared by the coordinator and distributed to the supervisors as well as students. All regulations are announced to the students during the first meeting and the guidelines are circulated among the supervisors. Workshops for technical writing and presentation skills are held to expose the students to the proper writing and presentation skills. Logbooks are written by students based on the format given and should be approved by their supervisors and will finally be audited by the coordinator monthly to observe their progress. This approach is expected to be beneficial for the management of FYP 2 in terms of organization which consequently leads to the betterment of the students. © 2010 IEEE.","Final Year Project 2; Logbooks; Presentation Skills; Soft Skills; Technical Writing","Evaluation scheme; Final Year Project 2; Logbooks; Presentation skills; Program outcomes; Soft skills; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Personnel training; Supervisory personnel; Technical presentations; Technical writing; Students","Jawitz, J., Management and assessment of final year projects in engineering (2002) Int. 1.

Active learning, wherein the learners are involved in and engaged with the content to be studied is imperative for such an enhanced teaching-learning process. In this context, the role of the teacher changes to that of a facilitator, wherein he/she facilitates the process by which the learner acquires knowledge. Facilitation skills hence become the crucial aspect in the active learning paradigm. This paper brings out the key elements of such a facilitation process, specifically in the context of engineering education.

Universities are accountable in providing adequate communication skills for graduates to prepare them to face the challenging and changing industry. This study investigates the communication skills (oral and written) of interns from a private engineering and technology focused university in Malaysia. For a more comprehensive perspective, two sets of questionnaires are used to gather data from the interns and their respective industrial supervisors. Overall, the findings indicate that the interns possess high communicative abilities both in oral and written. Although the mean scores suggest that the interns had rated their communicative abilities higher than their industrial supervisors, t-test results show no significant difference between the two groups of respondents. Interestingly, no significant difference is found between interns from different academic programmes. The findings of this study indicate that the university may have prepared and groomed its students adequately to meet the needs of the current industries. Explanations for the findings are discussed in relation to the university's intake requirements, course syllabus, and university-industry collaborative initiatives. © 2010 IEEE.","communication skills; industrial supervisors; internship; oral communication skills; written communication skills","Communication skills; industrial supervisors; internship; Oral communication skills; Written communication skills; Communication; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Supervisory personnel; Surveys; Technical presentations; Industry","Kamsah, M.Z., Developing generic skills in classroom environment: Engineering students' perspective (2004) Proceedings of Conference on Engineering Education, , Kuala Lumpur, 14-15 December, 2004; Hii, C., Soft skills essential for success in today's workplace (2007) Sunday Star, pp. N12. , Sept. 23; Sibat, M.P., (2005) Leaping out of the Unemployment Line, , http://www.calm.unimas.my/insite6/article_a.html; Gewertz, C., Soft skills' in big demand (2007) Education Week, 26 (40), pp. 25-27; Hariati, A., The jobs are out there (2009) The Star, pp. F19-F20. , July 5; Raybould, J., Sheedy, V., Are graduates equipped with the right skills in the employability stakes?

The fuzzy control algorithm for light tracking system is implemented using a webcamera as a vision sensor, two PC sound cards as output signal controller, and two DC motors as a pan-tilt driver mechanism. Two Fuzzy logic controllers are designed to control the camera panel angles of the proposed light tracking system. The fuzzy controller input parameters (light source pixel coordinate) and output parameters (variation of duty cycle) are used to generate the optimal pulse-width-modulated (PWM) under different operating conditions to drive the motors. The motors will react accordingly when they receive signal from the sound card to make sure the camera always focuses on the centroid of the light source. The major issues addressed in this paper are reducing the number of pulses that are sending through sound cards to move the motors, this will significantly reduce the power consumption required to drive the camera panel to the desired location. Also using a webcamera and a sound card reduces the circuitry required when compared with conventional light tracking systems, hence, saving components such as xPC target, Encoder, Tachometer, ADC or DCA and others. The system tested at different locations. The data which were obtained by experiment were able to show a validity of the proposed controller. © 2010 IEEE.","DC motor; duty cycle; fuzzification; Image processing; PWM; Sound card; vision sensor; webcamera","duty cycle; Fuzzifications; Sound card; vision sensor; webcamera; Algorithms; Cameras; Controllers; Counting circuits; DC motors; DC power transmission; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Image processing; Light sources; Navigation; Sensors; Technical presentations; Target tracking","Kalogirou, S., Metaxiotis, K., Mellit, A., Artifcial intelligence techniques for modern energy applications (2010) IGI Global; Khan, M.F., Ali, R.L., (2009) Seminarprojects, , http://www.seminarprojects.comIThreadautomatic-sun-tracking-system-asts, Nov.

It is revealed that the alpha band relative power values reduced when the IQ test session is held and it is found that the Index 6 from the IQ group produced highest response of alpha and theta mean power comparing to other IQ Indexes.

An initiative has been taken to provide some guidelines for curriculum designer, in order to design an engineering education curriculum, which is using PBL as a main pedagogical method. Since the monitoring and assessment strategy is one of the critical components that determine the success of PBL implementation, a review has been conducted which focuses on this aspect, in order to identify the specific key factors that contribute to a success of the PBL monitoring and assessment system. Then, these key factors are used to develop a novel PBL monitoring and assessment model for engineering education, specifically for technical skills programmes. Within this, several exemplary best practices have been identified, an approach such as the uses of rubric rating scale with emphasis on self-assessment process, and the strategy to assess two different areas of assessing personal skills and technical skills, appear as a key condition in creating competence graduates. © 2010 IEEE.","monitoring and assessment; Problem based learning; rubric; technical skills","Critical component; Key factors; Monitoring and assessment; Pedagogical method; Personal skills; Problem based learning; Rating scale; rubric; Self-assessment; Technical skills; Curricula; Engineering; Engineers; Monitoring; Rating; Technical presentations; Engineering education","Kolmos, A., (2007) Problem Based Learning, B5. , http://www3.unifi.it/tree/dl/oc/b5.pdf, Avalible at; Savin-Baden, M., Understanding the impact of assessment on students in problem-based learning (2004) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 41 (2), pp. 223-233; Sulaiman, A.H., Results of the asia link project: Problem-oriented project based learning in environmental management and technology (2007) Asia Link Symposium, , Kuala Lumpur, 7 September; Moesby, E., Curriculum Development for Project-Oriented and Problem-Based Learning (POPBL) with Emphasis on Personal Skills and Abilities (2005) Global Journal of Engineering Education, 9 (2), pp. 121-128; Barrows, H.S., Tamblyn, R., (1980) Problem-Based Learning: An Approach to Medical Education, , 1st ed., New York: Springer Publishing; Brodie, L., Gibbings, P., Developing problem based learning communities in virtual space connected (2007) 2007 International Conference on Design Education, pp. 1-4. , Sydney: University of New South Wales; Woods, D.R., Problem-based learning for large classes in chemical engineering (1996) New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 68, pp. 91-99; Woods, D.R., Helping your student gain the most from PBL (2000) Proceeding of Second Asia-Pacific Conference on PBL, , http://chemeng.mcmaster.ca/pbl/Singapore.pdf, Singapore, 1-22, Retrieved December 14, 2009, from; Helerea, E., Matoi, A., Oltean, I., Munteanu, A., Problem based learning applied to electrical engineering (2008) International Conference on Engineering Education.

By taking into account, that learners' learning style is crucial in succeeding the learning process and the importance of brain as The Organ of Learning, we believe that the brain's fingerprint should be put under the research radar in order to discover the reciprocal relation between both entities. In this research, we used electroencephalography (EEG) technology to record a brain signal of our participants (N=41) at resting baseline state of Eyes-Open and Eyes-Closed. Prior to that, we deployed the Kolb's Learning Style Inventory to conduct a learning style classification onto them.

This paper describes the development of a database system to enable the monitoring of the quality of Malaysian engineers throughout the years. The system was built for the Institution of Engineers Malaysia (IEM) to enable IEM to assess and track failure trend of interviewees of the Professional Interview (PI). The scope of the project presented herewith includes collection of data from 1980 until 2009. Data collected includes the candidates' profile such as gender, local or overseas graduate, reasons of failure etc. The system was created to enable IEM to observe, for example, the difference in gender performance during the PI and to track which part of the PI that most candidates fails. Included in this paper are the preliminary results from analysis of the data.

We present both traditional LO as well as the fuzzy LO evaluation methods. We discuss both methods using student assessment marks and conclude on the possibility of employing fuzzy LO evaluation. We also compare the LO variation in evaluations of fuzzy method to traditional method using mean square error and find that to be small. Fuzzy method offers instructors the flexibility to modify the input assessment and output LO relationships, easier to set target outcome based on combination of these relationships and the process is akin to the human's reasoning. © 2010 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Learning outcome evaluation","Evaluation Method; Fuzzy application; Fuzzy methods; Learning outcome; Outcome-based education; Student assessment; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Rating; Technical presentations; Fuzzy logic","Spady, W.G., Organizing for results: The basis of authentic restructuring and reform (1988) Educational Leadership, 46 (2), pp. 4-8; Spady, W.G., (1994) Outcome-Based Education: Critical Issues and Answers, , The American Association of School Administrators; Aziz, A., Megat Mohd Noor, M.J., Ali Abang, A.A., Jaafar, M.S., A Malaysian outcome- based engineering education model (2005) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 2 (1), pp. 14-21; Mansor, W., Hashim, H., Abdullah Che, S.A., Kamaluddin, M.U., Latip Abdul, M.F., Yassin Mohd, A.I., Rahman Ab, T.K., Md Kamal, M., Preliminary results on the implementation of outcome-based education on the non-examinable computer engineering modules (2008) ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, S4B, pp. 20-25; Mohayidin, M.G., Suandi, T., Mustapha, G., Konting, M.M., Kamaruddin, N., Man, N.A., Adam, A., Abdullah, S.N., Implementation of outcome-based education in universiti putra malaysia: A focus on learners' learning outcomes (2008) International Education Studies, 1 (4), pp. 147-160; Hashim, R., Din Mohd, M.A., Implementing outcome based education using project based learning at University Malaya (2009) European Journal of Scientific Research, 26 (1), pp. 80-86; Noor, M.M., Kadirgama, K., Rahman, M.M., Rejab, M.R.M., Bakar, R.A., Ibrahim, A., Education reform model at faculty of mechanical engineering, Universiti Malaysia Pahang (2009) International Journal of Recent Trends in Engineering, 1 (5), pp. 166-177; Aziz, A., Mohamed, A., Arshad, N., Zakaria, S., Masodi, M., Appraisal of course learning outcomes using rasch measurement: A case study in information technology education (2007) International Journal of Systems Applications, Engineering & Development, 4 (1), pp. 164-172; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy sets (1965) Information and Control, 8 (3), pp. 338-353; Zadeh, L.A., Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes (1973) IEEE Transaction on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 3 (1), pp. 28-44; Mamdani, E.H., Assilian, S., An experiment in linguistic synthesis with a fuzzy logic controller (1975) International Journal of Man- Machine Studies, 7 (1), pp. 1-13; Mamdani, E.H., Advances in the linguistic synthesis of fuzzy controllers (1976) International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 8, pp. 669-678","Chua, S.C.; Faculty of Engineering and Technology, 50 Bukit Beruang, Melaka, Malaysia; email: scchua@mmu.edu.my",,9781424473113,,"English","Int.

A fair assessment of FYP2 is therefore crucial to be considered and this paper presented a precise of assessments from supervisor and panel for implementation of a new code EEE368 for Diploma Electrical Engineering Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). The major shortcoming of the former code, KEU380 is that the marks for the final project or prototype were not fairly allocated. Only 10% is allocated for supervisor's evaluation and the students' efforts in accomplishing the final product were not measured. Even though the project is assigned in groups, teamwork was not assessed. Allocation of marks for EEE368 is based on the confidential syllabus from Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FKE) UiTM which are 40% from panel and 60% from supervisor. Hence, the FYP2 committees distributed the marks for a new syllabus as following criteria; for panel evaluations: Presentation Skills and Project Demonstration are 15% and 25% respectively, and for supervisor evaluations: 30% for Writing Skills and 10% for each criteria of Progress Work (Logbooks and meeting with supervisor), Teamwork and Project Demonstration. The benchmark for marks is categorized to poor, moderate, good and excellent and the details are discussed in this paper. © 2010 IEEE.","Assessments; Final Year Project 2; marking scheme; Project demonstrations","Assessments; Final Year Project 2; marking scheme; Presentation skills; Project demonstrations; Writing skills; Demonstrations; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Rating; Supervisory personnel; Technical presentations; Electrical engineering","Velderrama, E., Guidelines for the final year project assessment in engineering (2009) Proceedings of the 39th IEEE International Conference on Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 324-328. , San Antonio, Texas, USA; Robertson, B., Radcliffe, D., Impact of CAD tools on creative problem solving in engineering design (2009) Computer-Aided DeSign, 41, pp. 136-146; Network, G.E., (2008) Guide to Assessing Teamwork and Collaboration, , http://www.galileoorg/tips/rubrics/tcrubric.pdf, Available; Lingard, R., Teaching and assessing teamwork in engineering and computer science (2009) 2nd International MultiConference on Engineering and Technological Innovation, , presented at the The, Orlando, Florida; Teo, C.Y., Ho, D.J., A systematic approach to the implementation of final year project in an electrical engineering undergraduate course (1998) IEEE Transactions on Education, 41 (1), pp. 25-30. , PII S0018935998016781","Rais, S.S.; Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia",,9781424473113,,"English","Int.

This paper discusses the performance of school committees within the management of school facilities in Batubara district of Indonesia. The concepts of Community based Facility Management (CbFM) and Logometrix was deployed as a basis to measure the school committee performance in order to address the needs of quality school management. The data was collected from questionnaires distributed for those who work with and use school facilities spread over seven sub districts of Batubara, Indonesia. The result revealed that performance of existing school committees needed to improve. On the other hand, the measurement of school committee performance was recommended to be used as a guide towards addressing the needs of quality school management and furthermore to improve the quality of education in Indonesia. © 2010 IEEE.","Community based facility management; School committee performance; School facility management","Education systems; Facility management; Indonesia; Low level; Primary education; Quality of education; School committee performance; School facility management; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Facilities; Management; Office buildings; School buildings; Surveys; Technical presentations","(2008) World Bank and Education in Indonesia, , http://go.worldbank.org/YUK7DZANIOI, World Bank.

This course basically teaches the students on how to design microprocessor-based systems. The students have to understand in detail about the architecture of the microprocessor and learn how to write comprehensive assembly language programs. Teaching and learning the theory of programming is a challenging task since it involves the abstract notions and logical thinking. In addition, they have to have the detailed knowledge on the hardware aspect of the processor. Unfortunately, most of these students adopt a surface approach and tend to accept information passively. They also tend to concentrate only on what will be asked in the examinations and prefer to memorize facts rather than reflecting on the purpose and analyzing the information. They need to adopt a deep approach to learning and interact with the content critically in order to integrate both the hardware and software aspects in their design. This paper discusses the integrated, practical, and student-centered approach for teaching this important subject in the Department of Electrical, Electronics and System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). Although the results shown are favorable, continuous effort is needed to ensure students' comprehension on the concept is well established and sustainable. © 2010 IEEE.","integrated learning techniques; Microprocessor course","Abstract notions; Assembly language; Hardware and software; Integrated learning; Logical thinking; Malaysia; Malaysians; Microprocessor course; Student-centered approach; Surface approach; Teaching and learning; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Microprocessor chips; Students; Technical presentations; Teaching","Black, P., Lee, H.C., Marshall, B., Wiliam, D., (2003) Assessment for Learning: Putting It into Practice, , Berkshire, England: Open University Press; Brey, B.B., (2009) The Intel Microprocessors: Architecture and Programming, , Eight edition Pearson International Edition; Felder, R.M., Brent, R., Designing and teaching courses to satisty ABET Engineering criteria (2003) Journal on Engineering Education, 92 (1), pp. 7-25; Felder, R.M., Brent, R., (2004) The ABC's of Engineering Education: ABET, Bloom's Taxonomy, Cooperative Learning, p. 1375. , American Society for Engineering Eduction.

Innovative approach has been put forward in upgrading the context of teaching and learning of physics subject in school. In this project, students have been exposed to real engineering design process through the development of simplified turbidity meter. This project is done by diluting a related university project into a simplified version of the system. A straight forward design approach introduced in this design eliminates the need for complex amplification and algorithmic processing circuitry thus producing a simpler version of turbidity meter that can be easily understood by high school students. The science principles applied through this project has further increase students' appreciation towards physics subjects in school. Hence, reaching beyond school syllabus through the suggested outreach effort should be implemented in broader sense to raise more young interest in physics-engineering. © 2010 IEEE.","education; engineering; outreached effort; turbidity meter","Electrical and computer engineering; Forward designs; High school; High school students; Innovative approaches; Malaysia; outreached effort; Processing circuitry; Real engineering; School project; School students; Science and Technology; Teaching and learning; turbidity meter; University research; Design; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Turbidity; Technical presentations","Karp, T., Gale, R., Lowe, L.A., Medina, V., Beutlich, E., Generation NXT: Building young engineers with LEGOs (2010) IEEE Transactions on Education, 53 (1), pp. 80-87; Tan, K.K., Tang, K.Z., Ng, V., Tay, A., Yen, S.C., Lee, T.H., Bridging physics to electronics- an outreach effort (2010) IEEE Transactions on Education, 53 (1), pp. 3-11; Lopez-Martin, A.J., Attracting prospective engineering students in the emerging european space for higher education (2010) IEEE Transactions on Education, 53 (1), pp. 46-52; Martinez-Jimenez, P., Salas-Morera, L., Pedros-Perez, G., Cuberoatienza, A.J., Varo-Martinez, M., OPEE: An outreach project for engineering education (2010) IEEE Transactions on Education, 53 (1), pp. 96-104; (2010) Statistik, , http://www.mohe.gov.my/webstatistik/index.htm, (Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia), Retrieved on: 18.07.2009; (2008) Labour and Human Resources Statistic 2008, , Ministry of Human Resource Malaysia; Jeffers, A.T., Safferman, A.G., Safferman, S.I., Understanding K-12 engineering outreach programs (2004) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 130 (2), pp. 95-108. , DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2004)130:2(95); Bamforth, S., (2005) Engineering Outreach: A Guide to Working with Schools, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/downloads/scholarart/outreach.pdf, The Higher Education Academy-Engineering Subject Centre, Retrieved on: 03.07.2010; Omar, A.F., Matjafri, M.Z., Turbidimeter design and analysis: A review on optical fiber sensor for the measurement of water turbidity (2009) Sensors, 9 (10), pp. 8311-8335; (2005) Integrated Curriculum for Secondary Schools, Curriculum Specifications, Physics Form, 4. , Ministry of Education Malaysia, Curriculum Development Centre, Ministry of Education Malaysia; (1999) Basic Turbiditimeter Design and Concepts, , http://www.epa.gov/safewater/mdbp/pdf/turbidity/chapII.pdf, Retrieved on: 08.08.2009; (1990) Water Quality-Determination of Turbidity, , International Standard ISO 7027.

The biggest value of knowledge can be achieved in an organization or university when it is shared, as it can help to increase job performance and facilitate new knowledge creation. The aims of this paper are to 1) provide an overview of ITO in institution of higher education, 2) identify factors influencing knowledge transfer in ITO and 3) present a knowledge transfer model for ITO in Malaysia. The findings of the research presented herewith showed that the quality content and accuracy of knowledge to be transferred, distribution capacity of knowledge provider (KP), knowledge receiver's (KR) perceived benefit and knowledge infrastructures or enablers, ICT infrastructure, staff posting, trust and job satisfaction were perceived as important in determining the success of knowledge transfer during an ITO. Through the findings, a model of knowledge transfer in ITO was developed. © 2010 IEEE.","IT Outsourcing (ITO); Knowledge Provider (KP); Knowledge Receiver (KR); Knowledge Transfer; Knowledge Transfer in ITO Model","Distribution capacity; eBusiness; Higher education; ICT infrastructures; Information technology outsourcing; IT outsourcing; Job performance; Knowledge creations; Knowledge Provider (KP); Knowledge receiver; Knowledge Receiver (KR); Knowledge transfer; Knowledge transfer model; Malaysia; Perceived benefits; Quality content; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Information technology; Job satisfaction; Knowledge management; Technical presentations; Outsourcing","Mohamed, A., Arshad, N.H., Abdullah, N.A.S., Knowledge transfer success factors in IT outsourcing environment (2009) WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications, 6 (6). , Retrieved October 5, 2009 from ACM Portal database; Becerra-Fernandez, I., Gonzalez, A., Sabherwal, R., (2004) Knowledge Management: Challenges, Solutions, and Technologies, , New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc; Buniyamin, N., Barber, K.D., The intranet: A platform for knowledge management system based on knowledge mapping (2004) International Journal of Technology Management, 28 (7-8), pp. 729-746; Gottschalk, P., Solli-Saether, H., (2006) Managing Successful IT Outsourcing Relationships, , USA: IRM Press; Hasset, E., Cunningham, P., Kancheva, E., Newsome, M., Wells, S., (2002) It Outsourcing in Higher Education, 1. , http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ers0201/rs/ers0201w.pdf, Retrieved 13th September, 2010, from; Hoecht, A., Trott, P., Outsourcing, information leakage and the risk of losing technology-based competencies (2006) European Business Review, 18 (5), pp. 395-412. , DOI 10.1108/09555340610686967; Hussin, H., Ismail, Z., Suhaimi, M.A., Karim, N.S.A., Examining factors influencing IT outsourcing success in Malaysian organizations (2006) 17th Australian Conference on Information Systems, , http://eprints.utm.my/5544/1/zurainismail06_EFIOS.pdf, Retrieved on August 31, 2009 from; Kasper, H., Muhlbacher, J., (2006) Organizational Context and Knowledge Transfer of A High- Tech MNC: A Balanced Approach to Successful European-Asian Cooperation, IAMOT 2006 Conference, , http://www.iamot.org/conference/index.php/ocs/10/paper/viewFile/148/679, Retrieved March 24, 2009 from; Kishore, R., Rao, H.R., Nam, K., Rajagopalan, S., Al Et, C.A., A relationship perspective on IT outsourcing (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (12). , http://deliveryacm.org/10.1145/960000/953464/p86kishore.pdf?key1= 953464&key2=9193977321&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&CFID=27817668& CFTOKEN=82249997, Retrieved March 24, 2009 from; Lientz, P.B., Larssen, L., (2004) Manage IT As A Business: How to Achieve Alignment and Add Value to the Company, , UK: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann; Ismail, M.B., Yusof, Z.M., (2008) Factors Affecting Knowledge Sharing in Public Organizations in Malaysia, , http://www.kmice.uum.edu.my/kmice08/Paper/CR96.doc, Retrieved March 24, 2009 from; Nonaka, Takeuchi, H., (1995) The Knowledge Creating Company: How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation, , New York:Oxford University Press; Abdullah, N.A.S.B., Aho, V., (2007) A Study of Factors Influencing Knowledge Transfer in Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) in Public Sector, , Thesis Dissertation; Orlic, M., Curin, T., Zagar, M., Software engineering education in developing countries- responding to the outsourcing challenges (2003) 25th Int.

These activities, in which students teach and learn from each other, provide ways for students to explore new paths and consolidate understanding. One method of enhancing active learning during tutorial classes is through collaborative or groupwork activities assingned to students of Semiconductor Devices Course at Faculty of Electrical Engineering. During tutorials students were divided into groups, Each group consisted of four students. Each group was assigned different problem-solving activities on the topics that had been taught in lectures. The studens were given half an hour to discuss among themselseves to solve the tutorial problems which were given accodingto Bloom's Taxanomy consisting of understanding, knowledge, application and analysis. Then representative of each group would present on the board on how to go about solving their work activity by defining the problem, drawing diagrams and solving the mathematical problems involved. As the students presented their work, the lecturer would guide them along, if they got stuck with it until they finally be able to solve the tutorial problem and learned a lot from each other and from the lecturer on the subject matter that had been taught in classes. This whole scenario of activities were implemented for every tutorial lesson from the beginning till the end of the semester for class EE2105B of semester July to December 2010, until each sudent had the chance to participate presenting. At the end of the semester survey questions were given to find out the students' perceptions on this collaborative active learning in engineering tutorials regarding cognitive, communication skills and their acvhievement. It was found that over 90 % of the students agreed that groupwork activities had enhanced their cognitive and social skilss. They agreed on the benefits of groupwork tutorial activities that could encourage active learning and the opportunities of improving communication skills. © 2010 IEEE.","Active Learning; Bloom's Taxanomy; Engineering Tutorials; Groupwork Activities","Active Learning; Bloom's Taxanomy; Communication skills; Engineering curriculum; Groupwork Activities; Mathematical problems; Subject matters; Taxanomy; Teamwork skills; Work activities; Blooms (metal); Curricula; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Engineers; Problem solving; Semiconductor devices; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Engineering education","Chung, W.-T., Stump, G., Hilpert, J., Husman, J., Kim, W., Lee, J.E., Addressing engineering educators' concerns: Collaborative learning and achievement (2008) Proceeding of 38th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 3-7; Vogt, C.M., Hocevar, D., Hagedorn, L.S., A social cognitive construct validation: Determining women and men's success in engineering programs (2007) The Journal of Higher Education, (78); Prince, M., Does active learning work?

The study is based on a three years experience (2008-2010). The following will be clarified, the list of criteria adopted by AMS to ensure quality and the procedures adopted by AMS to apply accreditation standards to ensure quality of outputs.The study followed the iterative descriptive approach in analyzing the topics. The results show the procedures how the standards were applied to ensure the quality of outputs by meeting the requirements in all aspects, national and international, especially of the internationally recognized organization Council on Occupational Education COE, by which the AMS was then accredited in June 2010. A four year development strategic plan is set for the department to ensure consistent quality and improvement standards. By reviewing the literature of former experiences of Arab and international bodies for accreditation and quality assurance, the study concluded a list of accreditation criteria and indicators of quality assurance, as well as indicators to ensure the quality of the university environment. The achieved number of accreditation and quality assurance standards are presented from both national and international organizations and were found to be: 25 accreditation standards leading to 245 indicators, and 41 indicators for QA, and 29 indicators for the QA of the university environment.The study recommended the need to activate the academic accreditation and assessment of academic programs periodically internally and externally. Furthermore, similar departments of applied medical sciences should adopt the presented accreditation and quality assurance principles. In addition those departments are asked to put a strategic plan that meets their needs and goals. © 2010 IEEE.","Accreditation standards; Applied Medical Sciences; Benchmark; Biomedical Engineering; Quality assurance","Academic program; Accreditation criteria; Benchmark; Community college; Consistent quality; International accreditation; International organizations; Medical science; Strategic plan; University environment; Accreditation; Benchmarking; College buildings; Engineering; Engineers; International cooperation; Medicine; Quality assurance; Quality control; Standardization; Strategic planning; Technical presentations; Engineering education","Tu'Aima, R., TQM in education indicators of excellence and accreditation standards (2006) The Foundations and Applications, , 1st ed., House Walk, Amman; Abu-Dakka, S., Arafu, L., Accreditation and quality assurance for teacher education programs, Arab and international experiences Working paper submitted for the workshop (2007) The Complementary Relationship between Higher Education and Basic Education, Training Programs and Teacher Training, , Islamic Universiyt, Gaza, 2007; Amer, T., Standards and models of total quality management in higher education (2007) Journal of the Association of Arab Universities, 4, pp. 355-381; Ai-Rub, E., Under the model to evaluate the quality of an academic program in higher education institutions in the Arab world (2007) Journal of the Association of Arab Universities, 4, pp. 443-475; Hunaiti, A., (2005) Workshop Axis II of the National Conference of Higher Education and Scientific Research Amman Private University, , Amman; Lagrosen, S., Seyyed-Hashemi, R., Leitner, M., Examination of the dimensions of quality in higher education (2004) Journal of Quality Assurance in Education, 12 (2), pp. 61-69. , DOI 10.1108/09684880410536431; Bronmann, L., Mittag, S., Quality assurance in higher education metaevaluation of multi-stage evaluation procedure in Germany (2005) The International Journal of Higher Education and Educational Planning, 52 (4), pp. 687-709; Gift, S., Bell-Huntchinson, C., Quality assurance and the imperatives for improved student experiences in higher education: The case of the university of the west indies (2007) Journal of Quality in Higher Education, 13 (2), pp. 145-157; Kaaouachi, A., Model to evaluate the institutions of higher education in the Arab world (2007) Journal of Federation of the Universities of Arab States, 4, pp. 501-525; Hajjar, R., Japanese experience in accreditation and quality assurance of higher education institutions and the lessons learned from them (2005) Proceedings of the Conference of the Quality of University Education, University of Bahrain, pp. 275-298. , Bahrain; Eaton, J., An overview of us accreditation council for high education accreditation (2006) ERIC Accession Number ED 494266, p. 12; (2006) Perspectives on Accreditation: A Report of the CHEA Presidents Project, (1), p. 24. , Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA.

The success of this approach can generally be seen especially to promote, advertise and market product effectively besides staying competitive in global environment. The dramatic reduction in the cost of computer hardware is put forward as the major reason for the increasing importance of computer-aided learning (CAL). Computer-aided learning or CAL usually delivers more realistic views of product to customer. Due to its distinctive characteristics of interactive, user-friendly as well as attractive, people are keen to keep explore and hardly get bored. Compared with the old-fashioned way, CAL applications assist customers to avoid from overlooking necessary information. On the company side, this helps to achieve paperless situation by replacing or reducing the usage of paper. Certainly, this saves a lot of cost in terms of printing manuals, pamphlets and fliers. The case study presented is computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine at CNC Lab, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Industri Selangor named VMC-1000 produced by GATE company. The multimedia authoring software applied to succeed this study are Macromedia Director, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro and Gold Wave.

From the author's observation of a group of Civil and Construction Engineering (C&C) students at Curtin Sarawak, students do not seem to practice performing calculation-based problem-solving. Therefore, this study aims to understand the situation by identifying the C&C students' learning practices for design or calculation - based problem solving in Curtin Sarawak. This is achieved through the use of a specially designed questionnaire and also through focus group interviews with groups of students. The collected information is reduced into a number of content units from the total responses.

Attention has first been posed on a particular phone model, and a comparison between the absorbed power distribution and steady-state temperature increases has been carried out. The antenna output power was set to be consistent with the portable telephones of 600 mW, maximum SAR values, averaged over 1 gm, from 2.1 to 3.6 W/kg depending on the considered phone. The maximum temperature increases are obtained in the ear and vary from 0.22 C to 0.39 C, while the maximum temperature increases in the brain lie from 0.07 C to 0.17 C. These steady-state temperature increases are obtained after about 48 min of exposure, with a time constant of approximately 6 min. Application of the ANSI/IEEE safety guidelines restricting the 1 gm averaged spatial peak SAR to 1.6 W/kg results in the maximum temperature rise in the brain from 0.07 C to 0.15 C at 900 MHz. Finally, considerations about the exposure limits in the considered frequency are made. © 2010 IEEE.","electromagnetic heating; finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method; mobile phone; specific absorption rate (SAR); temperature increase","900 MHz; Absorbed power distribution; Anatomically based model; ANSI/IEEE; Bio-heat equations; Cellular telephones; Electromagnetic heating; Exposure limits; Human head; Maximum temperature; Maximum temperature rise; Output power; Safety guidelines; Specific absorption rate; Steady-state temperature; temperature increase; Time constants; Absorption; Electromagnetic field effects; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electromagnetism; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Finite difference time domain method; Radar antennas; Technical presentations; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone; Time domain analysis; Telephone sets","Kunz, K.S., Luebbers, R.J., (1993) The Finite Difference Time Domain Method for Electromagnetics, , Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press; Taflove, A., (1995) Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, , Norwood, MA: Artech House; (2005) IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, , IEEE Standard C95.1-2005, 3 kHz to 300 GHz; Guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields up to 300 GHz (1998) Health Phys, 74 (4), pp. 494-522. , ICNIRP Guidelines; Wang, J., Fujiwara, O., FDTD computation of temperature rise in the human head for portable telephones (1999) IEEE Trans.

Due to the concerns over the off campus Bachelor of Electrical Engineering students' poor percentage of completion and low percentage of students that achieve Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) above 3.00 at the University of Teknologi MARA (UiTM), a study was initiated to identify the reasons for the poor performance. This paper presents the outcomes of the investigation. The investigation was based on a survey that involved 23 respondents who are lecturers teaching courses/subjects within the programme. The survey was categorized into three parts; the students' academic performance, their attitude and class behavior and their soft skills. Results indicate that the student's mathematical skills and knowledge in engineering fundamental basics are very low. In addition, their attitude and class behavior are probably the reason why they cannot score high CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). However these students seem to posses good soft skills. It is hoped that the findings will help to identify issues related to the off-campus course management so that countermeasures can be implemented to ensure continuous improvement to the programme. © 2010 IEEE.","Course Management; Cumulative Grade Point Average; Off-campus; Percentage of Completion; Soft Skills","Course management; Cumulative Grade Point Average; Off-campus; Percentage of Completion; Soft skills; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Investments; Personnel training; Surveys; Teaching; Technical presentations; Students","(2007) The Effectiveness of Academic Programmes at Higher Educational Institutions (HEls) Towards Lifelong Learning, , National Higher Education Research Institute (IPPTN); Sirinaovakul, B., Managing a web-based university in Thailand (2008) Special Issue of the International Journal of the Computer, the Internet and Management, 16; Ali, A., (2005) Life Long Learning: Policy of Malaysia and the Role of OUM, , Seminar organized by Korea National Open University, 14-16, November; Smith, M.K., Malcolm Knowles, informal adult education, self-direction and andragogy The Encyclopedia of Informal Education, , www.infed.orglthinkers/et-knowl.htm, Retrieved 2002 from:; (2001) Government of Malaysia, the Third Outline Perspective Plan, , Prime Minister's Department, Percetakan Nasional Malaysia Berhad, Retrieved 2010; The Official Website of Malaysian Qualification Agency, , www.mqa.gov.my, Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia.

How does the new demand for understanding of parallel computing impact computer science education? In this paper, we examine several aspects of this question: (i) What parallelism body of knowledge do today's students need to learn? (ii) How might these concepts and practices be incorporated into the computer science curriculum? (iii) What resources will support computer science educators, including non-specialists, to teach parallel computing? (iv) What systemic obstacles impede this change, and how might they be overcome? We address these concerns as an initial framework for responding to the urgent challenge of injecting parallelism into computer science curricula.

The course brings students and entrepreneurs together with innovation projects centered around the productive sector. This paper presents the experience of the course ""Innovation with Communication and Information Technologies"" in which, within the CDIO (Conceive-Design -Implement - Operate) framework (with an initial observation stage), a group of entrepreneurs from the ICT sector act as coaches for teams of students who, in an autonomous way, propose innovative and sustainable projects. Based on an evaluation process based on the Cybersyn methodology of indicators and indexes, evidence is generated of a growth in innovation and teamwork abilities as well as student development during the last year of undergraduate studies. This paper is structured in three parts: (1) a review of the literature associated with the development of abilities and innovation and teamwork in engineering schools with an emphasis on the phases of CDIO; (2) a detailed description of the process and evaluation of the proposed course in computer engineering; and (3) the main results obtained during the last year that will enable the proposal to be replicable in other engineering courses.

A cross-sectional study of undergraduate engineering students was conducted at a medium-sized Midwestern private university. A large-scale survey of all undergraduate engineering students, ∼1100, yielded responses from ∼ 700 students during the spring of 2009. Survey questions were based on a study approach defining adulthood by Jeffrey Arnett, but specifically applied to engineering identity as a parallel but unique instrument. Engineering identity from a student perspective was assessed, both in terms of self-identification (do engineering students consider themselves to be engineers?) and identifying factors that are ""necessary"" to be considered an engineer. A qualitative inquiry followed to better inform the quantitative survey results. Individual student interviews across class levels and engineering self- identifications were conducted as a collection of case studies. While it was not surprising to find that individual student experiences contribute to an overall sense of belonging to the college, it was interesting that key experiences such as internships and undergraduate research were not found to be statistically significant predictors of engineer self-identification. Student interviews offered insight into this finding; those experiences were formative, but there is a bi-directionality to these experiences-they can be either affirming or discouraging. Students cited experiences that were positive, challenging learning opportunities as reaffirming their engineering identity as it relates to future career plans. Conversely, negative student experiences were also formative but were related to non-identification and dissuaded students from future engineering related career plans. Finally, the implications for an institution's curricular structure as it relates to engineering identity are discussed as are suggestions for promoting multiple student experiences before graduation and formal assessment of those experiences. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Identity; Professional persistence; Student experiences",,"Augustine, N., (2005) Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for A Brighter Future, , National Academies Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of 21st Century - Committee on Science, and Public Policy, Editor., National Academies Press: Washington, D.C; Duderstadt, J., Engineering for a changing world (2008) A Road Map to the Future of Engineering Practice, Research, and Education, p. 131. , University of Michigan: Ann Arbor, MI; (2009) National Science Foundation: Bachelor's Degrees by Field and Sex 1998-2007, , http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/pdf/tabc-4.pdf, NSF [cited 2010 05/10/2010]; Bachelor's Degrees in Engineering - 2007: 68,274 engineers /55,621 male /12,653 female; (2008) Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education, , http://www.engr.washington.edu/caee/, CAEE.

The system displays a set of multiple-choice problems along with the correct answer and several carefully designed distracters. The distracters correspond to typical mistakes that undergraduate students make according to the authors' teaching experience. Depending on students' choices, the system provides them with appropriate, timely feedback and prompts them to solve other problems to practise their problem-solving skills further. In this way students solve a different set of problems of different difficulty levels according to their particular learning needs. The system also has the capability of providing other didactic resources such as tutorials or virtual learning environments, such as active simulators, to enhance student learning. Owing to its flexible structure, the system allows for the sharing of test banks and didactic resources between different courses and professors. It also keeps track of student performance and generates specific reports. The software was tested using a sample of 169 undergraduate engineering students taking physics courses. Using a pre-test/post-test assessment tool, it is found that students using the software (the focus group) have a larger average integrated learning gain than students who did not use it (the control group). This conclusion is supported by a statistical analysis based on Z tests. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Adaptive on-line training; Engineering education; Learning gain; Physics problem-solving",,"Young, H.D., Freedman, R.A., (2008) University Physics, , Pearson-Addison Wesley, 12th edn, San Francisco CA, USA; Tipler, P.A., Mosca, G., (2008) Physics for Scientists and Engineers, , Freeman, 6th edn, New York, NY; Halliday, D., Resnick, R., Walker, J., (2008) Fundamentals of Physics, , Wiley, 8th edn, Hoboken, NJ; Hussmann, S., Covic, G., Patel, N., Effective teaching and learning in engineering education using a novel web-based tutorial and assessment tool for advanced electronics.

This study explores the link between project-organized learning and group creativity. We regard group creativity as a socio-cultural concept, influenced by factors from a social and cultural context. Relating this point to project-organized learning in engineering education in China, this paper focuses on which factors influence group creativity development in project-organized teams. Multiple methods including questionnaire and interview were employed. A CCQ (Creative Climate Questionnaire) survey was conducted among 126 members from 25 teams at seven universities. Interviews were carried out with eight team leaders. Research findings show that a series offactors such as task challenge, group diversity, conflict, group size and membership change etc. influence group creativity interactively; however, risk taking is not encouraged in these teams, which could be the potential barrier to creativity. Therefore this paper has contributions to implications for engineering education innovation. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Chinese culture; Engineering education; Group creativity; Project-organized team",,"Sheppard, F.S.D., MacAtangay, K., William, A.C., Sullivan, M., (2009) Educating Engineers, Designing for the Future, , Jossey-Bass, San Franciso; Amabile, T.M., (1996) Creativity in Context, , Westview Press, Boulder; Sternberg, R.J., (1999) Handbook of Creativity, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Paulus, P.B., (2003) Group Creativity: Innovation Through Collaboration, , Oxford University Press, USA; Craft, A., (2005) Creativity in Schools: Tensions and Dilemmas, , Routledge, New York; Ekvall, G., Arvonen, J., Lindblad, I., (1983) Creative Organizational Climate, Construction and Validation of A Measuring Instrument, Report2, , Swedish Council for Management and Work Life Issues, Stockholm; Ekvall, G., Organizational climate for creativity and innovation (1996) European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 5 (1), pp. 105-123; Wu, J.J., Ye, Y.Z., Zheng, Y.Y., (2000) Development of Scales of Influencing Factors from Personality Characteristics, Family Environment and Educational Environment on Creativity, , Community of Science in Taiwan, Taiwan; Rugarcia, A., Felder, R.M., Woods, D.R., Stice, J.E., The future of engineering education (2000) Chemistry Engineering Education, 31 (1), pp. 16-25; Thompson, G., Lordan, M., A review of creativity principles applied to engineering design (1999) Professional Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 213, pp. 17-31; Cropley, D.H., Cropley, A.J., Fostering creativity in engineering undergraduates (2000) High Ability Studies, 11, pp. 207-219; Kazerounian, K., Foley, S., Barriers to creativity in engineering education: A study of instructors and students perceptions (2007) Journal of Mechanical Design, 129, pp. 761-768; Du, X.Y., De Graaff, E., Kolmos, A., (2009) Research on PBL Practice in Engineering Education, , Sense Publishers, Rotterdam; Fernandes, S., Flores, M.A., Lima, R.M., Using the CIPP model to evaluate the impact of Project-led Education: A case study of engineering education in Portugal (2009) Research on PBL Practice in Engineering Education, pp. 45-55. , X.

The objective of this work is to introduce a support didactic material for use in computational classes of Chemical Reaction Engineering. The development of the work is based on a direct implementation of examples of the well-known Fogler's textbook ""Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering"" in an equation-based dynamic simulator: EMSO. The problems were implemented in a way to preserve the structure of the problem as described in the textbook. The results are illustrated by graph plots generated in the simulator, allowing comparisons with the results presented in the textbook and detailed analyses for effects of variables in the problem. The problems are easily modified, allowing the student to analyze several possibilities, changing equations and values of variables, for example, and observing the results. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","chemical engineering education; chemical reaction engineering; computer aided teaching; process simulator","Chemical reaction engineering; Computational tools; computer aided teaching; Didactic materials; Dynamic simulators; Learning process; Process simulators; Chemical elements; Chemical reactions; Engineering; Newtonian flow; Simulators; Teaching; Textbooks; Engineering education","Motard, R.L., Himmelblau, D.M., Current situation on the use of computers in the education of chemical engineers in the USA (1979) Comp Chem Eng, 3, pp. 213-216; Rose, L.M., Rippins, D.W.T., The current situation on the use of computers in chemical engineering education in Europe (1979) Comp Chem Eng, 3, pp. 221-223; Calo, J.M., Andres, R.P., Use of interactive graphics-based software for teaching chemical engineering principles (1981) Comp Chem Eng, 5, pp. 197-209; Edgar, T.F., Mah, R.S.H., Reklaitis, G.V., Use of computers in chemical-engineering education (1985) Chem Eng Prog, 81, pp. 9-13; Seader, J.D., Education and training in chemical engineering related to the use of computers (1989) Comp Chem Eng, 13, pp. 377-384; David, I., Bogle, L., An introductory course in computer aided process engineering (CAPE) (1996) Comp Chem Eng, 20, pp. 1323-S1327; Kassim, H.O., Cadbury, R.G., The place of the computer in chemical engineering education (1996) Comp Chem Eng, 20, pp. 1341-S1346; Shacham, M., Cutlip, M.B., Selecting the appropriate numerical software for a chemical engineering course (1999) Comp Chem Eng, 23, pp. 645-S648; (2006), Aspen Technology Inc., ""Aspen Engineering Suite,"" Cambridge; (1996), Hyprotec Ltd., HYSYS.Process, Calgary; (2005), Process Systems Enterprise Ltd., gPROMS ModelBuilder, London; Soares, R.P., Secchi, A.R., EMSO: A new environment for modelling, simulation and optimization (2003) 13th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering, pp. 947-952. , Elsevier Science Publishers; Soares, R.P., (2003) Desenvolvimento de Um Simulador Genérico de Processos Dinâmicos, p. 162. , School of Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, p; (2006) Trac: A Web-based Project Management System, , Edgewall Software, Umeå; Fogler, H.S., (1999) Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering, , Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle, NJ; Froment, G.F., Bischoff, K.B., (1979) Chemical Reactor Analysis and Design, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Hill, C.G., (1979) An Introduction to Chemical Engineering Kinetics and Reactor Design, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Levenspiel, O., (1999) Chemical Reaction Engineering, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Missen, R.W., Mims, C.A., Saville, B.A., (1999) Introduction to Chemical Reaction Engineering and Kinetics, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Smith, J.M., (1981) Chemical Engineering Kinetics, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Cutlip, M.B., Shacham, M., (1998) Polymath, , Willimantic","Rodrigues, R.; Group of Integration, Modeling, Simulation, Control, and Optimization of Processes (GIMSCOP), Rua Eng.

Teachers designed their online courses with the assistance of a support e-learning team and questionnaires were used for teachers and students to express their views on the online courses. Teachers pointed out that the online courses by themselves would be able to tackle limited lecture time and strengthen the students' background knowledge. Students, on the other hand, stated that their difficulties regarding the courses could be facilitated by using a more interactive teaching approach with the use of collaboration tools and receiving individual feedback. Thus, students suggested that teachers adopt a more student-centred approach by using VLE. Teachers' and students' perspectives were related to their personal characteristics, as students were more familiar with everyday e-communication tools. © 2010 SEFI.","Blended learning; Computer-supported collaborative learning; Engineering education; Online learning; Virtual learning environments",,"Al-Senaidi, S., Lin, L., Poirot, J., Barriers to adopting technology for teaching and learning in Oman (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (3), pp. 575-590; Bangert, A.W., The Seven Principles of Good Practice: A framework for evaluating on-line teaching (2004) The Internet and Higher Education, 7 (3), pp. 217-232; Barak, M., Transition from traditional to ICT-enhanced learning environments in undergraduate chemistry course (2007) Computers & Education, 48 (1), pp. 30-43; Blas, T.M., Serrano-Fernández, A., The role of new technologies in the learning process: Moodle as a teaching tool in Physics (2009) Computers & Education, 55 (1), pp. 35-44; Bliuc, A.M., Goodyear, P., Ellis, R., Research focus and methodological choices in studies into students' experiences of blended learning in higher education (2007) The Internet and Higher Education, 10 (4), pp. 231-244; Cagiltay, N.E., Using learning styles theory in engineering education (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (4), pp. 415-424; Carver, C.A., Howard, A.R., Lane, W.D., Enhancing student learning through hypermedia courseware and incorporation of student learning style (1999) IEEE Transactions On Education, 42 (1), pp. 33-38; Christie, M., Jurado, R.G., Barriers to innovation in online pedagogy (2009) European Journal of Engineering Education, 34 (3), pp. 273-279; Cortizo, J.L., Blended learning applied to the study of Mechanical Couplings in engineering (2010) Computers & Education, 54 (4), pp. 1006-1019; Ellis, R., University teacher approaches to design and teaching and concepts of learning technologies (2009) Teaching and Teacher Education, 25 (1), pp. 109-117; Felder, R.M., Brent, R., Understanding student differences (2005) Journal of Engineering, 94 (1), pp. 57-72; Felder, R.M., Silverman, L.K., Learning and teaching styles in engineering education (1988) Engineering Education, 78 (7), pp. 674-681; Galanouli, D., Murphy, C., Gardner, J., Teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of ICT-competence training (2004) Computers & Education, 43 (1-2), pp. 63-79; Goodyear, P., Pedagogical frameworks and action research in open and distance learning [online] (1999) European Journal of Open and Distance Learning, , http://www.eurodl.org/materials/contrib/1999/goodyear/, June, Accessed 7 October 2008; Granić, A., Mifsud, C., Ćukušić, M., Design, implementation and validation of a Europe-wide pedagogical framework for e-learning (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (4), pp. 1052-1081; Heap, N.W., Kear, K.L., Bissell, C.C., Anoverviewof ICT-based assessment for engineering education (2004) European Journal of Engineering Education, 29 (2), pp. 241-250; Heaton-Shrestha, C., Introducing a VLE into campus-based undergraduate teaching: Staff perspectives on its impact on teaching (2005) International Journal of Educational Research, 43 (6), pp. 370-386; Heaton-Shrestha, C., (2007) Learning and E-learning In HE: The Relationship Between Student Learning Style and VLE Use, 22 (4), pp. 443-464. , Research Papers in Education; Limniou, M., Papadopoulos, N., Kozaris, I., The role of simulations and real-time applications in collaborative learning (2009) Collaborative Learning: Methodology, Types of Interactions and Techniques, , In: E.

This study examines 30 fourth-year chemical engineering students, graduates of a university course designed to combine their terminological domain with sustainability-oriented goals, focusing on topics like corporate sustainability, developing environmental policy, introduction to ISO 14001-Environmental Management Systems (EMS), and environmental legislation. The study explores their perception of industrial-environmental issues and asks-How did the study unit influence the students' ability to use their preexisting scientific knowledge, while relating to industrial-environmental issues? Our findings indicate that engineering students can develop industrial-environmental awareness, and make use of interdisciplinary knowledge beyond that strictly related to the realm of engineering. Regarding the research's particular aim-i. e. determining the study unit's influence on students' ability to relate industrial-environmental issues to their own field of engineering-the findings indeed show a change in the students' conceptions of environmental elements related to industry. The course graduates became more attentive to the environmental aspects associated with building and opening a factory, and the concepts they raised in connection with the topic gained in variety. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Engineering education; Environmental literacy; Environmental management systems",,"Adams-Webber, J., A review of repertory grid theory, research, and applications (2006) J Construct Psychol, 19, pp. 351-353; Allenby, B.R., Allen, D.T., Davidson, C.I., Teaching sustainable engineering (2007) J Ind Ecol, 11, pp. 8-10; Allenby, B., Murphy, C.F., Allen, D., Davidson, C., Sustainable engineering education in the United States (2009) Sustain Sci, 4, pp. 7-15; Ashford, N.A., Major challenges to engineering education for sustainable development (2004) Int J Sustainab High Educ, pp. 239-250; Azapagic, A., Perdan, S., Shallcross, D., How much do engineering students know about sustainable development?

It is, therefore, important to educate potential engineers with the necessary skills required in today's technologically developed industry. In this study, CIM laboratory settings and applications in Turkish engineering education are surveyed in an investigation of the curricula used in these laboratories. In this context, the CIM curriculum in Kirikkale University is described. Improvement areas in CIM education and usage of laboratories are discussed.

To learn more about what drives students to enroll in engineering programs, three universities in Lebanon were targeted as a case study. A survey with Likert-scaled items measuring different types of influences and motives were completed by 387 undergraduate engineering students. After rating the potential influence sources, a genuine interest in the field appeared to be the main influence affecting the students' own decision. An exploratory Factor Analysis was applied to the various intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors and generated four categories: personal growth, professional growth, social growth, and financial growth. One-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that the professional growth including job satisfaction that improves the level of students' creativity in a challenging environment was the leading motivator for choosing engineering. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Engineering enrollment; Middle East; Student motives",,"Roese, N.J., Summerville, A., What we regret most ...and why (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31 (9), p. 1273; Walstrom, K.A., Kent, A., Schambach, T.P., Jones, K.T., Crampton, W.J., Why are students not majoring in information systems?

This software application can be used for processes with unidirectional and multidirectional heat exchanges and it permits the user to model and simulate them quickly and with a reduced computing load. This is possible thanks to a simple generic model library or blockset implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The models included in this library can be easily linked in order to build holistic structures. In addition, the dimensions and features of the objects modelled can be simply defined. The simulations run by means of this library are fast and they do not need a wide range of computer resources in comparison to those based on discrete finite element models (FEM). Thanks to all these characteristics, this blockset can be considered a useful tool to didactic purposes and to multi-physic simulation applications. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Cosimulation; Didactic application; Engineering education; Holistic modelling; Multi-physic simulation; Object-oriented interface; Thermal model; Thermal simulation",,"Lasance, C.J.M., Ten years of boundary-condition-independent compact thermal modeling of electronic parts: A review (2008) Heat Transfer Engineering, 29 (2), pp. 149-168; Mills, A.F., (1998) Heat Transfer, p. 954. , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Luna, J.J., Tocados, D., Martinez, P., Barranco, V., Varo, M., Dynamic analysis of heat transfers by Laplace transform (2009) American Institute of Physics Conference Proceeding 2008, 1148, pp. 538-541. , Crete (Greece)25-30 September; Janicki, M., De-Mey, G., Napieralski, A., Thermal analysis of layered electronic circuits with Green's functions (2007) Microelectronics Journal, 38 (2), pp. 177-184; Luna-Rodriguez, J.J., Barranco-Lopez, V., Gonzalez-Redondo, M.J., Ruiz-Garcia, J., Garcia-Aznar-Escudero, J., Simulación térmica de dispositivos eléctricos y electrónicos mediante modelos en espacio de estado (2004) XIV Reunión de Grupos de Investigación de Ingeniería Eléctrica, pp. 104-113. , 1-2 April 2004, Barcelona; Albagul, A., Khalifa, O., Wahyudi, O., MATLAB and simulink in mechatronics education (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (5), pp. 896-905; Varadarajan, M., Valsan, S.P., MatPECS-A MATLAB-based power electronic circuit simulation package with GUI for effective classroom teaching (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (4), pp. 606-611; Krysl, P., Trivedi, A., Instructional use of MATLAB software components for computational structural engineering applications (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (5), pp. 778-783; Ahlstrom, J., Christie, M., Using a MATLAB exercise to improve the teaching and learning of heat conduction during welding (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (5), pp. 769-777; Klee, H., (2007) Simulation of Dynamic Systems with MATLAB and Simulink, p. 784. , CRC Press, Boca Raton; Spiegel, M.R., (1991) Transformadas de Laplace, p. 261. , McGraw Hill, México; Braithwaite, N., Weaver, G., (1990) Electronic Materials inside Electronic Devices, p. 424. , The Open University, London; Holman, J.P., (1997) Heat Transfer, p. 725. , MacGraw-Hill, New York; Steinberg, D.S., (1991) Cooling Techniques for Electronic Equipment, p. 512. , Wiley-Interscience, New York; Pecht, M., (1991) Handbook of Electronic Package Design, p. 904. , Marcel Dekker, New York; Ayasun, S., Nwankpa, C.O., Transformer tests using MATLAB/Simulink and their integration into undergraduate electric machinery courses (2006) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 14 (2), pp. 142-150; Martinez-Jimenez, P., Varo-Martinez, M., Perez, G.P., Martinez, M.C.G., Bellido, M.S.C., Urena, M.J.A., Fernandez-Sanchez, J., Tutorial and simulation electrooptic and acoustooptic software as innovative methodology to improve the quality of electronic and computer engineering formation (2006) IEEE Transactions on Education, 49 (2), pp. 302-308; http://rvininf12.uco.es/sites/default/files/titulaciones/ITIElectronica/ asignaturas/guiasECTS/9033039.pdf, Polytechnic High School in the University of Cordoba, (Accessed 8 March 2010)","Luna-Rodriguez, J.-J.; Department of Computer Architecture, Spain; email: el1luroj@uco.es",0949149X,,,"English","Int.

The goals were to assess motivation for creativity in architectural design and engineering design students based on the Cognitive Orientation theory which defines motivation as a function of a set of belief types, themes, and groupings identified as relevant for the development of creativity. Differences between the two groups of students were expected in some of the scores of the belief types, themes, and groupings. Participants were 112 students (52 from architecture, and 60 from engineering) who were administered the questionnaire of the Cognitive Orientation of Creativity. Significant differences in numerous motivational contents were observed between the groups of students. Major characteristics of the architectural design students were an emphasis on the inner world, inner-directedness, and a development of the self, and of the engineering design students being receptive to the environment, and demanding from oneself despite potential difficulties. The findings provide insights for intervention programs targeted at improving architectural and engineering design education. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Architecture; Cognitive orientation; Creativity; Design education; Engineering; Motivation","Cognitive orientation; Creativity; Design education; Engineering design; Engineering design education; Inner world; Intervention programs; Architectural design; Engineering; Engineering education; Motivation; Product design; Structural design; Teaching; Students","Amabile, T.M., (1983) The Social Psychology of Creativity, , Springer New York; Arnon, R., Kreitler, S., Effects of meaning training on overcoming functional fixedness (1984) Current Psychological Research and Reviews, 3, pp. 11-24. , 10.1007/BF02686553; Burleson, W., Developing creativity, motivation, and self-actualization with learning systems (2005) International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 63, pp. 436-451. , DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2005.04.007, PII S1071581905000467; Casakin, H., Davidovitch, N., Milgram, R.M., Creative thinking as a predictor of creative problem-solving in architectural design (2009) Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, , Accepted; Casakin, H., Kreitler, S., Correspondences and divergences in creativity: Evaluations between architects and students (2008) Environmental Planning and Design: Design B, 35, pp. 666-678. , 10.1068/b3405; Casakin, H., Kreitler, S., Motivational aspects of creativity in students and architects: Implications for education (2008) Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, , A.

This innovative course introduces undergraduate civil engineering students to methods in sustainability indicators, life-cycle analysis, environmental input-output analysis, and risk analysis to evaluate the environmental impacts and public health impacts of civil engineering design. The paper discusses the learning objectives and course themes of preventive design, multicriteria decision making, and systems-level analysis. The course syllabus and the design project in which students were asked to design a water transmission pipeline and evaluate its environmental impacts are discussed in detail. An overview of the pedagogical methods and student evaluation tools employed in the course is given. An evaluation of learning outcomes and student impressions of the course suggest that topics on design for environment, sustainable development in an international context, and the interface between sustainability, engineering, and policy development should be included in future editions of the course. © 2010 ASCE.","Applied sustainability; Civil engineering; Design; Environmental impact; Pollution prevention; Public health","Applied sustainability; Civil engineering students; Design for Environment; Design projects; Engineering design; Input output analysis; Learning objectives; Learning outcome; Life cycle analysis; Multi criteria decision making; Pedagogical method; Policy development; Pollution prevention; Public health; Student evaluation; Sustainability indicators; Undergraduate Courses; Water transmission pipelines; Civil engineering; Curricula; Decision making; Design; Engineering education; Health; Health risks; Innovation; Natural gas transportation; Pollution; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Environmental impact","(1996) Code of Ethics, , http://www.asce.org, ASCE.

This paper presents a thorough study of practical training in the field of civil and construction engineering. Based upon an extensive literature review of the practical training curriculum worldwide, questionnaires were provided to contractors, educators and students in Taiwan to assess problems in traditional summer practical training courses for civil and construction engineering in Taiwan. At the outset of the study, it was thought that the lack of available jobs for students might be related solely to the economy but the findings indicated that the reasons were more complex ranging from concerns about liability for students working in construction sites to traditional cultural concerns about whether apprentices should be paid. The Delphi method was used to study the problems that were identified, relating to planning, execution, evaluation, and development of the existing practical training programs. A refined and improved summer practical training curriculum is proposed for civil and construction engineering education in Taiwan based upon the findings. Although the survey related to practical training programs for engineering students was conducted in Taiwan, the results might vary in other countries. The procedures used, and results obtained may be valuable resources and have a potential use for other countries. What is certain is that practical training can play an important role in readying engineering students for the work place in any location and making the practical training as effective and as safe as possible should be a universal goal. © 2010 ASCE.","Civil engineering; Construction engineering; Engineering education; Practical training curriculum","Construction engineering; Construction sites; Delphi method; Literature reviews; Practical training; Work place; Civil engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Engineering education","Belcher, M.C., Building studentsbuilding a house (1995) Proc., 1995 Annual ASEE Conf., Part 1, 1, pp. 1364-1368. , Vol., American Society for Engineering Education, Washington, D.C; Clarke, B.G., Introducing students to professional practice in civil engineering (2007) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 133 (2), pp. 107-115. , DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2007)133:2(107); Cleary, D.B., Sun, C.C., Course in professional practice issues (2003) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 129 (1), pp. 52-57. , DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2003)129:1(52); Delatte, N., Undergraduate summer research in structural engineering (2004) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 130 (1), pp. 37-43. , DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2004)130:1(37); Farr, J.V., Sullivan, J.F., Rethinking training in the 1990s (1996) J.

This study used unconventional methods to stimulate interest in STEM fields among high school students in a rural county of Tennessee. First, the study began by assessing enrollment data from each of Tennessee's 95 counties to determine the factors that influenced the decision by high school applicants to choose engineering at Tennessee Technological University (TTU). The findings revealed that, while there were no significant differences between the aptitude scores of applicants from rural and urban counties, TTU had a higher representation of freshmen from urban areas. This indicated that motivational programs targeted at counties with low population, income level, and education level were needed to boost enrollment from rural counties. As a response, we introduced next a hands-on engineering class at Jackson County High School (JCHS) that was tied to the national-level program called ""Project Lead the Way."" With JCHS lying in a rural setting right along the Cumberland River, an engineering risk study was completed in front of the class to demonstrate the risk of failure of the Wolf Creek Dam (in Kentucky), which lies upstream. The idea was to leverage a real-world engineering infrastructure and a natural hazard phenomenon (overflooding) that had direct and visible implications on the lives of the county, as a way to promote the societal value of STEM disciplines to students at JCHS. These efforts were monitored through a series of pre- and posttests to determine the effectiveness of the hands-on teaching methods and engineering risk analysis of a real-world infrastructure. The testing efforts showed a significantly positive impact on student perception of STEM fields in pursuit of engineering innovation. Student assessment of perceptions of engineering proved that the use of real-world water risk analysis of a nearby infrastructure as a motivational tool in a rural high school setting is very effective to boost awareness of STEM fields and engineering. © 2010 ASCE.","Engineering education outreach; Risk analysis; Rural counties; STEM fields","Engineering infrastructure; Engineering innovations; Engineering risk analysis; Hands-on engineering; High school; High school settings; High school students; Income levels; Jackson; K-12 schools; Kentucky; Natural hazard; Perceptions of engineering; Real-world; Risk of failure; Rural counties; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Societal values; STEM fields; Student assessment; Student perceptions; Teaching methods; Tennessee; Tennessee Technological University; Testing effort; Urban areas; Wolf Creek; Innovation; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Rivers; Students; Engineering education","Augustine, N.R., (2005) Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for A Brighter Economic Future, , National Academies, Washington, D.C; Brophy, S., Klein, S., Portsmore, M., Rogers, C., Advancing engineering education in P-12 classrooms (2008) J.

It builds on the large potential of using CAL in education. CAL tools could offer a better learning environment for students, as they provide an excellent opportunity for applying and testing the management skills learned in classroom, but are difficult to implement in reality. In this research, the CAL tool focuses on improving students' decision-making skills in the aspects of excavation and related activities. These are excavation equipment, dewatering, and soil-support methods. It also covers mobilization, surveying, safety, overtime shifts, and reporting. Students compete with regard to time, cost, and quality of construction of a given project. The game flow is nonlinear as it depends on students' decisions. Wrong decisions deviate the construction flow to a path that costs money and time, while reducing quality. This must be corrected costing extra money and time. The game was tested by senior practicing engineering and university professors. Then, it was tested by senior undergraduate construction students. Both groups agreed that the game responds, to a great extent, to the characteristics of effective CAL software, and that the information provided could not be easily assimilated or practiced through the usual tutorial or demonstration educational format. 18% of the professionals and 72% of students indicated the usefulness of the game in applying management and decision-making skills. 60-70% of students believed that it improved their technical skills in dewatering, soil-support, and excavation activities. In addition, 80% of the professionals found the game presenting realistic soil-support and excavation situations, while 72% of students became more appreciative of the interdependencies between activities. © 2010 ASCE.","Buildings; Computer-aided instruction; Construction management; Decision making; Egypt; Engineering education; Excavation; Simulation","Construction engineering; Construction management; Egypt; Excavation equipment; Learning environments; Learning tool; Management skills; Simulation; Support method; Technical skills; College buildings; Computer aided instruction; Computer simulation; Dewatering; Engineering; Engineering education; Excavation; Project management; Soils; Students; Teaching; Decision making","Abourizk, S., A stochastic bidding game for construction management (1992) 2nd Canadian Conf. on Computing and Civil Engineering, pp. 576-587. , CSCE, Ottawa; Al-Jibouri, S., Maudesley, M., Design and experience with a computer game for teaching construction project planning and control (2001) Eng., Constr., Archit.

Utilising an approach based upon grounded theory methodology, 30 participants including teachers, representatives of government bodies and non-profit providers of primary level engineering initiatives were interviewed. Three main concepts were identified during the analysis of findings, each relevant to primary engineering education. These were pedagogic issues, exposure to engineering within the curriculum and children's interest. The paper concludes that the opportunity to make a real difference to children's education by stimulating their engineering imagination suggests this subject area is of particular value. © 2010 SEFI.","Attracting young people; Conceptual framework; Engineering education; Primary school; STEM",,"Alexander, R., (2010) Children, their World, their Education: Final Report and Recommendations of The Cambridge Primary Review, , London: Routledge; Anderson, J.R., (1995) Learning and Memory: An Integrated Approach, , Chichester:Wiley; Brophy, S., Advancing engineering education in P-12 classrooms (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3), pp. 369-387; Coon, D., (1983) Introduction to Psychology, , 3rd edition.

Nowadays online simulative environments are indispensable tools for teaching computer numerical control (CNC) course in mechanical engineering. Nevertheless, past studies seldom designed CNC code or program error handling mechanisms, and failed to use new emergent technologies and applications. This study proposed a design for a WSISLE-CNC (web service-based interactive and simulated learning environment for CNC) based on Web service technology. A questionnaire survey from vocational school instructors and students revealed a high degree of enthusiasm for this proposed approach. In summary, the main contributions of this study to engineering education are: (1) development of several types of CNC code or program error handling mechanisms and applications, and (2) use of Web service concepts and technology to develop various kinds of CNC simulation services. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals Inc.","computer numerical control; computer-assisted learning; error handling mechanisms; learning technology; virtual learning environment","Computer numerical control; computer-assisted learning; error handling mechanisms; Learning technology; Virtual learning environments; Computer aided instruction; Computer control systems; Numerical control systems; Surveys; Teaching; Technology; Web services; Engineering education","Kearsley, G., Shneiderman, B., Engagement theory: A framework for technology-based teaching and learning (1998) Educ Technol, 38, pp. 20-23; Parush, A., Hamm, H., Shtub, A., Learning histories in simulation-based teaching: The effects on self-learning and transfer (2002) Comput Educ, 39, pp. 319-332; Huang, S.H., Su, Q., Samant, N., Khan, I., Development of a web-based integrated manufacturing laboratory (2001) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 9, pp. 228-237; Cheng, S.I., A study of a remote CNC instruction simulation with CORBA technology (2003) The 3rd National Conference on Precision Mechanical Manufacture; Hutchinson, T.C., Kuester, F., Hardware architecture for a visualization classroom: Vizclass (2004) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 12, pp. 232-241; Ong, S.K., Mannan, M.A., Virtual reality simulations and animations in a web-based interactive manufacturing engineering module (2004) Comput Educ, 43, pp. 361-382; Vossen, G., Westerkamp, P., E-learning as a web service (2003) The 7th International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS'03); Kong, S.C., Kwok, L.F., An interactive teaching and learning environment for graph sketching (1999) Comput Educ, 32, pp. 1-17; Hinostroza, J.E., Mellar, H.G., Pedagogy embedded in educational software design: Report of a case study (2001) Comput Educ, 37, pp. 27-40; Rodriguez, J., Anido, L., Fernandez, M.J., How can the Web services paradigm improve the e-learning?

Many graduates enter the work force with exceptional development skills, but lack proficiency in test, debugging, and analysis skills. This is in part because academic curricula emphasize development at the expense of teaching software testing as a formal engineering discipline. The majority of curricula today emphasize the initial phases of a development life cycle, namely: requirements gathering, architecture design, and implementation. The skills which are retained in this area of test are often learned ad-hoc while working on solutions for an implementation-oriented course. The lack of formal test education among graduates forces industry to spend substantial resources to properly educate graduates in the art and science of software testing. The contribution of this paper to the literature includes an evaluation of software testing as an industry profession, a survey of current curricula guidelines, a survey of software testing education in practice today, and a discussion of ongoing efforts to advance the status of software testing in academic curricula through a novel, crowd-sourced, industry-expert, approach to software test education. ©2010 IEEE.","Computer science education; Courseware; Education; Software engineering; Software testing","Analysis skills; Architecture designs; Art and science; Computer Science Education; Courseware; Curricula guidelines; Engineering disciplines; Initial phasis; Quality product; Requirements gathering; Role of software; Software test; Teaching software testing; Work force; Computer science; Computer software selection and evaluation; Computer testing; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering; Formal methods; Industry; Software testing; Surveys; Engineering education","(2009) B.S. in Computer Science Curriculum Requirements Page, , http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/currreq.html, Carnegie Mellon University, June [Online].

In order to nurture EI development , the authors believe the learning environment must change from a teacher centred 'dispenser of all knowledge' environment to a student centred climate which takes a more encompassing view of the learning experience. This paper discusses the importance of Emotional Competencies as a key non-technical skill set that can: 1) assist an engineering student to have a successful university education experience, 2) ensure the graduating student is a desirable employee in the global workforce and 3) as an assessment measure within the Lifeplace Learning (LPL) education model. Knowledge of the emotional intelligence levels of engineering students will provide insight into the emotional and social capabilities of our students. Documented within are the first results of a longitudinal study investigating the similarities and differences in the EI competencies of three different student cohorts at the same university.

In particular, this paper describes the award winning Bachelor of InnovationTM (BI) family of degrees at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, which is a unique partnership between the schools of business and engineering that includes four BI degrees in engineering. We first examine the motivation and need for a radically new approach. This approach is based on a new common core of innovation courses and family of degrees and majors, in contrast to efforts at many schools that offer only a single major or course. A critical element of this radical approach is that the program span across departments, colleges, and even beyond the boundaries of the university. Second, we describe in detail the BI degree structure and summarize the unique aspects of the program, from the three-year multi-disciplinary team experience to the trademarked name. We present our BI program as its own case study in innovation within higher education and review the key challenges we faced. We then review existing university engineering programs and demonstrate the unique position of the BI family of degrees relative to these other programs. We conclude with lessons learned and a look at some accomplishments so far. ©2010 IEEE.","Business; Education; Engineering; Innovation; Multidisciplinary","Business; Critical elements; Degree structure; Engineering innovations; Engineering program; Higher education; Multi-disciplinary teams; Multidisciplinary; New approaches; University of Colorado; Engineering research; Innovation; Societies and institutions; Engineering education","Florida, R., The Role of the University: Leveraging Talent, Not Technology (1999) Science and Technology, , Issues in Summer; (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, p. 5. , National Academy of Engineering.

Although the projects have varied widely, more often than not, success or failure lies within the students' ability to see beyond the technical challenges into the subtleties of the business and the meaning of value. Looking back at our traditional software engineering curriculum it is not so surprising that gaps in technical skills are not typically the source of problems. With a strong traditional focus on the construction of software, we have been producing graduates who can build relatively complex stand-alone systems. Unfortunately, in today's world, being able to build software is only a small, albeit necessary, skill for software engineers and it is miles away from being sufficient [1, 2]. The challenges inherent in providing a portfolio of innovative, integrated, and strategic IT services are well beyond any of the techniques or conceptual frameworks historically taught in many software engineering curriculums [3-5], including our own. To address these shortcomings we have recently begun experimenting with a new curriculum that presents software engineering in its larger context as a strategic business function. We are also beginning to stress the importance of using a set of analytic frameworks to guide the evolution and development of software systems starting with the business and its context, through the architecture and design stages, and finally into implementation and support. To create materials for this curriculum we have gone back to the original voice of the problem and are attempting to assemble learning materials from the projects that industry has championed for us in the past. Our goal is not merely to showcase the software that was built, but rather to expose the reasons behind their conception and the frameworks used to make critical decisions throughout the process. ©2010 IEEE.","Case studies; Curriculum; Education; Software engineering","Applied research; Capstone design projects; Case studies; Conceptual frameworks; Curricular materials; Design stage; Engineering curriculum; Industrial partners; IT services; Learning materials; See-Beyond; Software engineering curricula; Software engineers; Software systems; Standalone systems; Strategic business; Student project; Technical challenges; Technical skills; Curricula; Industry; Information technology; Innovation; Research; Software design; Students; Engineering education","Chesbrough, H., Spohrer, J., A research manifesto for services science (2006) Communications of the ACM, , Jan; Maglio, P., Srinivasan, S., Kreulen, J., Service systems, service scientists, SSME, and innovation (2006) Communications of the ACM, , Jan; Shaw, M., Software engineering education: A roadmap ICSE '00: Proceedings of the Conference on the Future of Software Engineering, Jan. 2000, pp. 371-380; Moore, D., Voltmer, D., Curriculum for an engineering renaissance (2003) IEEE Transactions on Education, 46 (4), pp. 452-455. , Jan; Shaw, M., Herbsleb, J., Ozkaya, I., Root, D., Deciding what to design: Closing a gap in software engineering education ICSE '05: Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, Jan. 2005, pp. 607-608; Hayes, A., Krippendorff, K., Answering the call for a standard reliability measure for coding data (2007) Communication Methods and Measures, 1, pp. 77-89; Herreid, C.F., What is a Case?

It had created a worldwide movement in terms of curriculum both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In Malaysia particularly, several universities have offered Masters programs in SSME. In UKM itself efforts are taken to develop a Masters program in SSME in which the program is designed uniquely covering three main areas of service science, namely the technology, management and the engineering. The curriculum is designed by taking into consideration the importance of service fundamental topics and the three main areas stated. The curriculum framework contains four main components known as Service Foundation, Strategic Service Development, Service Science Concentration which covers three main areas; Technology, Management and Engineering, and Service Science Business & Technology Integration (Capstone). Based on the framework, the program will be offered across the three main faculties in UKM, specifically the Engineering, Business and IT school. Service foundation consists of topics that will provide the contextual foundation and the core knowledge required for service science. The contextual foundation will focus on providing the service context in understanding the customers, organizations, processes and external environment. The core courses on the other hand will focus on developing the competence in innovating and improving service systems using specialized tools in which this are the courses that forms the Strategic Service Development component. The challenge faced in designing such curriculum is determining the approach in teaching for the services subjects as the audience will come from various backgrounds such as Engineering, IT and also Management. This paper reports the challenges faced in designing the service science curriculum particularly for the Engineering concentration and challenges in realizing the agenda of establishing the program in the university. ©2010 IEEE.","Curriculum design; Engineering concentration; Service science","Core course; Curriculum designs; Curriculum development; Engineering faculty; External environments; Main component; Malaysia; Post-graduate levels; Service development; Service science; Service systems; Services sectors; Specialized tools; Technology Integration; Concentration (process); Curricula; Engineering; Foundations; Hand tools; Information technology; Teaching; Engineering education","(2008) World Trade Report.

Recent changes in accreditation criteria call for greater competences in these skills to be achieved in the undergraduate programme. An argument is presented that this requires a change from the traditional approach to engineering education to a group-based project driven one as this is compatible with concurrent development of both technical and non-technical learning outcomes. Just as a clear path of progression exists from the fundamentals of science in stage one to the advanced engineering content in the final year so too should personal skills be developed in a progressive structured way. This paper presents a strategy that is currently being developed and implemented in the School of Electrical Engineering Systems in the Dublin Institute of Technology in a four year Bachelor of Engineering programme. In the group-based project-driven approach students practice communication and team work skills not in isolation to but integrated with the programme's technical content. The early stages of the programme focus on strongly developing the group learning process and introducing students to a reflective practice so they can observe and improve performance. Tutor observation fades in later years as students become more adept at managing group work and self-directed learning. This strategy is designed to progressively change a dependent freshman student into an independent graduate who is prepared for the challenges ahead. ©2010 IEEE.","Accreditation criteria; Group based learning; Key skills; PBL; Personal competences; Reflective practice; Self-directed lifelong learning","Accreditation criteria; Group-based; Key skills; Life long learning; PBL; Personal competences; Reflective practices; Accreditation; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Knowledge engineering; Students; Engineering education","(2009) Skills in Creativity, Design and Innovation, , Expert Group on Future Skills.

This paper describes the features and efficiency of certain instruments and methods that the University of Craiova applies to adjust its engineering curricula to the regional industry requirements. The engineering faculties within University of Craiova included in their curricula the Professional Communication Techniques Course. The faculties' staffs investigated this topic's utility in developing the students' communication skills, its applicability area and the correlation with industry recruiter's requirement.

An integrated strategic framework for engineering education and practice is presented to support defining a roadmap of knowledge and skills for future engineers. The framework comprises the three domain pillars of engineering science, design and commercialization with a contextual element of management, culture and professionalization. Each pillar has a vertical hierarchy of knowledge, methods, skills and transition to practice from freshman to senior professional and above. Relative weaknesses in knowledge, methods, skills and transition to practice are highlighted in the design pillar and contrasted unfavorably with clinical teaching in medicine. The lack of a recognized route in technology commercialization is highlighted. Strategies suggested by the framework include: a broader integrative foundation on entry; teaching a more explicit sense of professionalization; professional degrees in the design and commercialization pillars; and strengthened post-experience teaching of engineering approaches across adjacent professional domains, a skill increasingly important in large scale systems engineering. A set of high-level strategic actions is derived from the framework for defining more detailed initiatives for a roadmap of knowledge and skills for future engineers. ©2010 IEEE.","Commercialization; Design; Engineering education; Engineering science; Professionalization","Commercialization; Contextual elements; Engineering science; Professional degree; Professionalization; Roadmap; Strategic frameworks; Technology commercializations; Design; Engineers; Knowledge engineering; Medical education; Professional aspects; Engineering education","www.boeing.com/educationrelations/attributes.html; www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/compsci/20080728/index.shtml?sa_campaign= InstoneBlog; Vest, C., Educating engineers for 2020 and beyond (2006) Brunel Lecture Series on Complex Systems, , MIT Engineering Systems Division; Williams, R., Education for the profession formerly known as engineering (2003) Chronicle Review, 49 (20); Burrage, M., From practice to school-based professional education (1993) The European and American University since 1800, , Chapter 4 in S.

In the turn of the 21st century, a significant number of engineering universities in the United States (US) and Europe have opened branches in the Middle East and North Africa region. In 2004, the American University of Kuwait (AUK), in collaboration and partnership with Dartmouth College, opened its doors to offer the first liberal arts education with an engineering program in the region. AUK and Dartmouth, which has the second oldest engineering program in the US, have recognized the demand for a sustainable institution that can educate the individual student as well as society as a whole. Engineering, technology and the way we do business is changing and growing at such a fast pace that we must in turn change the way we educate. No longer is it adequate to be main stream, we must be willing to foster and support creative programs which meet increasing demands for higher quality, broader knowledge base and global outreach. AUK's Computer Engineering curriculum is built on four pillars: Math and Science; Computer Engineering Design; Entrepreneurship; and Arts Humanities and Social Sciences. The paper presents AUK's experience in balancing core academics and non-technical skills of engineering students that include communication, creative thinking and problem solving, information management, leadership, organizational skills and teamwork. Furthermore, the paper presents AUK practices in offering cross-disciplinary training experience in which engineering students develop professional competence in areas outside their home discipline.

This approach provides students with a solid understanding of basic concepts before they subsequently study more advanced topics such as applied dynamics, mechanics of solids & structures, and mechanics of fluids. MEEN10030, Mechanics for Engineers, is a compulsory course taught annually in Semester I to 280 First Year engineering students at University College Dublin, Ireland's largest university. The syllabus topics include forces, Newton's laws of motion, statics in two and three dimensions, equilibrium, friction, trusses and cables, distributed forces, centers of mass and centroids, motion, and kinematics of a particle and of a rigid body. Traditional teaching of this subject relies solely on formal lectures and tutorials, without any laboratory sessions or student assignments, both of which are resource intensive. Following an overall program review in 2004-05, this course was completely revised and the subject material was rationalized with regard to what is taught in subsequent 2nd year courses. A major innovation involved providing team-based assignments to the entire 280 students in which groups of up to 5 students are set a design competition directly related to one specific topic from the course material. Competitions have been held for the past two years, with very satisfactory outcomes in terms of not only their application of concepts learned in the course, but also in terms of reinforcing soft skills essential for a satisfactory and successful engineering career. ©2010 IEEE.","Engineering design; Engineering mechanics; Team-based projects; Undergraduate teaching","Active Learning; Basic concepts; Centers-of-mass; Course material; Design competitions; Distributed forces; Engineering careers; Engineering design; Engineering mechanics; First-year engineering; Fundamental principles; Ireland; Laboratory sessions; Mechanics of solids; Newton's laws of motion; Non-technical skills; Rigid body; Soft skills; Student assignments; Student competitions; Subject materials; Team-based projects; Three dimensions; Traditional teachings; Undergraduate engineering; Undergraduate teaching; Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Engineers; Mechanics; Professional aspects; Reinforcement; Teaching; Students","Gilchrist, M.D., Manufacturing & design with engineering polymers: Educational aspects of a specialist dissertation in a part-time elective postgraduate mechanical engineering degree course for industry-based students (1999) Int.

Through 5-year (preparatory + 4) education, ECEE introduces basic sciences then concentrates on specific technical skills for a computer engineer. There is a big gap between what the student learns and what he finds in practical life whether he would be an employee or an entrepreneur. This paper proposes a new approach where the ECEE will be oriented towards the type of business not the skill. This will narrow the gap between academic and vocational education. Choices of business are completely based on industry and market demand that should be flexible and dynamic. Based on the student's choice, he would study all what is related to that business. This will necessitate interdisciplinary programs oriented towards the business type to be inserted in the curriculum as well as cross-faculties projects which will require some kind of protocol between engineering and non-engineering faculties. It will also require a change in the curriculum of the non-engineering faculties that will participate in the cross faculty projects. Evaluation of this proposal is presented using questionnaire targeted at undergraduates and post-graduates. ©2010 IEEE.","Business type; Computer specialization; Cross-faculty projects","Basic science; Business type; Computer engineering education; Computer engineers; Cross-faculty projects; Curricular reforms; Egyptians; Engineering faculty; Interdisciplinary programs; Market demand; New approaches; Technical skills; Vocational education; Curricula; Engineering; Engineers; Students; Engineering education","Micu, E., Engineering higher education issues within the economic reform (2002) A Romanian Case Study; Ibrahim, A., Current issues in engineering education quality (1999) Global Journal of Engineering Education, 3 (3); Finch, C.R., Crunkilton, J.R., (1989) Curriculum Development in Vocational and Technical Education, pp. 220-221. , London: Bostan; Simoneau, R., Magenau, J., Ford, R., On Building a Business/Engineering Education Partnership 35th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, 2005; (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering; Anis, H., (1992) Developing Engineering Education in Egypt Experience and Achievements, , Personal Communication; Abdellah, G., Taher, S., Abdel-Rahman, M., Recent developments in egyptian engineering education through competitive projects National Committee Meeting, End of Term of HEEPF Phase 7, 27 Dec, 2008","Salama, M.; Computer Engineering Dept., , Cairo, Egypt",,9781424460427,,"English","IEEE Transforming Eng.

ISD is viewed as an organizational change project that aims at improving an organization through the adoption of IT applications. The course is designed following a project led approach. The project involves describing an organization as a system, describing its information handling activities and proposing a set of IT applications that could be adopted and used. Students are guided by an ISD methodology that demands the application of previous developed competencies in areas such as: organization theory, accounting, marketing, information systems fundamentals, data bases, software engineering, computer networks and several other IT courses. Together with the ISD course, students are also taking courses on organizational behavior and data-warehousing. Students are organized into large teams of 10 to 12 members. Several roles are distributed among team members: e.g., team leader, analyst, document officer, technology officer, methodologist, development tools specialist, IT specialist. Students are suggested a fictional organization in a specific business area. Ideally students should deal with a real organization. As the course is having around 100 students enrolled this is not possible. However it is common that each project team finds an organization in the proposed business area where they go and have actual contact with an organization. The main outputs of the project include: project plan; organization description including - purpose, environment, main activities, business ontology, main performance indicators; general information systems description using UML; requirements for an IT application; IT architecture. One of the most important steps of the project is to decide on what IT to suggest to the organization. The decision should take into consideration the capability of current IT, the specifics of the business area and its current practices. Besides the reports, each team makes two public presentations. The first one is to present the organization description making sure business is clearly understood. The final one is to present the solution in terms of information systems and IT architecture. These presentations are attended by industry guests that focus their attention on the students' communication skills from the perspective of a manager. The evaluation of students' performance is based on: reports corresponding to the outputs mentioned above; public presentations; weekly assessments of the teams' progress. The final mark attributed to each team (a numerical value from 0 to 20, where above 10 is a pass) can be re-distributed among team members, by themselves, in order to account for different levels of commitment or effort within the team. Several other rules are set in order to promote professional behavior. ©2010 IEEE.","Capstone course; EngIS methodology; IS professionals; ISD process; Large teams; Project led approach","Capstone course; EngIS methodology; IS professionals; ISD process; Large teams; Project led approach; Benchmarking; Data warehouses; Engineering education; Information systems; Management; Management information systems; Network architecture; Ontology; Software engineering; Students; Teaching","(2005) Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report, , ACM, AIS, and IEEE-CS; Cheney, P.H., Hale, D.P., Kasper, G.M., Knowledge, skills and abilities of information systems professionals: Past, present, and future (1990) Information and Management, 19, pp. 237-247; Watson, H.J., Young, D., Miranda, S., Robichaux, B., Seerley, R., Requisite skills for new MIS hires (1990) Data Base, 21, pp. 20-29; Khan, M.B., Kukalis, S., MIS professionals: Education and performance (1990) Information and Management, 19, pp. 249-255; Lee, D.M.S., Trauth, E.M., Farwell, D., Critical skills and knowledge requirements of IS professionals: A joint academic/industry investigation (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19, pp. 313-340; Couger, J.D., Davis, G.B., Dologite, D.G., Feinstein, D.L., Gorgone, J.T., Jenkins, A.M., Kasper, G.M., Valacich, J.S., IS'95: Guideline for Undergraduate IS Curriculum (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19, pp. 341-359; Gorgone, J.T., Davis, G.B., Valacich, J.S., Topi, H., Feinstein, D.L., Herbert, J., Longenecker, E., (2002) IS 2002 Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Information Systems, , Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Association for Information Systems (AIS), Association of Information Technology Professionals (AITP); Gorgone, J.T., Gray, P., Stohr, E.A., Valacich, J.S., Wigand, R.T., MSIS 2006: Model curriculum and guidelines for graduate degree programs in information systems (2006) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 17; (2009) IS Curriculum Wiki, , ACM and AIS","Carvalho, J.

In this paper the development of a new skills line within the System Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM) bachelor and master program is presented. The skills line in the bachelor program consists of nine different skills, in the categories: project skills, personal skills and academic skills. In contrast, the skills line of the master program focuses on a set of skills categorized into design, professional and academic skills. The introduction of the skills line has helped students not only to acquire the necessary skills, but external parties also better understand the program when the typical skills are presented. Evaluation results from an Alumni survey show that the skills are important to their current jobs and the skills are treated well in the program. It is important that the relationship between education and practice is explicitly addressed. ©2010 IEEE.","Competences; Skills; Systems engineering","Alumni survey; Bachelor programs; Competences; Engineering curriculum; Engineering program; Evaluation results; Master programs; Personal skills; Policy analysis; Skills; System engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Students; Systems engineering; Engineering education","Meijers, A.W.M., Overveld, C.W.A.M.V., Perrenet, J.C., (2005) Criteria for Academic Bachelor's and Master's Curricula, , 3TU; Bruijn, H.D., Herder, P.M., Systems and Actor Perspectives on Sociotechnical Systems (2009) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man.

Community based service learning has long been promoted as a viable and effective means of improving student engagement by the use of both practical experiences and periods of reflection. In 2008, a pilot project was initiated to examine opportunities to embed service learning into the degree programmes offered by the discipline of Electrical & Electronic Engineering. This has now evolved into a programme which all undergraduate students of the discipline (i.e. completing bachelor programmes in Electronic Engineering and Electronic & Computer Engineering) must complete during the third year of their four year under-graduate degree programme. This module has replaced a traditional group project based module which typically involved project topics related to either course work or the research interests of academic staff. The new service learning based module requires the students to complete a 6 month group project involving community partner organisations who work with clients who have various forms of physical disabilities. A focus group based evaluation of the module involving the various stakeholders in the initiative is presented in the paper. This review highlights the degree to which the module achieves its aim of enhancing the learning outcomes across the complete technical and non-technical skills spectrum. ©2010 IEEE.","Electronic engineering education; Reflective learning; Service learning","Academic staff; Computer engineering; Degree programmes; Electronic computers; Electronic engineering; Electronic engineering education; Focus groups; Graduate degrees; Group projects; Informatics; Learning outcome; New services; Non-technical skills; Physical disability; Pilot projects; Practical experience; Reflective learning; Service learning; Student engagement; Undergraduate degrees; Undergraduate students; University of Ireland; Research; Students; Engineering education","Stanton, T., Giles, D., Cruz, N., (1999) Service-learning: A Movement's Pioneers Reflect on Its Origins, Practice and Future, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Lima, M., Oakes, W., (2006) Service-learning: Engineering in Your Community, , St Louis, Missouri, USA: Great Lakes Press; Moffat, J., Decker, R., Service-learning reflection for engineering: A faculty guide (2000) Projects That Matter: Concepts and Models for Service-learning in Engineering, , Tsang, E., ed.

However, many of the challenges that they face in the course of their studies are attributable to a lack of appropriate training in non-technical skills. The paper shows how the integration of content-based instruction and interdisciplinary project-based learning can be used to enhance the acquisition of English and, at the same time, enhance other non-technical skills. This approach gives the students an early insight into the disciplinary topics covered by the university. This head start helps students make both ends meet: they achieve the required language proficiency while bolstering their content knowledge. The result of this research shows that although this method of teaching might not have been initially favored by all students and faculty, the benefits are clearly agreed upon by all parties. ©2010 IEEE.","Content-based instruction; Engineering education; Interdiscilinary project-based learning; Non-technical skills","Content knowledge; Content-based instructions; Engineering program; Interdisciplinary project; Key issues; Language proficiency; Non-technical skills; Project based learning; United Arab Emirates; Engineering; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Markes, I., A review of literature on employability skill needs in engineering (2006) European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (6), pp. 637-650; Brinton, D., Snow, M., Wesche, M., (1989) Content-based Second Language Instruction, , New York: Newbury House; Crandall, J., Collaborate and cooperate: Teacher education for integrating language and content instruction (1998) English Teaching Forum, 36 (1), pp. 2-9; Davenport, D., Experience using a project-based approach in an introductory programming course (2000) IEEE Transactions on Education, 43 (4), pp. 443-448; Macias-Guarasa, J., Montero, J., San-Segundo, R., Araujo, A., Nieto-Taladriz, O., A project-based learning approach to design electronic systems curricula (2006) IEEE Transactions on Education, 49 (3), pp. 389-397; Ho, M., Rad, A., Chan, P., Project-based learning: Design of a prototype semiautonomous vehicle (2004) IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 24 (5), pp. 88-91; Railsback, J., (2002) Project-based Instruction: Creating Excitement for Learning, , http://educationnorthwest.org/webfm_send/460, [Online booklet], Available at; Collier, V., Age and rate of acquisition of second language for academic purposes (1987) TESOL Quarterly, 21 (4), pp. 617-641; Cummins, J., Age on arrival and immigrant second language learning in Canada: A reassessment (1981) Applied Linguistics, 11 (2), pp. l32-l49","El-Sokkary, W.; Advanced University Placement Department, , Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; email: welsokkary@pi.ac.ae",,9781424460427,,"English","IEEE Transforming Eng.

Many Universities are now actively pursuing course development to meet this need. However, the authors propose that certain aspects of course development must be considered if the content is to be anything other than a re-packaging of existing modules. Considering the basic inter / multi-disciplinary nature of SSME any course designed to meet the increasing demand for this level of understanding, must include multidisciplined aspect in its design. The design, development and implementation of the identified framework have been developed based on a case study with IBM, and are exploratory in nature. The framework was also developed using input from four different stakeholder groups; Engineering, Computing Science, Management, and Industry Partners. This paper will outline the assumptions made in the development of the framework, the structure and delivery mechanism of the subsequent multi-disciplined electives, and how the electives can be used to support existing postgraduate and executive training. This direct input has been used to develop a series of six electives. These electives are focus on the needs of postgraduate / professionals moving into senior management positions. Therefore, the delivery mechanism for the electives is modular to allow for the electives to be included in a range of postgraduate and executive programmes. Professional engineers live and work in a context rich environment, and do not tend to break their working days up in to subject specific segments. The reality is that they are expected to work with multiple subjects at the same time. Because of this the framework looks to develop and deliver content in a 'themic' way, as opposed to the more traditional subject based delivery. The electives are now being made available to University of Glasgow MBA students for 09/10. This will be extended to M.Eng, MSc and executive training programmes through 2010/11. The authors believe that this framework helps academic institutes understand the nature of SSME training required by customer-orientated organizations, and provide content based on service themes, as opposed to the more traditional approach of providing the content based on individual topics. ©2010 IEEE.","Course development; Pedagogical frameworks; Service innovation; SSME","Academic institutes; Computing science; Content-based; Course development; Delivery mechanism; Engineering professional development; Executive training; Multi-disciplinary; Pedagogical frameworks; Professional engineer; Re-packaging; Related content; Senior management; Service innovation; SSME; Stakeholder groups; Subject-specific; University of Glasgow; Engineering education; Innovation; Societies and institutions; Curricula","Abe, T., The development of service science (2005) Japanese Economy, 33 (3), pp. 55-74; Chesbrough, H., Spohrer, J., A research manifesto for service science (2006) Communications of the ACM, 49 (7), pp. 35-40; Spohrer, J., Maglio, P.P., Bailey, J., Gruhl, D., Steps toward a science of service systems (2007) IEEE Computer Journal, pp. 71-77. , January; Paton, R.A., McLaughlin, S.A., Service innovation and the Supply Chain: Managing the complexity (2008) European Management Journal, 26 (2), pp. 77-83; Francis, D., Bessant, J., Targeting innovation and implications for capability development (2005) Technovation, 25 (3), pp. 171-183. , DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2004.03.004, PII S0166497204000525; Miozzo, M., Walsh, V., (2006) International Competitiveness and Technological Change, , Oxford University Press; Yin, R.K., (2002) Case Study Research, , (3rd Ed) Sage Publications.

Training development and assessments generally linked in the cognitive domain, with the focus on the mental constructs of the trainee or learner. However employees who perform well in training are not necessarily going to be better in their professional capacity. Non-cognitive influences will affect the employee proficiency. Non-cognitive, affective (feeling) and psychomotor (doing), issues affect cognitive performance significantly and are worthwhile domains to explore in investigating in how trainees learn. The efficiency of the trainee and employee will depend, not only on the training received, but also his/her personality traits. Motivation, attitude, anxiety, culture and gender are all factors, which have been examined in this paper in relation to training and achievement. The paper introduces these concepts within the training environment of the manufacturing industry. In conclusion we affirm the belief that noncognitive factors are as important to the sustainability of training and trainee proficiency. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Cognitive domain; Cognitive factors; Cognitive performance; Manufacturing industries; Personality traits; Professional capacity; Training development; Engineering education; Personnel; Personnel training","Acelajado, M.J., (2003) The Impact of Using Technology on Students Achievement, Attitude, and Anxiety in Mathematics, , University Research Coordination Office, De La Salle University, Manila; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Beck, A., (1985) Anxiety Disorders and Phobias.

Unfortunately, much of the benefit of these techniques to engineering students is lost in translation, in part due to the disconnect between introductory computing courses and the disciplinary courses that introduce problems that could benefit from computational techniques. A considerable body of literature has documented the ineffectiveness of traditional programming courses in transferring usable knowledge to students, specifically where problem-solving skills and computational thinking are concerned. This paper describes a transformative change to the instruction of introductory computing to engineering students, in the context of a single non-major course. In the proposed architecture, a core ""lecture"" is supplemented with plug-in domain-specific modules and problems that are presented in domain-specific recitation/laboratory sections. The focus of the lecture component of the course is to introduce the core concepts and skills required for computational thinking, including algorithms and software engineering techniques. The recitation/laboratory component encourages and guides the application of these skills to introductory problems in engineering. The objective is to shift the emphasis from the minutia of the syntax of textual programming languages to computational thinking. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Computational technique; Computational thinkings; Domain specific; Engineering techniques; Introductory computing course; Minutia; Plug-ins; Problem solving skills; Programming course; Programming language; Proposed architectures; Engineering; Problem oriented languages; Problem solving; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Wing, J., Computational thinking (2006) Communications of the ACM, 49 (3), pp. 33-35; Mayer, R.E., Dyck, J.L., Vilberg, W., Learning to program and learning to think: What's the connection?

Mahoe Dr, Palm Coast, FL 32137, United States; Wilcox, M.S., IBM Corporation, United States","This paper revisits success stories of past projects aimed at education transition through integrated curricula, multidisciplinary projects, and national/global technological issues. Successful programs depended heavily on interaction between educators and the professional engineers in the work force. Political priorities, both state and national, have played a major role in determining scope and success. Global issues are essential in most curricula since economic factors alone present major integrated components that engineers must understand. There are extraordinary opportunities, obstacles, and dangers ahead because we now are embroiled in the arena of ""knowledge management,"" where massive information interconnections are expanding among businesses, universities, and political systems. This will create problems of privacy, ethics, and value in the absence of an honest and rigorous work force. Although we have made great progress in electrical engineering curricular transitioning, there is much to do, as Dr. Vartan Gregorian (Carnegie Corp.) predicts: ""Laser communications, nuclear power, biotechnology, networked computers, and the like are precisely shaping our habits of thought and desire. They have become a dominant source of our culture, even to changing the very paradigms of knowledge. Rapidly evolving global communications are bringing social changes that are so complex and far-reaching they are not amenable to easy understanding."" As education moved into the 21st century, business and society in general recognized the significance of ""learning anywhere, anytime."" Enabled through the powerful mechanism of communications and networking, education and industry quickly recognized the need for a new trained work force. Education saw the extraordinary advantage of combining their faculty with visiting faculty from industry, forming an integrated and multidisciplinary team. Transforming Engineering Education has been led by electrical engineering departments with support from IEEE and corporations like IBM. During this historic transition, input from students became increasingly important as they examined new careers combining fields like engineering, medicine, health care, business, science, and management, to name a few. Lifelong learning has long been a core priority for IEEE and IBM. Lifelong learning and ""anywhere and anytime"" courses clearly will get better because they will have the support of an extraordinary, dynamic network that is the platform for implementation. Interactions between people and programs are expanding understanding of terms like ""knowledge management and computer simulations"" driven by common sense evaluations and the continual search for and emphasis on the meaning or role of ""wisdom"" in these gigantic digital warehouses of data. Michael Crichton continually reminds us of the fragility of networks susceptible to misuse or misdirection resulting in catastrophic consequences for society. In this paper, three transition-based programs are reviewed: 1. A long-term university/corporation agreement involving technical management and product research 2. Creation of a unique College of Integrated Science and Technology at James Madison University in Virginia 3. A major governor-sponsored West Virginia technology bill aimed at statewide support of economic development and educational change implemented under Senate Bill 547. These programs had in common the following goals: • for our students - the competitive advantage for the jobs of the future. • for our educators - the technological resources for uncompromised quality of content and access. ©2010 IEEE.","Anywhere, any time learning; Integrated science and technology; Integrated science and technology education; Integrated science college program; Knowledge management; Work force development","Anywhere, any time learning; Catastrophic consequences; Common sense; Competitive advantage; Digital warehouse; Dynamic network; Economic development; Economic factors; Engineering department; Global communication; Global issues; Integrated science college program; Laser communication; Life long learning; Multi-disciplinary teams; Multidisciplinary projects; Networked computers; Nuclear power; Political systems; Product research; Professional engineer; Science and Technology; Senate Bills; Social changes; Technical management; Technological resources; Virginia; West Virginia; Work force; Communication; Competition; Computer simulation; Curricula; Data warehouses; Electrical engineering; Engineers; Health care; Knowledge management; Management; Professional aspects; Students; Technology; Engineering education","Cleveland, H., (1985) The Knowledge Executive: Leadership in An Information Society, , E.P.

This inspired us to develop a Services Science Graduation Programme at the University of Twente, the Netherlands. We propose a study programme of five years, consisting of a Master phase of two years and a PhD phase of three years. This paper reports on our efforts to develop our Services Science Graduation Programme. Our approach in the development of this programme consisted of two phases: 1. we performed a survey of the programmes of other institutions in order to identify service concerns to be covered, but also patterns and strategies, and 2. we defined a programme with enough coverage, taking into consideration the local resources (course and lecturers) so that the programme can start immediately. In our survey we catalogued 386 courses offered in 35 programmes related to Services Science worldwide. The topics have been organised according to generic service activities, in an attempt to define the elements that should or could be covered by a Services Science programme.

Although the common wisdom is that large corporations invest the most money in new product R&D, the surprising fact is that most discontinuous innovations come from small firms, and most engineers in the US are employed by entrepreneurial firms as well. In spite of the centrality of entrepreneurial skills to engineering practice, most engineering curricula focus on teaching techniques that will enable students to ""build a better mousetrap,"" rather than to design for economic value. One way to rectify this situation is to push engineering curricula to be more entrepreneurial. The engineering curriculum of the future should include a series of courses designed to help engineers maximize both the entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial value of engineers. In partnership with business schools, engineering programs should design curricula that present a quantitatively rigorous and theoretically grounded approach to innovation. Central to this approach is the development of a market mentality that takes into account all of the relevant economic aspects of design, not simply relative advantage. ©2010 IEEE.","Business school; Cross discipline; Curriculum; Dual degree; Engineering education; Entrepreneurship; Joint degree; Non-technical skills","Business schools; Cross discipline; Dual degree; Entrepreneurship; Joint degree; Non-technical skills; Curricula; Design; Engineers; Innovation; Engineering education","Maintaining the Strength of Our Science & Engineering Capabilities (2004) Sustaining the Nation's Innovation Ecosystem, p. 2. , Washington DC: President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology; Innovate America Council on Competitiveness: National Innovation Initiative Summit, Washington, DC, 2005; Mandel, M.J., (2004) Rational Exuberance, , New York: HarperBusiness, This work summarizes the works of various economists.

These applications have allowed users to perform computations and calculations at levels of sophistication and depth that were not available to practitioners even one generation ago. They have also given educators the ability to convey advanced mathematical and engineering concepts in new ways and spend more time on analysis of engineering systems and less time on remedial mathematics. This new capability, which has become a fundamental tool for sophisticated designers in industry, is still not fully embraced in many engineering curricula. To exemplify the potential of scientific software in the engineering classroom, we describe a laboratory exercise conducted by second-year engineering students at Drexel University. It introduces a geosynchronous satellite orbital entry problem, and demonstrates how scientific software can help students understand the behavior of an interesting physical system in a way that would have required much more effort using traditional methods. We believe that early introduction to symbolic computation tools and scientific software would be very valuable to engineering students. Such tools should become standard instruments in the arsenal of present-day engineers. Moreover, their use should be adopted across the curriculum (not only in introductory mathematics classes) and become part of the design experience in all engineering disciplines. ©2010 IEEE.","Engineering education; Maple; MATHEMATICA; MATLAB; Scientific software; Symbolic computation","Design experience; Drexel University; Engineering classrooms; Engineering concepts; Engineering curriculum; Engineering design; Engineering disciplines; Engineering systems; Fundamental tools; Geosynchronous satellites; Laboratory exercise; Maple; Mathematica; Orbital entry; Physical systems; Scientific softwares; Symbolic computation; Curricula; Design; Geostationary satellites; Students; Engineering education","Beltzer, A.I., Shenkman, A.L., Use of symbolic computation in engineering education (1995) IEEE Transactions on Education, 38 (2), pp. 177-184. , May; http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/, MATLAB; http://www.maplesoft.com/Products/Maple/; http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html, MATHEMATICA; Alves, D.T., Amaral, J.V., Medeiros Neto, J.F., Cheb-Terrab, E.S., Learning Electromagnetism Via Programming and Symbolic Computation (2002) Revista Brasileira de Ensino de Física, 24 (2). , São Paulo, June; Pavlovi, M.N., Symbolic computation in structural engineering (2003) Computers & Structures, 81 (22-23), pp. 2121-2136. , September; Noinang, S., Wiwatanapataphee, B., Wu, Y.H., Teaching-learning Tool for Integral Calculs (2009) Far East Journal of Mathematical Education, 3 (3), pp. 203-212. , October; Røyrvik, O., Teacing Electrical Engineering using Maple (2002) International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 39 (4). , October; Shacham, M., Brauner, N., Ashurst, W.R., Cutlip, M.B., Can I Trust This Software Package?

As a consequence many South African engineering enterprises are implementing a ""servitization"" strategy in order to increase the institution's revenue stream. The global services economy is also extremely competitive and very volatile in nature and gaining a competitive advantage within this marketplace has very definite skills and cultural implications. This paper focuses on the skills and organisational culture implications in managing the transition from a manufacturing to a services dominant operational setting. The methodology used in conducting the research study, in the first instance, entailed the undertaking of a literature research to gain an understanding of the skills and cultural aspects involved in managing such a transition. In the second instance use was made of a case study undertaken at a South African enterprise that had undergone a servitization process. A correlation between theory and practice was undertaken and the skills implications involved were then also analysed with reference to the prevailing South African business environment to evaluate the consequences of the research findings from a national skills development perspective. The methodology use is consequently analytical-descriptive and thus qualitative in nature. Important findings emanating from the research is that the servitization process has a very definite organizational culture implication and the skills set required by managers and staff needs to be extended in scope to capture the multi-disciplinary nature of the services economy. ©2010 IEEE.","Organizational culture; Servitization; South African dual manufacturing and services economy; T-shaped people skills","Business environments; Competitive advantage; Cultural aspects; Dominant orientation; Engineering enterprise; Global services; Multi-disciplinary; Organisational culture; Organizational cultures; Research studies; Revenue streams; Servitization; Skills development; South African dual manufacturing and services economy; T-shaped people skills; Theory and practice; Competition; Economics; Quality assurance; Reliability analysis; Research; Engineering education","Anderson, Blaine, S., (2010) Results 'Bad News for Engineering', , http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=90862, Business day: Available online: [8 January 2010]; Baines, T.S., Lightfoot, H.W., Evans, S., Neely, A., Greenough, R., Peppard, J., Roy, R., Wilson, H., State-of-the-art in product-service systems (2007) IMechE, 221, pp. 1543-1552; (2009), http://www.producao.ufrgs.br/arquivos/disciplinas/ 187_exemplo_artigo_revisao_estado_da_arte_pss.pdf, Available online: 9 January; Buera, F.J., Kaboski, J.P., (2009) The Rise of the Services Economy, , National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), working paper 14822, Cambridge MA, March 2009; Camuti, P.A., Engineering the future: Staying competitive in the global economy (2006) Online Journal for Global Engineering Education, 1 (1), pp. 1-6. , http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/oigee, 5 July; Cilliers, P., (1998) Complexity and Postmodernism: Understanding Complex System, , New York : Routledge; Siemens tackles South Africa's skills shortage (2007) Data Week, , http://www.dataweek.co.za/article.aspx?pklArticleId=4375& pklCategoryId=31, Available online: 6 January; D'Agostino, V., Create a Customer-Service Culture (2009) Business Week, , http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/tips/archives/2007/11/ create_a_custom.html, 26 November.

Face-to face and online is the chosen method of instruction. It is well recognized that engineering technologists generally have a very strong background in technical skills at the time of graduation. However, they are imparted little education related to organizational management, entrepreneurship, finance, project management, product quality and development etc. These skills form the crux of entrepreneurship and are highly sought after in any workplace. Demonstrably, the absence of aforementioned skills in a technology curriculum is a great disservice to students. This paper describes how this crucial need was addressed through the development of a master's program in engineering management that includes several dual numbered courses that can be taken by graduate as well as undergraduate students. The curriculum for said program is multi-disciplinary. It builds on faculty expertise in diverse disciplines such as safety, product development, Quality and Engineering Economy. Communication skills are enhanced in every course through writing a project report and presenting findings. Issues such as technology transfer are also woven into the fabric of this program. Program overview, effectiveness as well as salient features are presented. ©2010 IEEE.","Communication; Cross-disciplinary; Management and business; Non-technical skills; Technology transfer","Business and management; Communication skills; Cross-disciplinary; Cross-disciplinary program; Engineering economy; Engineering management; Engineering technologists; Engineering technology students; Management skills; Multi-disciplinary; Non-technical skills; Organizational management; Product quality; Project reports; Salient features; Technical skills; Technology curricula; Undergraduate students; Curricula; Engineering; Engineers; Management science; Product development; Project management; Students; Teaching; Technology transfer; Engineering education","Harry, M.J., Schroeder, R., (2006) Six Sigma: The Breakthrough Management Strategy Revolutionizing the World's Top Corporations, , Doubleday Business; Quality Function Deployment, , http://www.itioh.com/Services/Planning.htm, Internet link; Pande, P., Holpp, L., (2002) What Is Six Sigma?, , McGraw Hill, NY; George, M., (2003) Lean Six Sigma for Service: How to Use Lean Speed and Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions, , McGraw Hill, NY; Eckes, G., (2003) Six Sigma for Everyone, , John Wiley and Sons, NJ; Schonberger, R., (2008) Best Practices in Lean Six Sigma Process Improvement: A Deeper Look, , John Wiley and Sons, NJ","Desai, A.; Mechanical Engineering Tech.and Engineering Management, , Statesboro, GA 30458, United States; email: adesai@georgiasouthern.edu",,9781424460427,,"English","IEEE Transforming Eng.

This transformation is especially challenging in the context of major research institutions with longstanding traditions of high quality engineering education. This paper presents a model for engineering education reform through an ongoing initiative within the College of Engineering at University of Illinois. Factors such as institutional resistance to transformation are considered and potential solutions are offered. The paper explores the power of pilot programs aimed at encouraging freshmen student involvement, development, and interaction. Consideration is given to implementation issues, and scalability within the context of the current pilot program. A focus on student leadership development and learning is presented within the program framework. Discussion of the role that upper level undergraduates and graduate students play in the operation of the program is also presented. Preliminary efficacy of the program and its future at the University of Illinois will be discussed. Upcoming challenges for the model will be considered with a primary focus on the challenges inherent in a program that relies heavily on student leadership and engagement.

It is, therefore, a real project carried out by students in which they themselves assume responsibilities and, hence, perform an active role in their own learning process always following the guidelines set by the professor, who designs specific activities or recreates scenarios accordingly. Thereby, in the present article we explain how a group of students assess PBL methodology in their tuition and practice and, especially, when carrying out and finishing a set project. Our contribution, then, goes a step further than usual as it deals with more than just filling up questionnaires and gathering opinions but it incorporates students' views on the methodological tools used both in the theoretical and practical sessions which offers us, professors, a very useful inside information of students' perceptions an views while using PBL for their Engineering project. ©2010 IEEE.","Active methodologies; Problem-Based Learning (PBL); Project-Based Learning (PBL); Teaching quality and student's view","Active methodologies; Engineering project; Industrial organization; Learning process; Methodological tools; Practical sessions; Problem based learning; Project based learning; Real projects; Specific activity; Teaching quality and student's view; Engineering education; Problem solving; Students","Sarin, S., Quality assurance in engineering education: A comparison of EC-2000 and ISO-9000 (2000) International Jornal of Engineering Education, 89 (4), pp. 495-501; Volkwein, J.F., Lattuca, L.R., Tenerzini, P.T., Strauss, L.C., Javzan, S., Ingineering change: A study if the impact of EC2000 International Journal of Engineering Education, 20 (3), pp. 318-328. , 004; Ponsa, P., Amante, B., Roman, J.A., Olivier, S., Díaz, M., Vives, J., Higher Education Challenges: Introduction of Active Methodologies in Engineering Curricula (2009) International Journal of Engineering Education, 25 (4), pp. 799-813; Ramos, F., Espinosa, E., A self-learning environment base don the PBL approach:an application to the learning process in the field of robotics and manufacturing systems (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education., 19 (5), pp. 754-758; Duch, B.J., Groh, S.E., Allen, D.E., (2001) The Power of Problem-based Learning, , Stylus publishing; Barà, J., (2003) Aprendizaje Basado en Problemas / Proyectos: ¿Qué, Por Qué, Cómo?, , institut de ciències de l'educació, julio; Sanchez, F.J., Cooperative learning in the digital electronics course at the epsc-upc International Conference on Engineering Education, Icee03, Valencia, Spain (2003); Jiménez, G., Jiménez, A., Senhadji, R., Sevillano, J.L., Linares, A., Rodríguez, M.A., Aprendizaje por proyectos en la enseñanza de los microcontroladores 17 CUIEET - Congreso Universitario de Innovación Educativa en Las Enseñanzas Técnicas.

However, there is still a major gap in being able to sustain this kind of excitement - being able to provide an immersive hands-on learning experience throughout the tenure of a student's time in engineering. This gap becomes apparent when we consider that a student only spends one-fifths of their time in the lab as compared to a staggering three-fifths of their time doing their homework. However today, apart from some grass root efforts there is not much emphasis to introduce hands-on project based learning as part of a student's homework experience - primarily because of the lack of affordable technologies. In this paper, we will explore Project based learning advances in both undergraduate engineering classes like introduction to engineering and senior or capstone design as well as the pipeline that feeds into the university space, the high school programs. We will then make the case for need for project based learning in the dorm room, and what the requirements are to enable educators to make experiments scalable to the dorm room. We will also look at an implementation from Georgia Tech and the lessons learned from their experiment as well as look at some technologies that lend themselves to dorm-room based experiments.","Dorm-room; Hands-on PBL; Homeworks; Interactive learning; myDAQ; Project-based learning; Student-ownership","Dorm-room; Hands-on PBL; Homeworks; Interactive learning; myDAQ; Project based learning; Engineering; Experiments; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Thomas, J.W., (2000) A Review of Research on Project-Based Learning, , San Rafael, CA: Autodesk Foundation; Frank, M., Lavy, I., Elata, D., Implementing the project-based learning approach in an academic engineering course (2003) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 13, pp. 273-288; Blumenfeld, P.C., Soloway, E., Marx, R.W., Krajcik, J.S., Guzdial, M., Palinscar, A., Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning (1991) Educational Psychologist, 26 (3-4), pp. 369-398; Özdener, N., Özçoban, T., A project based learning model's effectiveness on computer courses and multiple intelligence theory (2004) Educational Sciences: Theory & Practice, 4 (1); Guo, J., Using group-based projects to improve retention of students in computer science major (2008) J.

The education system has been designed to produce 'good employees' rather than 'good entrepreneurs'. The educators at Shoubra Faculty of Engineering, SFE, realized the drop in the capabilities of the students regarding business aspects and cross platforms. SFE arranged two 3- full day programs addressed to last year students (year 4) in all engineering departments. The objective of the program was to prepare students to possess entrepreneurial skills in order to plan, run a small business and serve the community, thus complementing the academic education.

In this paper, the meaning of sustainable engineering education is broadened to include the sustainability of the individual engineer over his or her lifetime. This paper proposes that there are two fundamental questions to be answered, one about the learning process within the engineering student (i.e. What is the student doing when learning engineering?), and one about the engineering community which is seeking to make that learning most effective (i.e. What collaborative structures within the engineering education community will lead to the most effective cumulative progress, both in the education of individual students, and in the enterprise of engineering in its widest sense within the history of humanity?) This paper provides preliminary answers to these questions in line with human cognitive models, and demonstrates that ""understanding understanding"" across engineering disciplines allows elements of sustainability to be introduced in engineering education (examples are given from electrical and computer engineering.) These answers point to a framework for change in engineering education, one which extends to collaboration between engineering and economics, law, business, and other sectors. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Cognitive model; Collaborative structures; Electrical and computer engineering; Engineering community; Engineering disciplines; In-line; Learning process; Sustainable engineering; Education computing; Models; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Engineering education","Allen, D., Allenby, B., Bridges, M., Crittenden, J., Davidson, C., Hendrickson, C., Matthews, S., Pijawka, D., (2008) Benchmarking Sustainable Engineering Education: Final Report, , www.csengin.org/benchmark.htm, Carnegie Mellon University, Available; (2009) Engineering a Sustainable Society: Strategic Plan 2009-2014, , www.eng.mcmaster.ca/strategicplan/StrategicPlan.pdf, Faculty of Engineering, Available; Lucky, R., Engineering achievements: The two lists (2009) IEEE Spectrum, 46 (11), p. 23. , Nov; (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering, Washington, DC: National Academies Press; (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering, Washington, DC: National Academies Press; (2008) Accreditation Criteria and Procedures, , www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pu_ab.cfm, Engineers Canada, Available; Shepherd, S.D., Pellegrino, J.W., Olds, B.M., On becoming a 21st century engineer (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3). , (Guest Editor's Foreword, Special Issue on Educating Future Engineers: Who, What, and How), July; Moloney, C., Thinking yourself into a scientist or engineer Royal Society of Canada Conference, Rooms of Their Own: Women in the Knowledge Economy and Society, Edmonton, AB, May 2-4 2007, , presented at; Moloney, C., Reading, doing, and communicating DSP IEEE Newfoundland Electrical and Computer Engineering Conference (NECEC) 2008, St. John's, NL, Nov 2008, , presented at; Moloney, C., Language, learning, and leadership: The dynamics of women in science Symposium for Women Entering Ecology and Evolution Today (SWEEET) of the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution, Halifax, NS, May 2009, , invited plenary presentation at; Rogoff, B., Observing sociocultural activity on three planes: Participatory appropriation, guided participation, and apprenticeship (1995) Sociocultural Studies of Mind, pp. 139-164. , J.V.

With reference to accreditation criteria and new concepts of engineers, we review models of intellectual development (e.g. Perry and Baxter Magolda) and consider the overlap of various stages within these models. To explore how students might move from stage to stage, we consider the ""disruptive"" and ""anti-foundational"" pedagogies of Mezirow and Butin as ways to help students learn to appreciate ""other"" ways of perceiving the world and of co-constructing knowledge. In the course, students are introduced to strategies of Problem Oriented Learning (POL) through humanitarian case studies involving socio-technical problems identified by three communities in India. Attention to the concept of community and the complexity of social context becomes critical, as students learn to develop a tolerance for ambiguity and, through the instrument of critical reflection, shift the starting point for their research from the technical problem itself to its larger social context(s). ©2010 IEEE.","Community based research; Global citizenship; Humanitarian case studies; Interdisciplinary learning environments; Problem-oriented learning; Socio-technical problems; Transformative learning","Community based research; Global citizenship; Humanitarian case studies; Interdisciplinary learning environments; Problem-oriented learning; Sociotechnical; Transformative learning; Accreditation; Curricula; Education computing; Research; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","C.

To be hired and capable to keep the job the today and future engineer must demonstrate innovative skills or, in more general terms, to be resourceful. This 10 years long study presents the results of training of two groups of electrical engineering students selected each academic year to develop design projects. The requirement of each two semester long project is to develop novel circuitry (amplifiers, switches, etc.) or novel component (transistor, photodetector, etc.). Both groups were provided with commercial design packages. The difference however is that students of one group were supported by internships and worked at the sites of electronic companies and the other group was supported by university research assistantships. Every year based on scholastic achievements 10-15 students were selected for the project oriented course. Students were given the freedom to select a project topic.

The overarching program goal is graduation of a new pedigree of qualified engineers with the ""soft skills"", business acumen and strategic foresight, in addition to engineering prowess, to meet the needs of industry in the 21st century. Following the recommendation from James Duderstadt's ""Engineering for a Changing World"" [1], we propose a new paradigm for the education of the engineering leaders of the 21st century. The Duderstadt model mirrors the medical school training model that is credited with propelling advancement in medical practice during the last century, where the BS degree includes a broad-based curriculum of engineering design, project management, technology, ingenuity and innovation, along with business, communication, ethics, and social sciences. This foundation is then followed by post-graduate study, via a professional Master's degree program, in a specific discipline or concentration. The Leadership Engineering degree program is a first important, and viable, step towards that new paradigm. A large fraction of the graduates of the Leadership Engineering program are anticipated to pursue professional graduate degrees in a variety of engineering fields. Through a curriculum that provides a framework for building successful businesses, students graduating from the program may also move into the booming technology services sector or choose to start their own innovative companies.

While there is some movement in engineering education to change that, this change is not easy, as it involves a cultural change from the silo approach to a holistic approach. The ABET-required senior capstone multidisciplinary design course too often becomes a design-build-test exercise with the emphasis on just getting something done. Students rarely break out of their disciplinary comfort zone and thus fail to experience true multidisciplinary system design. What is needed are multidisciplinary systems courses, with a balance between theory and practice, between academic rigor and the best practices of industry, presented in an integrated way in the 2 nd and 3rd years that prepares students for true multidisciplinary systems engineering at the senior level and beyond. The two courses presented here represent a significant curriculum improvement in response to this urgent need. ©2010 IEEE.","Discovery learning; Innovation and integration; Multidisciplinary systems engineering","Best-practices; Comfort zone; Competitive advantage; Cultural changes; Curriculum improvement; Design build; Discovery learning; Global economies; Holistic approach; Multi-disciplinary designs; Multi-disciplinary systems; Multidisciplinary engineering; Multidisciplinary systems engineering; Theory and practice; Undergraduate engineering educations; Competition; Curricula; Design; Innovation; Students; Systems engineering; Teaching; Engineering education",,"Craig, K.; College of Engineering, , Milwaukee, WI, United States",,9781424460427,,"English","IEEE Transforming Eng.

The interaction of technology, business, human values, and complexity to achieve innovation is directly experienced by students through the application of the engineering system design process to real-world problems. The students embrace a new attitude towards learning and knowledge. They are expected to come prepared for class, ready to learn and dynamically interact. Faculties have a new attitude towards teaching, mentoring students, and addressing different learning styles: kinesthetic, aural, visual, and written. Active, integrative, inquiry-guided teaching is becoming the norm.

One of the key engineering education issues is curriculum adaptability to the growing regional needs as the countries evolve through their developmental process. This is usually dictated by the national infrastructure program development plans. In most cases, the electrical engineering curriculum for example is usually centered on power construction given the national need and evolves to include controls and communications. The civil engineering curriculum equally revolves around structures and surveying.

The common term for these skills is ""soft skills"" and they include cross-cultural, legal awareness, language, entrepreneurship, ethical, political, management, economic, and interpersonal skills. While we have an ad-hoc approach to teaching some skills, we do have a systematic well established and continually assessed approach to teaching others. We have developed courses, lectures, and small programs to support learning and enhancing these skills.

All homework assignments were part of a large narrative story with a protagonist that has many adventures, and during his adventures, he must ask for help from his friend. The friend is, of course, the student doing the homework. This provides a context and targeted audience for the students' writing, makes the student feel like their work is part of a larger coherent whole, situates the specific skills necessary in doing the homework, and results in the students directing their dislike of the assignment at the protagonist of the story rather than at the instructor. In doing this, students develop writing skills (as they write answers to questions from the story's protagonist) which are different in nature than what they would in an assignment in which they were asked to ""show your work""; these writing skills more closely approximate the communication skills that these technical students would need to communicate with a nontechnical audience. Integrating the large narrative story within the context of popular culture references, previous and future assignments, and allowing for it to build up suspense and tension with regard to the coming assignments and topics provides a continuity of instructional flow which is advantageous to retaining students' interest. This integration also helps with the education of various other non-technical skills as students learn to see their work in the larger human context of what they are doing through the use of the continually running narrative which holds the course together. In this paper I will describe this approach in detail, provide examples of how this approach was used, and provide survey results from students regarding the effectiveness of the approach in accomplishing the aforementioned items. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Communication skills; Computer literacy; Digital logic; Homework assignments; Human context; Innovative approaches; Introductory course; Non-technical skills; Writing skills; Computer science; Curricula; Engineering education; Integration; Surveys; Teaching; Students",,"Chen, A.; Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, , Moorhead, MN 56563, United States; email: chenan@mnstate.edu",,9781424460427,,"English","IEEE Transforming Eng.

Recent studies have indicated that engineering knowledge doubles every 10 years. The time constraints of the existing learning frame towards a B.Sc. degree, does not allow for the inclusion of all the accumulated experience in high-tech industries within the engineering curriculum, not to mention predicted needs of new upcoming knowledge. Therefore, many researchers believe that new graduates should be equipped with more professional skills, at the expense of knowledge content. Development of cognitive engineering skills in the course of studies toward a B.Sc. degree can assist the student in the difficult transition from academia to industry. Such cultivation of engineering thinking may reduce the gap between knowledge and skills acquired by the novice graduate and market demands. This approach may serve as leverage for the future success of the student. Internship is an obligatory requirement in the Department of EEE of the Academic College for Engineering ORT Braude. This article reviews 15 years experience implementing internship at more than 150 hi-tech plants and research institutes. More than 500 graduates experienced the process of engineering design during the course of their internship. This article presents the results of a longitudinal study of students' skills and attitudes with respect to the internship process. Furthermore, engineering thinking development of students while performing their first engineering design project in industry was also investigated. We concentrated on the following questions: • What are the main characteristics of engineering thinking that are expressed by students during their final project? • What roles do these characteristics play during the process of the project? Qualitative research methodology was applied based on the analysis of the interviews and monthly and final project reports. The findings demonstrate that the industrial environment forces the learner to find practical solutions, while developing systems thinking, reflective thinking and real problem solving.. Creative and algorithmic routine thinking have also emerged in engineering thinking. This study aims to contribute significantly to the accumulated knowledge about engineering thinking and its development among engineering students in the course of their internship project. ©2010 IEEE.","Characterization of engineering design thinking; Engineering design thinking; Internship","Cognitive engineering; Electronic engineering; Engineering curriculum; Engineering design; Engineering design projects; Engineering design thinking; Engineering knowledge; Hi-tech; High-tech industries; Industrial environments; Internship; Knowledge content; Longitudinal study; Main characteristics; Market demand; Practical solutions; Professional skills; Project reports; Qualitative research; Reflective thinking; Research institutes; Systems thinking; Technological development; Theory and practice; Time constraints; Curricula; Design; Industry; Knowledge engineering; Research; Students; Teaching; Technological forecasting; Engineering education","Simon, H.A., (1996) The Science of the Artificial, , 3rd ed., Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Dym, C.L., Agogino, A.M., Eris, O., Frey, D.D., Leifer, L.J., Engineering Design Thinking, Teaching, and Learning (2005) J.

An excellent mechanism with which to achieve this goal is to use systems engineering and project management as teaching modules and in metacognitive fashion. This can be done in different ways, but a common thread is required over the period of the engineering course. As a result, students are exposed to engineering skills such as requirements analysis and management, specification practices, behavioral analysis, and project management. Systems engineering, when applied properly, draws together all aspects of engineering, including human, legal, economic, environmental, and other requirements, while project management draws together interpersonal skills.

According to many researchers and academics, it gives profoundly beneficial results for engineering education as a result of the features it incorporates. Success of any application is closely related with how the application is perceived. This study assesses a Project Based Learning (PBL) environment designed as a short course based on student perceptions. The study was dealt with as a qualitative research methodology and designed as a case study. Data gathered as a result of the study was dissolved with descriptive analysis. As a result of the study it was determined that students believe that this approach has provided benefits for them in the issues of bringing in responsibility, increasing their motivation, learning deeply, learning by doing (experiencing), applying theoretical knowledge in practice, improving their problem solving skills, seeing real-world problems, being informed about their own learning styles, improving the feeling of self-confidence, performing time and project management effectively. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Circuit design for VLSI course; Engineering education; Project Based Learning (PBL); Short course",,"Hiscocks, P.D., (2009) Project-Based-Learning: Outcomes Descriptions and Design, , http://www.syscompdesign.com/AppNotes/pbl.pdf, Accessed 15-Feb; Esche, S.K., Project-Based Learning (PBL) in a course on mechanisms and dynamics (2002) World Transactions on Engineering and Technology Education, 1 (2), pp. 201-204; Thomas, J.W., (2000) A Review of Research on Project-Based Learning, , http://www.bobpearlman.org/BestPractices/PBL_Research.pdf, Accessed 14-Feb-2009; Blumenfeld, P.C., Soloway, E., Max, R.W., Krajcik, J., Guzdial, M., Palincsar, A., Motivating project-based learning: Sustaining the doing, supporting the learning (1991) Educational Psychologist, 26 (3-4), p. 369; Kjiersdam, F., Enemark, S., (1994) The Aalborg Experiment-Project Innovation in University Education, , Aalborg University Press, Aalborg, DK; (2004) The Aalborg PBL model-Progress, Diversity and Challenges, , A.

We will also discuss the results in terms of applications for engineering education. There were 192 undergraduate engineering students who volunteered to participate in this study. First, they completed a questionnaire to measure the best predictors of students' engagement and persistence in their respective programs. Second, we met with 15 students who volunteered to participate in interviews. Results from the questionnaire show that the best predictor in both programs regarding students' engagement and persistence is the provided 'support,' which reduces stress. Results from the interviews reveal that the support most effective for students proves to be the stable learning environment (PBL tutoring sessions) as well as the scaffolding measures for managing time and organizing learning practices. Taking into consideration the results from both the questionnaire and the interviews, it appears essential to limit these risks by taking measures that will reduce stress factors and increase strong support. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Engagement; Engineering education; Innovation; Persistence; Problem-based learning; Project-based learning",,"Béchard, J.-P., Béchard, D., Quand l'innovation pédagogique s'insère dans le curriculum (2009) Innover Dans L'enseignement Supérieur, pp. 45-60. , In D.

However, introductory physics courses often have little connection to the real world of engineering. Our work proposes a way towards meeting this objective: first, by a carefully planed curriculum, which must clearly inter-relate the desired learning outcomes with contextualized real-world tasks, and aligned with the students' assessment; second, by a careful mediation of the students' learning in the classroom, stimulating a healthy social learning environment, where students develop real work and overcome natural difficulties in order to construct their knowledge and develop the intended competences and abilities. This work took place in a Portuguese Polytechnic School of Engineering during four years; the results point to an incremental improvement, not only in the historically low pass rates, but also in students' satisfaction. In those classes where teacher mediation was varied and more significantly used to address the needs in students' learning, the results point also to the development of higher level competences. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Introductory physics; Students' competences; Students' learning; Teacher mediation",,"Valverde-Albacete, F.J., Pedraza-Jiméez, R., Molina-Bulla, H., Cid-Sueiro, J., Díaz-Pérez, P., Navia-vázquez intermediactor: An environment for instructional content design based on competences (2003) Educational Technology & Society, 6, pp. 30-47; Felder, R.M., Woods, D.R., Stice, J.E., Rugarcia, A., The Future of Engineering Education II.

Using process and outcome-oriented assessment methods, we introduced an assessment scheme that addresses all eleven outcomes of EAC 3 in engineering and contains individual and group assessment. The present article aims to expose and present difficulties of group assessment with 'problem projects' integrated in the assessment scheme. 'Problem projects' could provide an objective picture of individual student's knowledge, skills and progress if they are used in combination with other assessment elements from the scheme. The assessment scheme was used in an experiment, where PBL and traditional instruction were compared in an introductory statistics course. In the experiment, significant difference in students' achievements across 'problem projects' was observed. Despite difficulties in assessment the results encouraged us to use PBL also in other subjects. © 2010 TEMPUS Publications.","Assessment; Engineering education; Evaluation of teaching method; Problem-based learning",,"Woods, D.R., (1996) Problem-based learning: How to gain the most from PBL, , Hamilton: McMaster University; Perrenet, J.C., Bouhuijs, P.A.J., Smits, J.G.M.M., The suitability of problem-based learning for engineering education: Theory and practice (2000) Teach.

Carbon tax, carbon pollution reduction schemes, emissions trading legislation are paving the way for environmental accountability in engineering industry. Engineering education moves into the twenty first century charged with an environmental agenda due to response to wider changes in society. Educators are regularly modifying curriculum content to embrace sustainability in learning outcomes. However this crosses over between a number of multi-disciplinary, multidimensional study areas that include philosophy and ethics. Consequently a major challenge for educators is to encourage engineering students whose primary focus is purely technical to include sustainability viewpoint in their designs. Unlike technical or financial evaluations where measures are either empirical or numerical estimates, sustainability position includes criteria in economic, natural, social, technological and time indicators. For the most part sustainability evaluations are content and competency driven and rely sometimes on rather intangible and proximal criteria. These criteria form the basis of assessment for measuring the sustainability of a design. The purpose of this article is to present various criterion, and indicators available to evaluate sustainability in engineering designs feasibility assessments. The paper presents the application of sustainability design criteria in the context of capstone design projects by way of applying social, economic, ecological, technological and time SEETT framework. These criteria form the basis of sustainability education embedment in engineering capstone design projects. Finally this paper argues the thesis that Sustainability feasibility studies and assessment in capstone engineering design projects are of grave importance for the success of the new frontier. © 2010 IEEE.","Assessment feasibilty; Capstone; Criteria; Design; Engineering eduction model; Indicator; New century; Sustainbility","Assessment feasibilty; Capstone design projects; Capstone Engineering; Carbon pollution; Carbon taxes; Design criterion; Design Engineering; Emissions Trading; Engineering design; Engineering industries; Environmental agendas; Feasibility assessment; Feasibility studies; Financial evaluation; Learning outcome; Multi-disciplinary; Study areas; Sustainability education; Air quality; Curricula; Design; Education computing; Emission control; Laws and legislation; Philosophical aspects; Sustainable development; Engineering education","Annarego, J., Clarke, S., Problem-based design studios for undergraduate SE education (2005) 18th Conference on Software Engineering Education & Training (CSEET05), pp. 249-254; Vanasupa, L., Splitt, F.G., Curricula for A Sustainable Future: A proposal for integrating environmental concepts into our curricula (2009) Materials Research Society, , Warrendale, PA; Fokkema, J., Jansen, L., Mulder, K., Sustainability: Necessity for a prosperous society (2005) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 6, pp. 219-228; Fenner, R.A., Ainger, C.M., Cruickshank, H.J., Guthrie, P.M., Embedding sustainable development at Cambridge university engineering department (2005) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 6, pp. 229-241; Lundholm, C., Learning about environmental issues Postgraduate and undergraduate students' interpretations of environmental contents in education (2005) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 6, pp. 242-253; Lourdel, N., Gondran, N., Laforest, V.R., Debray, B., Brodhag, C., Sustainable development cognitive map: A new method of evaluating student understanding (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8, pp. 170-182; Paten, C.J.K., Palousis, N., Hargroves, K., Smith, M., Engineering sustainable solutions program.

It has long been recognized that the most effective learning techniques involve direct, purposeful learning experiences, such as hands-on or field experiences. In particular, computer-controlled models have been a useful aid in teaching programming, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics concepts. This paper describes our experience using LEGO Mindstorms®in three different scenarios: an elementary course on Programming, an advanced-level course on Artificial Intelligence and a third first-level course on Robotics. Our focus in those experiments is not on whether using LEGO kits is better than other methods to learn a programming language, AI algorithms or Robotics, but rather on introducing how this mixture of collaboration, competition and peer learning in a laboratory environment helps the students to increase their motivation and improve their professional skills such as problem solving, team work and leadership. © 2010 IEEE.","Active learning; Assessment; Empirical results; Engineering courses; Evaluation; Java programming; Learning experiences; LEGO Mindstorms; Surveys","Active Learning; Empirical results; Engineering course; Evaluation; Java programming; LEGO mindstorms; Computer control systems; Computer software selection and evaluation; Education computing; Engineering; Engineering education; Java programming language; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Surveys; Learning algorithms","Anderson, J., (2009) Edgar Dale's Cone of Experience Media, , http://www.edutechie.ws/2007/10/09/cone-of-experience-media/, online: visited 11/8; (2009) Career Space Curriculum Guidelines, , http://www.scribd.com/doc/2971342/Career-Space-Curriculum- GuidelinesGuidelines, on-line: visited 1/11; (2009) Skills for Europe's Future: Anticipating Occupational Skill Needs, , http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/etv/Infomation_resources/Bookshop/ publication_details.asp?pub_id=538, visited 1/11; (2009) Official.

Without a steady improvement in quality the teaching levels in our universities' will decline due to the more complex context of today's universities. Unfortunately, professors who work hard to improve and innovate in engineering education find their work to be unappreciated by their colleagues and superiors. Engineering education is considered as something that overenthusiastic professors do 'on the side' and instead of 'real' research. In this paper we analyze the professional associations related with engineering education, as well as the conferences, symposia and journals on the field, and show that by the typical measurable standards, Engineering Education is at the same level as any other technical engineering field. © IEEE.","Education research; Educational technology; Engineering education","Education research; Educational technology; Professional associations; Technical engineering; Research; Standards; Technical presentations; Engineering education","Alberich, R., Miró, J., ""La colaboración en el Jenui revisited: La convergencia europea"".

While these important initiatives are taking place, it is useful to analyze existing archival data to get a sense of students' understanding of technology. Such archival data exists from the entries submitted to the Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVisions competition conducted during the past 15 years. Although these data are from a targeted population of K-12 students (those who entered the competition), it does provide some baseline data about students' views and understanding of technology. The analysis of this data reflects which technologies students chose to study and explore for the competition. In forecasting what these technologies may be like in 20 years, students also revealed what they saw as the positive and negative consequences of their chosen technologies. In addition, in their descriptions of their design process, they revealed what factors drove them to reject certain design choices. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Design; ExploraVisions; Technological literacy; Technology competition; Technology education","Design; Population statistics; Students; Baseline data; Design process; ExploraVisions; Retrospective analysis; Students' views; Technological literacy; Technology competitions; Technology education; Engineering education","(1993) Benchmarks for Science Literacy, , AAAS American Association for the Advancement of Science, New York: Oxford University Press; Compton, V.J., Harwood, C.D., Progression in technology education in New Zealand: Components of practice as a way forward (2005) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 15, pp. 253-287; Copp, N.H., Zanella, A.W., (1993) Discovery Innovation, and Risk, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; (2000) Using Authentic Assessment in Vocational Education, , Custer, R.

""It transcends time and place, as well as all manners of people"". In this paper, we present a study and a framework proposal for a mixed collaborative-competitive learning environment, applied to a programming course in a University level engineering program. While neither collaboration, nor competition, is inherently good or bad in supporting the learning process, the way teachers employ these strategies in classrooms determines their value in preparing ""soon-to-be"" professionals. We believe this mixed-based learning approach best serves students as they are able to achieve academic success both in working with others and on an individual basis. Besides the traditional theoretical lessons and laboratory practices of the course, the integration of the framework automates all the support and evaluation processes. It implements both an individual competitive setting and a collaborative one, where intergroup competition occurs, by means of two interconnected modules. We discuss our results and findings in its preliminary use, concluding that the framework promises to have a good impact in the way we teach some programming courses in our Institute. © 2010 IEEE.","Automated evaluation framework; Collaborative learning; Competitive learning; Programming language innovation","Automated evaluation; Collaborative learning; Competitive learning; Engineering program; Evaluation process; Interconnected modules; Laboratory practices; Learning approach; Learning process; Programming course; University levels; C (programming language); Competition; Computer software selection and evaluation; Interoperability; Linguistics; Teaching; Engineering education","Graham, P.J., The competitive emphasis of sport: A need for reflection (1976) The International Congress of Physical Activity Sciences, , Paper presented at Quebec City, Quebec, Canada; Ediger, M., Cooperative learning versus competition: Which one is better?

In the present work, we develop an application of the derivative concept to optimize the Altering of a colour image. This implies to optimize the value of the filter parameter to maximize performance. We propose to maximize the quality of the filtered image represented by the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), which is a function of the filter parameter. The optimal value for the parameter is obtained by means of an algorithm based on the approximation of the derivative of the PSNR function so that finally the optimum filtered image is obtained. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Colour image; Filter parameter; Filtered images; Function Optimization; Optimal values; Peak signal to noise ratio; Approximation algorithms; Electric converters; Optimization; Signal to noise ratio; Engineering education","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model; González, R.C., Woods, R.E., (2002) Digital Image Processing, , Prentice Hall; Plataniotis, K.N., Venetsanopoulos, A.N., (2000) Color Image Processing and Applications, , Springer-Verlag; Perona, P., Malik, J., Scale-space and edge detection using anisotropic diffusion (1990) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 12 (7), pp. 629-639. , DOI 10.1109/34.56205; Tomasi, C., Manduchi, R., Bilateral filter for gray and color images (1998) Proc.

During 14 laboratory weekly sessions of 2 h, students must analyze and design the analog and digital circuitry for an ultrasound-based distance measurement system, by means of several guided practices. Small groups of two or three students worked on a collaborative way, while the teacher acted as a guide to facilitate project comprehension and knowledge acquisition. The experience we describe corresponds to the Spring term of 2009, a period in which this methodology was applied to two small class groups of about 23 and 7 students respectively. This work studies the influence of the initial characteristics of the students and their time devoted to prepare the subject, on their academic performance.

However, the growth of this data repository makes it difficult to find information of value, and reduces the possibilities of sharing and exchanging resources. Using semantic technologies to describe educational resources enables any agent (human or software-based) to process and understand its content (applying inference rules on more structured knowledge). Metadata standards can be used to annotate educational resources; they facilitate their interoperability and discovery. In this work, we propose, OER-CC ontology, for the description of Open Educational Resources under Creative Commons Licenses. This approach is based on standard technology and metadata standards.

All the basics courses in the first and second semester have been taught as part of projects and involve teamwork. Modern engineering students are difficult to motivate in order to learn pure theoretical issues such as solving differential equations. Especially when we talk about undergraduate engineering students, who do not expect to continue their education higher than a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. At the same time, and for the same reason, the fail rate in mathematics is very high during the first two semesters. This was the reason we decided to change the structure of our education and incorporate the theory with practical projects. This paper describes some of the projects. The projects are the motivating factors to learn mathematics. The examination results show improved learning potential, when using this method of engineering education. The students' evaluations show a very positive effect on their experience with this ""practical"" way of learning theory. At the same time, the evaluation results have shown higher pass rates and higher grading. © 2010 IEEE.","Motivation; Project based learning; Teamwork","Bachelor of science in engineerings; Copenhagen; Denmark; Electronic engineering; Evaluation results; Learning potential; Learning Theory; Modern engineering; Pass rate; Positive effects; Project based learning; Team work; Undergraduate engineering students; Differential equations; Engineering; Engineering exhibitions; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Ahlgren, D.J., Verner, I.M., Fire-fighting robot international competitions: Education through interdisciplinary design (2001) Proceedings of International Conference on Engineering Education, pp. 7B3-1; Ahlgren, D.J., Verner, I.M., Robot projects as education design experiments (2005) Proceedings of International Conference on Engineering Education, 2, pp. 524-529; Andersen, A., Implementation of engineering product design using international student teamwork - To comply with, future needs (2001) European Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (2), pp. 179-186; Denton, A.A., The role of technical education, training and the engineering profession in the wealth-creating process (1998) Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 212 (PART B), pp. 337-340; Fink, F.K., Integration of work based learning in engineering education (2001) 31st ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, , October; Fischbein, E., (1987) Intuition in Science and Mathematics, An Educational Approach, pp. 121-142. , Reidel Publishing Company; Frank, M., Lavy, I., Elata, D., Implementing the project-based learning approach in an academic engineering course (2003) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 13, pp. 273-288; Friesel, A., Guo, M., Husman, L., Vullum, N., Project in robotics at the copenhagen university college of engineering (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE, International Conference on Robotics & Automation, pp. 1375-1380. , New Orleans, LA, April; Friesel, A., Learning robotics by combining the theory with practical design and competition in undergraduate engineering education AutoSoft Journal, International Journal on Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing; Special Issue on Robotics Education; Green, A.M., Project-based learning: Moving students toward meaningful learning (1998) ERIC Database, , ED422466; Hedberg, T., The impact of the bologna declaration on European engineering education (2003) European Journal of Engineering Education, 28 (1), pp. 1-5; Heitmann, G., Challenges of engineering education and curriculum development in the context of the Bologna process (2005) European Journal of Engineering Education, 30 (4), pp. 447-458; Kracjik, J., Czerniak, C., Berger, C., (1999) Teaching Science: A Project-Based Approach, , McGraw-Hill College, New York; Larson, E.C., La Fasto, F., (1989) Team Work, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Michau, F., Gentil, S., Barrault, M., Expected benefits of web-based learning for engineering education: Examples in control engineering (2001) European Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (2), pp. 151-168; Siegwart, R.Y., Buchi, R., Buhler, P., Mechatronics Education at ETH Zurich based on 'hands on' experience (1998) 6th UK Mechatronics Forum International Conference, pp. 667-672; Tranter, I., Brown, F., A synergy of cultures - The place of multidisciplinary teams in final year undergraduate design projects (1994) Proceedings of the Second International Symposium in Engineering Education; http://campusnet.ihk.dk; How do you measure success?

This diversity of fields makes it hard for the students to integrate all these knowledge, which in turns results essential to tackle real and practical problems that involve different subjects. As a response to this need of integration, in University Rey Juan Carlos an educational project based on Problem Based Learning (PBL), called the Wireles4x4 Project, has been carried out. In this project, groups of students build a complete system that is able to autonomously drive a radio controlled car, involving different technologies such as wireless communications, positioning systems, power management or system integration. The objectives of this educational project are: (1) The development of an active learning methodology, by which the students acquire integrated knowledge and skills on a variety of subjects; (2) The acquisition of professional skills like teamwork capabilities, oral and written communication, and long term task scheduling; (3) The participation of the students in an interdisciplinary engineering project with time and budgetary constraints. The results show that the participating students improve not only their specific knowledge on the involved issues, but also their capability of integrating different subjects of the degree and the skills for autonomous learning.) © 2010 IEEE.","Integrating learning; Problem based learning; Professional capabilites training; Telecommunication engineering","Active Learning; Autonomous learning; Budgetary constraints; Complete system; Educational projects; Engineering degrees; Engineering project; Knowledge areas; Learning experiences; Learning problem; Long term; Oral and written communication; Positioning system; Power managements; Practical problems; Problem based learning; Professional skills; Radio propagation; Specific knowledge; System integration; Task-scheduling; Telecommunication engineering; Wireless communications; Energy management; Integration; Knowledge engineering; Professional aspects; Radio waves; Signal theory; Students; Telecommunication; Wireless telecommunication systems; Engineering education","Albanese, M.A., Mitchell, S., Problem-based learning: A review of literature on its outcomes and implementation issues (1993) Acad Med, 68, pp. 52-81; Felder, R.M., Silverman, L.K., Learning and teaching styles in engineering education (1998) Eng.

Role-play training may be an appropriate tool for universities to use as an efficient alternative to on-the-job training (OJT) for project management education. However, we have found that because of the way that role-play exercises using an on-line group work training system in the project management course have operated, students have not been able to share the required information adequately with other students. In order to investigate the effectiveness of using an agent in roleplay training, we have developed a role-play scenario so as to practice with agents. The results of analyzing the behavioral track record of each learner in a role-play exercise with agents are discussed. The results of a questionnaire survey taken among students who participated in a role-play exercise with agents indicate that the use of role-plays will enable them to learn human-related skills such as communication, leadership, and team building. © 2010 IEEE.","Agent; Project management education; Role-play training","Group work; On-the-job training; Project management education; Questionnaire surveys; Role play; Role-play training; Role-plays; Team building; Track record; Training Systems; Behavioral research; Project management; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Engineering education","http://www.mext.go.jp/a-menu/koutou/it/shiryo/06041212.html,inJapanese, 1st report of the Cultivation of Advanced ICT human Resources Promotion Committee of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, 11th April, 2006; Nakamura, T., An approach, to designing a project management course (2008) 4th ProMAC International Conference, pp. 937-944; Nakamura, T., Maruyama, H., Project management role-play training system based on scenario-driven architecture (2008) 4th ProMAC International Conference, pp. 929-936; Nakamura, T., Kitaura, Y., Noguchi, T., Maruyama, H., Practical project management education - Approach of five years (2009) The 16th Proceedings of Annual Spring Conference 2009 of the Society of Project Management, pp. 219-224. , Japan, 2009, 2308, in Japanese; Nakamura, T., Kitaura, Y., Maruyama, H., Takashima, A., Analysis of learners' behavior in role-play training for project management education (2009) The 9th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT 2009), pp. 144-146; Takaoka, R., Okamoto, T., An educational dialogue strategy in planrecognition and learning supporting system based on multi-agent (1996) IEICE Technical Report.

As a consequence, the aim of these practical classes is completely distorted. A solution to this problem is the well-known project based learning approach (PBL). In this paper, the influence of practical classes, each one organized as a small PBL activity, is analyzed in the field of a microcontroller-based system design course. When the results obtained in different years are compared in order to analyze an educational methodology, some variables of this analysis change (e.g.: the group of student, the difficulty of the exams, etc). Instead, in this paper the marks obtained by students that faced the practical classes correctly are compared with the marks of the students that considered them just as a requirement that needs to be fulfilled. In this way, the analysis is not distorted by the change of some variables. © 2010 IEEE.","Digital; Microcontroller; PBL; Practical","Digital microcontrollers; Digital system; Educational methodologies; Project-based learning approach; System design; Controllers; Curricula; Engineering education; Microcontrollers; Students","Magdalena, R., Serrano, A.J., Martin-Guerrero, J.D., Rosado, A., Martinez, M., A teaching laboratory in analog electronics: Changes to address the Bologna requirements (2008) Education, IEEE Transactions on, 51, pp. 456-460; Martins, M.J., Thiriet, J.M., Bonnaud, O., Hoffmann, M., Robert, M., Benlloch, J., Van Jer, G., A survey of the evolution of the Bologna Process in EIE in Europe (2008) EAEEIE Annual Conference, 2008 19th; Costa, L.R.J., Honkala, M., Lehtovuori, A., Applying the problembased learning approach to teach elementary circuit analysis (2007) Education, IEEE Transactions on, 50, pp. 41-48; Mantri, A., Dutt, S., Gupta, J.P., Chitkara, M., Design, and evaluation of a PB L-based course in analog electronics (2008) Education, IEEE Transactions on, 51, pp. 432-438; Rui Hong, C., Lu, D.D.C., Sathiakumar, S., Project-based lab teaching for power electronics and drives (2008) Education, IEEE Transactions on, 51, pp. 108-113; Huan, D., Inane, T., Low cost mobile robotics exper iment with camera and sonar sensors (2009) American Control Conference, 2009.

Online laboratories are interactive experiments which are available over the Internet and can be divided into two main groups, software simulations and laboratories made up of real hardware equipment. Technology-enhanced learning is becoming a new important trend in higher education worldwide. In particular, engineering education is becoming an exciting emerging field of research because it involves a multitude of disciplines which aim to resolve the pedagogical problems that arise with the advancement of technology.

Specifically, these subjects are sited at the Telecommunications Engineering studies lectured in the University of Valladolid. In a first step two first grade subjects have been established, while in a second and final step, coinciding with the new degrees beginning, it will be extended to five subjects placed in consecutive semesters. The global programming has been divided into several subprojects of growing complexity, developed into subjects sited in different and successive semesters of the degree, following a pathway leading to the development of a global project throughout four years. The whole learning process is ICTsupported, as tools for overcoming distance and scheduling barriers are offered. In particular, Moodle platform is used, which has been enhanced with self-evaluation and co-evaluation tools developed by the teaching group. Main innovation regarding to the classical approach consists of a computer programming subject focused on the student learning and based on the detailed specification of the activity the students have to perform in and out of the classroom in order to achieve the educational objectives of each of the subjects. The educational strategies used to accomplish these objectives are based on the cooperative learning, on the teamwork developing a programming project (Project Based Learning, PBL), and on the discovery learning. © 2010 IEEE.","Engineering subjects; European credit transfer system; Moodle platform; Project based learning","Adaptation process; Classical approach; Cooperative learning; Discovery learning; Educational objectives; Educational strategy; European credit transfer systems; Evaluation tool; Global projects; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning process; MOODLE platform; Programming projects; Project based learning; Self evaluation; Student learning; Telecommunication engineering; Computer programming; Computer software selection and evaluation; Curricula; Engineering; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Llera, B., Procesos, J., Estrategias y Técnicas de Aprendizaje (1993) Editorial Síntesis, , S.A.

With the PMMHE is possible to produce a comparative measurement system (benchmarking) of organizational, tactical, logistical and operational processes for formation, training and coaching programs in higher education institutions. The current PMMHE's release has impact on engineering programs and emerges as a strategy of the Colombian Government in its effort to articulate the university and industry, particularly the software industry and education of software engineering and their related areas at technical, technological and professional levels. The model is defined as knowledge management tool, which provides a scenario of variables and requirements classified by process categories and areas, practices, resources and products of processes, in which the institutions can to develop assessment practices to exchange resources, knowledge assets and best practices. This scenario is seeking to promote the establishment of a process improvement environment in higher education programs of engineering. It is very important to emphasize that the model's strategy is the transition from the subjective to the objective, for obtaining impact and spread and internalization knowledge, beyond the mission statement of institutions. This derivation from hypotheses to the thesis supported in facts, leads the formal use of statistical process control for knowledge management which includes the measurement systems analysis and collect measures about teaching - learning collective and individual processes under constantly balancing between the theory and the practice about the scientific and professional aspect. Also, this paper presents the lessons learned and the assessment for applying the model to 58 companies and 5 institutions of higher education related with the software industry in Colombia. © 2010 IEEE.","Knowledge management in higher education; Measure systems for higher education; Process maturity model in higher education","Assessment practices; Best practice; Colombia; Colombians; Comparative measurements; Educational program; Engineering program; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Knowledge assets; Knowledge management tool; Lessons learned; Management Model; Measurement systems analysis; Mission statement; Operational process; Process Improvement; Process management; Professional levels; Software industry; Software Quality; Teaching-learning; Computer software selection and evaluation; Industry; Knowledge management; Management; Measurements; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Software engineering; Statistical process control; Strategic planning; Engineering education","Processes for Engineering A System, , ANSI/EIA-632-1999; Standard CMMI® (2006) Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SACMPI.

However, lack of funding and increasing costs for equipment makes it harder and harder to supply a complete pool of experiments for large student classes. The EU funded ""Library of Labs"" project aims to counterbalance this development by creating a EU wide network of remotely controlled experiments and virtual laboratories. Remote experiments are here real experiments remotely controlled over a network, virtual laboratories simulation environments using the component metaphor of a real laboratories. In this paper, we introduce such a virtual laboratory developed at the University of Stuttgart; the aim here is to help students, here participating in the undergraduate physics course for engineers, understanding abstract phenomena by visualizing the underlying mathematics. We demonstrate this in a particular usecase, the wave equation and phenomena related to it, as they are discussed in undergraduate physics, and show how to implement this as a simulation in the virtual laboratory. In cooperation with the physics department a deployment plan for this experiment and related experiments has been created for the lecture ""Physics for Engineering"" which shall also be presented and discussed. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Controlled experiment; Deployment plans; Remote experiments; Simulation environment; Undergraduate engineering educations; Virtual laboratories; Computer simulation; Digital libraries; Engineering; Engineering education; Laboratories; Students; Teaching; Wave equations; Experiments","Wieman, C., Perkin, K., Transforming physics education (2005) Physics Today, 58, pp. 26-41; Schauer, F., Ožvoldová, M., Lustig, F., (2009) Integrated E-Learning New Strategy of Cognition of Real Word in Teaching Physics, , To be published in Innovations 2009 (USA), World Innovations in Engineering Education and Research iNEER Special Volume; eContentplus project Library of Labs, EU grant ECP-2008-EDU-428037, (2009); Schloegl, F., (1989) Probability and Heat, , Vieweg, Braunschweig; Jeschke, S., Richter, T.H., Scheel, H., Thomsen, C., On remote and virtual experiments in elearning (2007) J. of Software, 2 (6). , Academy Publisher; Jackson, J.D., (1998) Classical Electrodynamics, , Wiley, New York; Hrgovčić, H.J., Discrete Representations of the n-Dimensional Wave Equation (1992) J.

Analysis of the student population specifically within EE provides insights into a large segment of the undergraduate engineering population. Using a dataset from universities in the United States of America that includes over 70,000 students who majored in engineering, this work considers the subset of that population matriculating in EE. The rates of EE matriculation and six-year graduation vary by race and gender. The relevant findings are that males out number females at all levels of undergraduate EE. EE is the most popular choice for Asian and Black males at matriculation and the second choice (after ME) for Hispanic and White males. EE is much more popular for Asian and Black females than Hispanic and White females at matriculation and graduation. In fact, more Black females graduate in EE than in any other engineering discipline. The six-year graduation rate of EE matriculants is higher than that of students of other engineering disciplines. These findings suggest the importance disaggregating by engineering subdiscipline and examining how such information is useful in improving recruitment and retention overall. © 2010 IEEE.","Electrical Engineering; Gender; Race; Retention","Data sets; Engineering disciplines; Graduation rates; Hispanics; Quantitative analysis; Student populations; Undergraduate engineering; United States of America; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Students; Engineering education","(2006) Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future, , http://www.nap.ed.u./catalog/11463.html, National Academy of Engineering; (2008) Changing the Conversation: Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineering, , National Academy of Engineering; Terman, F.E., A brief history of electrical engineering education (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE, 86 (8), pp. 1792-1800. , August; (2008) Engineering Data Management System, , http://www.asee.org/datamining/reports/, American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) [accessed 2009 October 29]; Anderson, L.S., Gilbride, K.A., Pre-university outreach: Encouraging students to consider engineering careers (2003) Global.

The social and economic conditions of the country where the student has studied have an impact on his level of knowledge though the attained degree is similar in all countries. It is not enough to use scores as a base for decisions. Some tests for software courses, English language etc. exists. Now the challenge is to design and implement a common test to analyze the knowledge of the student/ test taker and certify him in performing laboratory work and operating electronic instruments. A solution to overcome the problem of recruiting companies in this global market as well as the universities to select the meritorious from worldwide would be by implementing a Common Electronics Lab Operation Test. A test with the operation of the equipment in electronics laboratory has importance as test takers are tested in their knowledge with practical equipment using simulated and remote labs which are identical to the operation of real.

This paper presents an approach where closer integration between learning and work is achieved by integrating multimedia services into manufacturing processes. The goal of E-Learning services integration in manufacturing is, through the development of new multimedia solutions, to accelerate and enhance the ability of manufacturing industry to capitalise on the emergence of a powerful global information infrastructure. In this paper we suggest to combine the areas of media streaming services and manufacturing processes, by providing electronic learning offerings as collections of media streaming services. The key components of our approach are 1) an xml based streaming service specification language, 2) automated configuration of distributed E-Learning streaming applications, 3) web services for searching, registration, and creation of E-Learning streaming services. © 2010 IEEE.","Just-in-time learning; Manufacturing processes; Media streaming services; Web services","Automated configuration; Electronic learning; Global Information Infrastructure; Just-in-time learning; Key component; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing process; Media streaming services; Multimedia streaming services; Separate learning; Streaming applications; Streaming service; Acoustic streaming; E-learning; Engineering education; Industrial engineering; Integration; Manufacture; Multimedia services; Production engineering; Specification languages; Web services; Media streaming","Khasawneh, B., El-Seoud, S.A., Framework for on-demand elearning resources allocation and distribution (2006) OERAD International Journal of Computing & Information Sciences, 4 (2); Borissova, D., Mustakerov, I., A framework of multimedia Elearning design for engineering training (2009) LNCS, 5686, pp. 88-97. , ICWL 2009, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg 2009; Hillenbrand, M., Götze, J., Müller, P., Voice over IP - Considerations for a next generation architecture (2005) EUROMICRO-SEAA, pp. 386-395. , IEEE Computer Society; Uyar, A., Wu, W., Bulut, H., Fox, G., Service-oriented architecture for a scalable videoconferencing system (2005) Proc. of IEEE Int.

The project has four main objectives: (1) to stimulate a change of attitude among students towards studying, forcing them to change their passive listener role to a more active role; (2) to increase students' motivation by adjusting the visual features and the interface of the environment to the peculiarities in the way members of the net generation interact with contents and process them; (3) to help to develop communication skills, teamwork abilities and soft skills in our students, while at the same time they acquire the knowledge and technical abilities included in the subject curriculum; (4) to integrate the platform into an e-learning management system application as a way of centralizing the data management, while at the same time offering the chance to combine it with the use of other instructional strategies that can be applied to wider contexts. This paper introduces the reference framework under which the NUCLEO system has been developed, along with the specific model designed to fulfil the objectives mentioned above. © 2010 IEEE.","Computer supportted collaborative learning; Problem based learning; Virtual laming environments","Collaborative learning; Communication skills; Data management; E-learning management systems; Instructional strategy; Multi-user virtual environment; Problem based learning; Problem-based; Soft skills; Visual feature; Curricula; Education computing; Interoperability; Motivation; Students; Virtual reality; Engineering education","Alfonseca, E., Carro, R.M., Martin, E., Ortigosa, A., Paredes, P., The impact of learning styles on student grouping for collaborative learning: A case study (2006) User Modelling and User-Adapted Interaction, 16 (3-4), pp. 377-401. , DOI 10.1007/s11257-006-9012-7, Special Issue on User Modeling to Support Groups, Communities and Collaboration (Guest Editors: H.

However, in the literature, there is no consensus on the equivalence of paper-and-pencil and computer-based test environments. Accordingly, more evidences are needed especially for the engineering education. In this study, students' performance on different test modes was evaluated on 209 first year engineering students of a chemistry course. The results of this study showed that, there is no significant performance difference between paper-and-pencil and computer based tests. By comparing results with the previous studies, this study concludes that, personal characteristics of test takers, the features of computer-based testing systems and the test content are all possible confounding factors when comparing test modes and need to be considered by the implementers. The results of this study show that, once these factors are controlled, students' performance on computer-based tests and paper-and-pencil tests in chemistry courses for the engineering students will not vary. This finding is encouraging the educators to get benefits of computer-based tests without any affect on students' performance © 2010 IEEE.","Computer based exams; Engineering education; Paper-and-pencil based exams; Test-Mode effect","Computer based exams; Computer-based testing; Computer-based tests; First-year engineering; Personal characteristics; Computer control systems; Computer testing; Paper; Students; Teaching; Testing; Engineering education; Automatic Control; Computers; Education; Engineers; Paper; Performance; Testing","Brown, G., Race, P., Bull, J., (1999) Computer-assisted Assessment in Higher Education, , Kogan Page: London; Ashcroft, K., Palacio, D., (1996) Researching into Assessment and Evaluation in Colleges and Universities, , London, UK: Kogan Page; Bugbee Jr., A.C., The equivalence of paper-and-pencil and computer-based testing (1996) Journal of Research on Computing in Education, 28 (3), pp. 282-299; Sawaki, Y., Comparability of conventional and computerized tests of reading in a second language (2001) Language Learning & Technology, 5 (2), pp. 38-59; Ricketts, C., Wilks, S.J., Improving student performance through computer-based assessment: Insights from recent research (2002) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 27 (5), p. 2002; Schaeffer, G.A., Reese, C.M., Steffen, M., McKinley, R.L., Mills, C.N., (1993) Field Test of Computer-based GRE General Test ETS Research Report, , #93-07 (ERIC #ED385588); Finegan, J.E., Allen, N.J., Computerised, and written questionnaires: Are they equivalent?

Multiple enhancements of the learning experience are usually attributed to educational games, although the most cited is their potential to improve students' motivation. In spite of these expected advantages, how to introduce video games in the learning process is an issue that is not completely clear yet, which reduces the potential impact of educational video games. Our goal at the <eUCM> research group is to identify the barriers that are limiting the integration of games in the learning process and propose approaches to tackle them. The result of this work is the <eAdventure> platform, an educational game authoring tool that aims to make of video games just another educational tool at the disposal of the instructors. In this paper we describe how <eAdventure> contributes to the integration of games in the learning process through three main focuses: reduction of the high development costs of educational games, involvement of instructors in the development process to enhance the educational value, and the production of the games using a whitebox model. In addition we describe the current research that we are conducting using the platform as a test-bed. © 2010 IEEE.","<E-Adventure>; Authoring tool; Educational games; LAMS","Academic community; Authoring tool; Development costs; Development process; Educational game; Educational tools; Educational videos; Learning experiences; Learning process; Potential impacts; Research groups; Video game; White-box models; Education computing; Engineering education","Prensky, M., Digital natives, digital immigrants (2001) On the Horizon.

The social network analysis has been used in several initiatives showing that it is an approach that can contribute in building the semantic web. Within the project Technologies Applied to Electronics Teaching (TAEE) there are biannual conferences (it has been organized since 1996) and have accumulated a significant amount of data resulting from the conferences held. All of this information constitutes a data source that should be exploited and that can provide meaningful information. In this document we describe, how to social network analysis has been used on data sources generated by user communities, in order to obtain some semantic artifacts, like ontologies. Also describes how to was applied the social network analysis and its metrics on the information generated in the TAEE congresses to answer a set of questions (What are the relationships and the level of cohesion of the different organizations (at the level of Spain and across continents) involved in TAEE? How have evolutioned the thematics covered in the conference?, What are the new ontological additions in technology over the years?, and How have evolutioned the thematics in the research and studies related to teaching electronics?) formulated by the organizers of the congresses and that through other approaches would have been a large task and complicated. The answers to the questions can provide us important information about the behavior and characteristics of the elements present in TAEE conferences, furthermore being an element for making decisions on future initiatives with the same style of TAEE. © 2010 IEEE.","Meta-analysis; Metrics; RedOBER; Results; SNA; TAEE","Data source; In-buildings; Making decision; Meta-analysis; Social Network Analysis; User communities; Decision making; Engineering education; Ontology; Semantic Web; Semantics; Electric network analysis","Aleman-Meza, B., Nagarajan, M., Ding, L., Sheth, A., Arpinar, I.B., Joshi, A., Finin, T., Scalable semántica analytics on social networks for addressing the problem, of conflict of interest detection (2008) ACM Trans.

Our experience is framed within the First Plan in Teaching of the University of Seville. All involved subjects belong to the electronic technology area and from three Computer Science degrees. We propose to use, in a combined way, some learning techniques: cooperative learning as complement to traditional learning, role-playing technique and jigsaw technique. We have considered a base methodology but in each subject a variant of it has been accomplished. We have used several evaluation techniques, such as reciprocal evaluation, electronic portfolio and check lists. Applying our methodology helps us to detect learning problems before the term ends. Also, in tune with the framework of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), our methology gives a boost to develop transversal competences as important as work (or study) management, empathy and understanding of other members in a workgroup, conflict resolution, capacity to make decisions as well as coordinate and communicate with other members in a workgroup and also with the professor. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; Cooperative learning; Electronic portfolio; Evaluation techniques; Innovative education; Reciprocal evaluation; Role-playing","Check-lists; Conflict Resolution; Cooperative learning; Electronic portfolios; Electronic technologies; European Higher Education Area; Innovative education; Innovative learning; Learning problem; Learning techniques; Seville; Teaching methodologies; Traditional learning; University degree; Workgroups; Computer science; Innovation; Learning algorithms; Engineering education","Aronson, E., The jigsaw classroom (1978) Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications; Beets, S.D., Differences in student learning techniques: Cooperative learning, quizzes, and homework (2003) Journal of the Academy of Bussiness Education, pp. 1-11; Cuseo, J.B., (1996) Cooperative Learning: A Pedagogy for Addressing Contemporary Challenges & Critical Issues in Higher Education, , Marymont College, New Forum Press; (2009), http://www.eees.es, Disponible en: / Consulta: 12 de mayo; Fowler, L., Active learning: An empirical study of the use of simulation games in the introductory financial accounting class (2006) Academy of Educational Leadership Journal, 10 (3), pp. 93-103. , Consultado el 12 de mayo de 2009, desde AB1/INFORM Global database, (Document ID: 1291466841); Gil, C., Gil, M.D., (2009) Taller de Formación - Metodologías Activas: Estrategias de Aprendizaje Cooperativo, , Instituto de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla; Gómez, I.M., Necesidades del profesorado de la Universidad de Sevilla respecto a las metodologías de enseñanza de cara a la adaptación al EEES (2007) Proyecto de la Convocatoria de Ayuda A la Docencia Para la Innovación (Curso 2006/2007), , Instituto de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad de Sevilla; Gómez, I.M., Aplicación de técnicas de evaluación continua en grupos numerosos de alumnos (2006) Proyecto de la Convocatoria de Ayuda A la Docencia Para la Innovación (Curso 2006/2007), , Instituto de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad de Sevilla; Gómez, I.M., Aplicaciones del sistema de créditos europeo a la actividad de las tutorías (USE N071) (2005) Proyecto Andaluz de Formación Del Profesorado Universitario (Convocatoria 2004), , Unidad para la Calidad de las Universidades Andaluzas (UCUA); Gómez, L.M., Mejora de la enseñanza basada en la autoevaluación docente (55-T-USE 1.4) (2004) Proyecto Andaluz de Formación Del Profesorado Universitario (Convocatoria 2003), , Unidad para la Calidad de las Universidades Andaluzas (UCUA); Peña, O., On certain integrals of Lipschitz-Hankel type involving products of Bessel functions (2006) Phil.

The topics toughed in this course can be grouped into two. The first group includes simple concepts like binary numbering system, hard disk, memory, and I/O devices. In the second group, an introduction to the courses that they will take in the next semesters of the program which includes programming, networking, software engineering, artificial intelligence and database systems. The main objective of this course is to give an introduction about the general concepts of the field to the first year Computer Engineering students and prepare them to understand the connections between them for their future studies. However, students and instructors face with many problems in this course. First, because of the diversity of the concepts given in the course, it is very difficult for the students to see the big picture of the Computer Engineering domain. Similarly, it is difficult for the instructors to prepare the course content in an integrated manner at the students' level. Additionally, the perception of the theory and practice behind the hardware and software topics and their connections is not an easy task for the beginners. Moreover, the topics are mostly abstract topics, which do not allow application of any laboratory sessions. Students usually find this course difficult to understand, which decreases their motivation about the department and success of the course. This study is established to propose a concept map approach to better visualize and discover all the connections between the concepts of Computer Engineering field which can be used in the curriculum of the programs and introductory courses of the field addressing the above problems. The proposed concept map helps to visualize the general picture of the field. © 2010 IEEE.","Computer engineering; Concept maps; Curriculum development","Basic concepts; Computer engineering; Computer engineering course; Concept maps; Course contents; Curriculum development; First year; Hard disks; Hardware and software; I/O Device; Introductory course; Laboratory sessions; Second group; Theory and practice; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Curricula; Database systems; Engineering; Engineering education; Numbering systems; Students; Teaching","Nisan, N., Schocken, S., (2005) The Elements of Computing Systems, Building A Modern Computer from First Principles, , MIT Press; Roberts, E., The dream of a common language: The search for simplicity and stability in computer science education (2004) SIGCSE, 4. , March Virginia, USA; Turner, E.H., Turner, R.M., Teaching entering students to think like computer scientists (2005) SIGCSEVS, , February, Mossouri, USA; Goldman, K.J., A concepts-first introduction to computer sceince SIGCSE'04, , Vrginia,USA; Gupta, K.C., Ramadoss, R., Zhang, H., Concept mapping and concept modules for web-based and CD-ROM-based RF and microwave education (2003) IEEE Trans.

All educational activities and resources need to be related to the intended learning outcomes of a learning module or course, in order to assist the learners in successfully achieving the intended learning outcomes at the end of the learning experience. Outcome based assessment means that the assessment process must be aligned with the learning outcomes. This means that it should support the learners in their progress (formative assessment) and validate the achievement of the intended learning outcomes at the end of the process (summative assessment). It also means that the assessment process should be adapted depending on the kind of outcomes that it is aimed to appraise. This paper presents an insight into the current state of outcome based learning within Europe and proposes a unified conceptual model for outcome based assessment, shaping a theoretical framework for the integration of learning outcomes, assessment and units of learning as key concepts. An application scenario is Anally described to illustrate the application of the model. © 2010 IEEE.","Learning assessment; Learning outcomes; Unit of learning","Application scenario; Assessment process; Conceptual model; Educational activities; Focal points; Formative assessment; Learning assessment; Learning experiences; Learning modules; Learning outcome; Learning process; Outcome-based assessment; Outcome-based education; Theoretical framework; Learning systems; Engineering education","(2000) The EQF for Lifelong Learning, Office for the Publication of the EC, , EQF.

Complex engineering projects are usually carried out by the assimilation of different work teams, which could even be located geographically distant. Collaborative Web environments are proven to be ideal knowledge repositories, as it has seen in Academia and in Industry. The work here presented reproduces the organization of actual engineering projects, and brings it into the classroom. This new way of developing Project Work documentation and discussion has helped students become self-directed learners who internalize specific topics from different subjects, programmes and courses with their own interests, and has been considered as an easy alternative to promote active learning, not only in this area but in other courses. Project were launched in the engineering disciplines, each offering possibilities for the application of specific skills in the following courses: TEC -Manufacturing Technology-, CAD Computer Aided Design-, SIM -Simulation in Mechanical Engineering-, and FAB -Fabrication / Manufacturing. TEC and SIM are applied in the Mechanical Engineering programme at ETSII, while FAB is part of the Industrial Engineering programme; finally CAD is voluntarily employed by students in different semesters and programmes. The new approach is oriented towards inducing collaboration within multidisciplinary teams. This paper describes the experience of collaboration among students and teachers in order to develop multidisciplinary projects, and to reproduce as closely as possible, the team's integration into a company environment. A new methodology based on student interaction and content development in a Wiki environment has been developed. The collaborative server has allowed creating an ""out-of-the- classroom"" active discussion forum for students of different teams /topics, and to compile an important ""project work"" portfolio. This experience has been very satisfactory for students and teachers, who have participated with enthusiasm due to the exit of the welldistributed work and the easiness of use of the selected platform (Wiki). The quality of the developed projects has been dramatically improved due to the integration of the results provided by the different teams. © 2010 IEEE.","Active learning; Collaborative work; Multidisciplinary approach; Project based learning; Teaching mechanical engineering; Wiki environment","Active Learning; Collaborative servers; Collaborative Work; Complex engineering; Content development; Developing projects; Discussion forum; Engineering disciplines; Engineering project; In-depth knowledge; Knowledge repository; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing technologies; Mechanical design; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multi-disciplinary teams; Multidisciplinary engineering; Multidisciplinary projects; New approaches; New product; Project based learning; Project work; Student interactions; Technical universities; Web environment; Work team; Computer aided design; Computer simulation; Curricula; Engineering; Industrial applications; Industrial engineering; Industry; Integration; Knowledge engineering; Mechanical engineering; School buildings; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Realff, M., Ludovice, P., Guzdial, M., Morley, T., Sukel, K., Computer supported collaborative learning for curriculum integration (2000) Computers and Chemical Engineering, 24 (2-7), pp. 1473-1479. , DOI 10.1016/S0098-1354(00)00538-X, PII S009813540000538X; Wang, H.-C., An empirical exploration of using wiki in an english as a second language course (2005) Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 155-157. , 2005.

However, the degree of difficulty increases dramatically with an increasing number of students and courses for which the scheduling shall be carried out. From the mathematical point of view this is a ""hard"" problem, since the runtime on a computer cannot be estimated by a simple law (i.e. by a polynomial law) by the number of parameters. These kinds of problems are called ""NP hard"". There are three important versions of the timetabling problem at universities, known as the university timetabling problem, i.e. curriculum-based course timetabling, post-enrollment timetabling and examination timetabling. All specified problems are important for room management at universities, for the realization of courses that can be studied according to curricula, and for the satisfaction of students and teachers. These problems are related to the optimization of room management and personnel costs (e.g. by a uniform distribution of students). Thus, the solution to these problems is related to the optimization of ""real"" costs, a more and more important economic factor at (German) universities. Introduction of the two-tiered Bachelor and Master courses has raised awareness for these problems at German universities: due to the multitude of new courses the timetables which have been established and stood the test of time cannot be used any longer. Moreover classes tend to be more structured and have strong similarities to classical school situations; attendance is compulsory and dependencies between modules determine the feasibility of the curricula. This feasibility is also evaluated while accrediting new study courses. Since 2003, we have been using using an algorithm that has been realized by members of our team for the solution of the post-enrollment-based course timetabling problem at the Technische Universität Berlin.. For classes with more than 2000 enrolled students, organization by itself is a challenge; problems may include splitting of those classes into several separate lectures, arranging the associated tutorials into small groups of students, allocating adequate rooms, and scheduling examinations. Moreover, homework and exams need to be administered, whereby, depending on the field of study, very different rules are to be obeyed. This especially pertains to the Department of Mathematics because it offers most of the compulsory classes in mathematics for all fields of study held at Technische Universität Berlin. These are the biggest classes at the university and are to be attended by the majority of students. Thus, the Moses (Mobile Services for Students)Account has been being developed and used since 2004. This webbased software allows students to enroll in tutorials with a list of preferences for given dates. A special algorithm, providing a globally optimized (with respect to the students' wishes and resources available) solution, processes all registrations. © 2010 IEEE.","Academic administration; Integer programming; NP-completeness; University timetabling","Economic factors; Examination timetabling; Master course; Mobile service; New study; Np-completeness; NP-hard; Optimal distributions; Personnel costs; Runtimes; Small groups; Special algorithms; Student numbers; Timetabling; Timetabling problem; Uniform distribution; University timetabling; University timetabling problems; Web-based softwares; Computational complexity; Curricula; Dynamic programming; Engineering education; Integer programming; Optimization; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Students","The bologna declaration on the European space for higher education: An explanation (2010) Confederation of EU Rectors' Conferences, , http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/educ/bologna/bologna.pdf, document prepared by the and the Association of European Universites (CRE), available at last accessed 21-January-; Burke, E., Jackson, K., Kingston, J.H., Weare, R., Automated university timetabling: The state of the art (1997) Comput.

In particular, the flexibility of Tablet PCs and digital ink has the potential to achieve a wide range of educational goals and promote a more dynamic classroom environment. However, as the possibilities of these educational technologies grow, it seems necessary to consider their role by conceptualizing the knowledge they provide. In this work we propose a teaching approach based on the use of conceptual maps to generate instructor guidelines for Tablet PC-based courses. Our approach combines the instructional domain with the technological one in order to offer practical guidelines to design and develop both lecture materials and active learning experiences, providing a systematic and flexible way to guide the teaching process in a Tablet PC-based learning scenarios. We present a case study on how to implement the approach in a first-year Computer Engineering course reporting the introduction of the Tablet PC in this educational setting. © 2010 IEEE.","Conceptual maps; Digital ink; Instructional design; Tablet pc","Active Learning; Classroom environment; Computer engineering course; Conceptual maps; Digital inks; Educational goals; Educational settings; Educational technology; First-year; Instructional designs; Learning scenarios; Lecture materials; Positive changes; Practical guidelines; Tablet PCs; Teaching approaches; Teaching process; Design; Engineering education; Ink; Personal computers; School buildings; Teaching","Stuart, J., Rutherford, R.J., Medical student concentration during lectures (1978) Lancet, 2 (8088), pp. 514-516; Tront, J.G., Facilitating Pedagogical Practices through a Large-Scale Tablet PC Deployment (2007) Computer, 40 (9), pp. 62-68; Bransford, J.D., Brown, A.L., Cocking, R.R., (1999) How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School, , National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., USA; Novak, J.D., (1998) Learning, Creating, and Using Knowledge: Concept Maps As Facilitative Tools in Schools and Corporations, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ; Frolik, J., Zurn, J.B., Evaluation of tablet PCs for engineering content development and instruction (2004) ASEE International Conference and Exposition, , Salt Lake City, UT; Toto, R., Wharton, M., Cimbala, J., Wise, J., One Step Beyond: Lecturing with a Tablet PC in (2006) ASEE International Conference and Exposition, , Chicago; Brophy, S., Walker, G., Case Study of the Pedagogical Impact of Tablet PCs as a Presentation Medium in large-scale Engineering Classrooms (2005) ASEE International Conference and Exposition, , Portland; Microsoft website on use of Tablet PC at a middle school Tablet PCs Go to School, , http://www.mi.crosoft.com/Education/OcoeeM.iddle.mspx; Classroom Presenter Website, , http://www.cs.washmgton.edu/educauon/dl/presenter/; DyKnow Homepage., , http://dyknow.com/products/vision; Tront, J.G., Prey, J., Classroom Presentations using Tablet PC and WriteOn (2006) ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, , San Diego, CA; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View, , Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York; Richardson, R., Fox, E.A., Woods, J., Evaluating concept maps as a cross-language knowledge discovery tool for NDLTD (2008) Proceedings of Tenth International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations, , Uppsala University Library, Sweden; Carvalho, M.R., Hewett, R., Cañas, A.J., Enhancing web searches from concept map-based knowledge models (2001) Proceedings of SCI 2001: Fifth Multiconference on Systems, Cybernetics and Informatics.

This system offers an easily-accessible environment with various tools for managing learners and courses, and for producing rich contents. However, beside the rich contents, certain fields of study require that courses be accompanied with/followed by laboratory activities which help learners deepen their understanding of the new concepts and develop skills on applying them in close-to-real-world context. More emphasize has been put on these activities when laboratory-based courses appeared and proved to be functioning well in delivering the information. Several stand-alone laboratories have been constructed to support delivery of such activities on-line, but laboratory-tools are not available within the LMS. To address this point, our research presents an approach towards integrating one stand-alone laboratory (NVLab) into Sakai LMS to enable the use of laboratory activities within the course context. The study suggests integrating parts of the original system into Sakai, and then using the LMS's ""linktool"" to connect to the other part. So far, an initial version of the new tool has been accomplished and we are in the testing phase of the new tool on a demo version of Sakai before putting it into service within the campus-wide system. © 2010 IEEE.","K3.1.d distance learning; K3.2 computer and information science education; Learning management systems; Web-based laboratories","Distance learning; Information science education; K3.1.d distance learning; Learning management system; Web based laboratories; E-learning; Engineering education; Information science; Laboratories; Management; Scheduling; Learning systems","Sarkar, N.I., Teaching computer networking fundamentals using practical laboratory exercises (2006) IEEE Trans.

The research experiments are being conducted with chemistry graduating students at the Universidade Federal de Pelotas in Rio Grande do Sul, during one semester, but it is planned to extend the studies to the engineering courses. The tests to check the subsumers are based on some theoretical questions related to the mathematical concepts already mentioned. Preliminary results of the testing show arithmetic and algebraic disabilities in a percentage of the group, as only 60% of the students answered the tests correctly. Based on the answers analysis contextualized activities are proposed to enrich the mathematics application in chemistry with the objective of favoring the development of the subsumers needed to the comprehension of the PC phenomena studied. © 2010 IEEE.","Interdisciplinarity; Mathematics; Meaningful learning; Physical chemistry","Contextualized activity; Engineering course; Gas law; Interdisciplinarity; Learning process; Mathematical concepts; Mathematical relation; Rio Grande do Sul; Teaching approaches; Mathematical techniques; Paper and pulp mills; Physical chemistry; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Zimmer, A., Aguiar, B.C.X.C., Leguenza, E.L., Aguiar, G.F., Desenvolvimento de Laboratório Virtual de Cálculo Diferencial e Integral (2007) XXXV Congresso Brasileiro de Educação em Engenharia, , Curitiba.

This study was motivated by the comparison of the results obtained after applying Cooperative Learning (CL) and Project Based Learning (PBL) to a subject of Computer Engineering. The fundamental hypothesis tested was whether the academic success achieved by the students of the first years was higher when CL was applied than in those cases to which PBL was applied. A practical case, by means of which the effectiveness of CL and PBL are compared, is presented in this work. This study has been carried out at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where these mechanisms have been applied to the Operating Systems I subject from the Technical Engineering in Computer Systems degree (OSIS) and to the same subject from the Technical Engineering in Computer Management degree (OSIM). Both subjects have the same syllabus, are taught in the same year and semester and share also formative objectives. From this study we can conclude that students' academic performance (regarding the grades given) is greater with PBL than with CL. To be more specific, the difference is between 0.5 and 1 point for the individual tests. For the group tests, this difference is between 2.5 and 3 points. Therefore, this study refutes the fundamental hypothesis formulated at the beginning. Some of the possible interpretations of these results are referred to in this study. © 2010 IEEE.","Collaborative work; Education; Engineering education","Academic performance; Active Learning; Bologna declaration; Collaborative work; Computer engineering; Cooperative learning; European Higher Education Area; First year; Management degree; Operating systems; Project based learning; Technical engineering; Computer operating systems; Engineering; Students; Engineering education","(2009) Bologna+10 Ministerial Conference, , http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/, Bologna Process , Apr.

Students cannot ask questions and get responses immediately. It is similar to one way communication for learning. However, learning is most effective when it actively constructs knowledge during group social interaction and collaboration. Therefore, this paper proposes to inspire creativity in e-learning called the virtual interactive classroom by using RTMP (RealTime Messaging Protocol) which is a sophisticated TCP-based real-time networking protocol which supports the efficient exchange of messages, synchronized data, audio, and video. Teachers and students can publish streaming audio, video and other data messages to present streaming media with interaction or navigation. Using this virtual classroom on the internet, students can immediately interact with teachers as though they were studying in a real classroom. In addition to the virtual interactive classroom, this article also proposes using web-based collaborative work as an add-on feature to the learning system. Both teacher and student can use web-based collaborative work for sharing resources and exchanging ideas after the class. The integration of the two concepts of the virtual interactive classroom and web-based collaborative work in order to enhance teaching and learning performance has been created. © 2010 IEEE.","Learning system; Virtual interactive classroom; Webbased collaborative work; Wikis","Collaborative Work; Data messages; Face-to-face communications; Interactive classroom; Messaging protocols; Networking protocols; Real time; Social interactions; Streaming media; Synchronized data; Teaching and learning; Virtual Classroom; Webbased collaborative work; Audio streaming; E-learning; Internet protocols; Learning systems; Media streaming; Network protocols; School buildings; Students; Teaching; Transmission control protocol; Websites; Engineering education","Incorporated, A.S., LiveDocs (online documentation) (2007) Macromedia Flash Media Server Documentation, , Adobe System Incorporated; Macromedia breeze (2007) Adobe System Incorporated, , http://www.adobe.eom/products/breeze/.index.htm; Augar, N., Raitman, R., Teaching, learning online with wikis (2004) Beyond the Comfort Zone: Proceedings of the 21st ASCILITE Conference, pp. 95-104; Bruns, A., Humphreys, S., Wikis in teaching and assessment: The M/cyclopedia project (2005) Proceedings of the ACM WikiSym 05: Internation Symposium on Wikis, , San Diago, USA; (2007) CollabWorx Virtual.

Despite the comparatively high education levels among Latvian employees, there is still a lack of knowledge and practical skills crucial for competitiveness in a market based economy. In order to ensure relevance of the qualifications and adaptability in the fast changing environment, active learning and teaching have a special importance. Recent developments in information technology call for a serious reconsideration of the actual teaching methods and provide opportunities for developing a new educational methodology. This paper focuses on experiences of application of information technologies within the course of Logistics Information Technology for developing students' practical skills and abilities. Experience shows, that social emotional skills and abilities of nowadays students have better response on interactive collaboration, especially on active methods of teaching. Therefore, the necessity for an active teaching and learning e-environment is highlighted, and its possible realisation with application of Web 2.0 technologies is discussed within the course of Logistics Information Technology. © 2010 IEEE.","Active teaching and learning; Information technology; Logistics information technology; Web 2.0","Active Learning; Active method; Active teaching and learning; Changing environment; E-environment; Educational methodologies; Logistics information; Market-based economy; Practical skill; School graduates; Teaching and learning; Teaching experience; Teaching methods; Web 2.0; Competition; Engineering education; Information technology; Students; World Wide Web; Teaching","Merkuryev, Y., Tolujev, J., Blumel, E., A modelling and simulation methodology for managing the Riga Harbour Container Terminal (1998) Simulation, 71 (2), pp. 84-95; Ginters, E., Bruzzone, A., Gutmaniset Al, A., LOGIS project - Network for knowledge consolidation and training in logistics information Systems (2002) TransBaltica 2002: Conference Materials.

However, how students should interact with each other is relatively ignored. It is a good idea that students learn within a supportive community in order to feel safe enough to take risks. Cooperative Learning (CL) is a successful teaching strategy in which small teams, composed by students with different skills, use a variety of learning activities to improve their understanding of a subject [1]. Each member of a team is responsible not only for learning what is taught but also for helping his or her teammates learn, thus creating an atmosphere of achievement.

It is by experiment that most scientists learn most about their discipline and in this paper the following ideas can be explored in simulations that in most cases use access to a database so that the exercises are personalised. The simulations are listed below. Simple Entity-Relationship diagrams: Where simple Entity-Relationship diagrams can be composed from a set of components and their validity checked. Entity-Relationships and tables that describe the entities: Where the student has to decide from tables of two entities the degree of participation and the participation conditions. With prompting the correct solution can be found and as many attempts as necessary are possible. Structured Query Language (SQL): Given a database various SQL queries can input and the way that the queries are dealt with are shown in detail not just the final result. Functional dependency: Given a table from a database this can used to find out whether there is any functional dependency between any of the columns and also to show what the primary key/s might be. Normalisation: A topic that confuses may students. This allows table to be split into a number of sub-tables and the result can be tested as to whether the selected table can be joined together to form the original table. Each of these ideas has a simulation and these will be discussed in terms of how to run the simulation and explaining what the simulation is trying to teach. There are some third party software requirements and these will be explained together with the solution that is used for the demonstrations. © 2010 IEEE.","Entity Relationship diagrams; Functional dependency; Multiplicity; Normalisation; Participation conditions; Structured Query Language; Tables","Correct solution; Data base theory; Entity relationship diagrams; Functional dependency; Normalisation; SQL query; Structured Query Language; Structured query languages; Teaching tools; Third party software; Engineering education; Graphic methods; Linguistics; Students; Query languages","Chen, P.-S., The entity-relationship model toward a unified view of data (1976) ACM Trans.

The use of such play-based methodologies for engineering education can promote several practical and communication skills of great value for students' future professional development. At the same time it greatly helps to motivate students and make them more aware of their own capabilities and the learning process. This paper details the application of a play-based methodology for improving students' results and motivation in the subject ""Development of Plastic Products"". The active learning strategy consists in assigning student groups different toy development tasks, so that they can apply the design concepts learned and present their results in public. It is thereby hoped to promote a set of abilities that are ever increasingly valued in the industrial and business world, such as teamwork, creativity and communications skills. Results have been compared with experiences from previous years, linked to the development of conventional products. The results show that carrying out a monographic experience on ""Toy - Design"" has promoted students' satisfaction, motivation and results. Some ideas for future improvements, mainly based on students' opinions, are also discussed. © 2010 IEEE.","Active learning; Cad-cam-cae tools; Learning through play; Motivating students; Rapid prototyping technologies","Active learning; Cad-cam-cae tools; Communication skills; Conventional products; Design concept; Design experience; Development tasks; Educational gaming; Effective tool; Higher education; Learning process; Learning through play; Previous year; Professional development; Rapid prototyping technology; Student groups; Students' satisfaction; Teaching-learning activities; Cams; Computer aided design; Concurrent engineering; Engineering education; Job analysis; Motivation; Plastic products; Rapid prototyping; Strategic planning; Teaching; Students","(1999) Bologna Declaration of the European Ministers of Education; Shuman, L., The ABET ""Professional Skills"" can they be taught? can they be assessed?

They are used as support tools for education, especially for higher education, and they promote equality and social justice by providing access to, applying, and generating knowledge. Until now OER's have been developed from the pedagogic perspective, without taking advantage of the recent developments in communication technologies. Integration of social tools improves the active participation of both the developers and users of the OER's. This promotes the rapid creation of content that is easily accessible via search engines linked to educational platforms and social networks. It also allows tagging, which gives users the ability to add descriptive metadata. Authorship is recognized through the use of intellectual property licenses that promote open use of the material so that it can be used and edited. And above all collaborative learning is promoted. In this article a new cycle of OER production is proposed that includes activities to incorporate social networks and semantic technologies. The phases of the production cycle are developed using the ADDIE instructional model. The purpose of each phase and the social and semantic components to be included are identified. And finally, application guidelines are presented that detail the strategies and expected results for each phase of the proposed cycle. We have determined that the primary reasons for developing a production cycle for OER's using social authorship are: to allow educators and students to develop resources collaboratively; to reduce the amount of time spent in resource development; and to provide for reutilization of quality OER's. Finally, it should be recognized that the success of the model and its application depends on the institutional context where it is implemented, as well as the policies related to content generation, authorship acknowledgement and distribution of the resources. © 2010 IEEE.","Collaborative learning; Component; Open educational resource; Semantic web; Social authorshi","Collaborative learning; Communication technologies; Descriptive metadata; Digital contents; Educational platforms; Higher education; Instructional model; Open educational resources; Production cycle; Re-utilization; Resource development; Semantic components; Semantic technologies; Social justice; Social Networks; Support tool; Time spent; Web repositories; Education computing; Engineering education; Interoperability; Metadata; Search engines; Semantics; Social networking (online); Semantic Web","D'Antoni, S., (2008) Open Educational Resources the Way Forward, , http://oerwiki.iiepunesco.Org/images/4/46/OER-Way-Forward.pdf, Feb.

Both courses have in common that they include remote experiments and are executed completely online, which is still rarity in the practically oriented engineering education, especially in nonuniversity education. The execution details and educational approach applied in each course were adjusted to two specific target groups. The target groups of a first course 'Control of nonlinear mechanisms' is a group of regular local and regular international students of mechatronics. The target group of second course 'Basics of mechatronics' are employed and unemployed adult professionals from various engineering fields who have already finished their formal education but want to acquire new knowledge. For both courses interactive E-materials and E-tests in Slovene, English and partially also in German language are available within two learning portals, also adjusted to the needs of each target groups. First course was tested with 40 regular students and the second course with the group of 70 adult professionals mostly from industry. While adult professionals appreciated the fact that the course was executed completely online, the regular students have still preferred conventional lectures and especially conventional laboratory exercises over remote ones. Based on the teaching instructor's observances and on the results of anonymous questionnaires, the advantages and disadvantages of the replacement of traditional laboratories with remote laboratories are discussed from a critical point of view. © 2010 IEEE.","Adult education; Distant education; Education; Mechatronics; Remote laboratory; Vocational training","Adult education; Distant education; Remote laboratories; Remote laboratory; Vocational training; Distance education; Engineering education; Equations of state; Knowledge engineering; Laboratories; Mechatronics; Students; Targets; Teaching","Bauer, P., Dudak, J., Maga, D., Hajek, V., Distance practical education for Power Electronics (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (6), pp. 1210-1218; Duan, B., Ling, K.V., Mir, H., Hosseini, M., Gay, R.K.L., An online laboratory framework for control engineering courses (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (6), pp. 1068-1075; Hercog, D., Gergč, B., Uran, S., Jezernik, K., A DSP-based remote control laboratory (2007) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 54 (6), pp. 3057-3068; Jernigan, S.R., Fahmy, F., Bucker, G.D., Implementing a remote laboratory into a joint engineering degree program: Aerodynamics levitation of a beach balls (2009) IEEE Trans.

The traditional ecology guiding service uses static web page or fixed placard to prompt and provide ecology information to learners. It can not provide adaptive learning anytime and anywhere. Learners can not obtain real-time ecology guiding information and have a good adaptive learning based on learners' knowledge background, and time and location. This study proposes a framework based on Scaffolding Theory that provide learners mobile, dynamic and adaptive ecology guiding service to national parks. Scaffolding Theory is to support learners a knowledge structure for systematic learning. Based on Scaffolding Theory, learners are identified by background (e.g. age and gender), knowledge (e.g. cognitive base, knowledge requirement and learning objective), and interests. Moreover, adaptive and appropriate ecology knowledge based on learners' properties is provided dynamically. Furthermore, learning steps and contents are able to be adjusted flexibly by learners' feedback. In addition, this study also adopt context awareness to provide the learner a suitable route planning for ecology guiding service according to environment factors such as weather condition, time and season, prediction of tide, UV rays and rain rate where learners located. Landscapes and ecology events such as Migratory birds in transit within the route can be actively delivered to learners immediately using interactive applications such as multimedia messages (e.g. text, image and video). Attention and enjoyment of learners can be increased and ecology education purpose of national parks can be achieved. © 2010 IEEE.","Context-aware computing; M-learning; Scaffolding theory","Adaptive learning; Context- awareness; Context-aware computing; Guiding information; Interactive applications; Knowledge requirements; Knowledge structures; Learning objectives; M-Learning; Migratory birds; Multimedia messages; National parks; Rain rates; Route planning; Scaffolding theory; Systematic learning; UV rays; Weather conditions; Web page; Ecology; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Parks; User interfaces; Engineering education","(2008) National Parks Exhibition, , Taipei: Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior; http://www.iucn.org/about/, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); McNeely, J.A., (1993) Parks for Life: Report of the IVth World Congress on National Parks and Protected Areas; England, N., (2007) Natural England Corporate Plan 2007-2010; (1994) Guidelines for Protected Area Management Categories, , Cambridge: IUCN; Valentine, P.S., Ecotourism and nature conservation: A definition with some recent developments in micronesia (1993) Tourism Management, 14, pp. 107-115; Sharpley, R., Pearce, T., Tourism, marketing and sustainable development in the english national parks: The role of national park authorities (2007) Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 15, pp. 557-573; (2009), http://np.cpami.gov.tw/, CPAMI; Kenting National Park, , http://www.ktnp.gov.tw/eng/about.aspx; Hwang, S.-N., Lee, C., Chen, H.-J., The relationship among tourists' involvement, place attachment and interpretation satisfaction in Taiwan's national parks (2005) Tourism Management, 26, pp. 143-156. , April 2005; (1990) Interpreter Guidebook of Renting National Park, , Taipei: Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding, Theory; Lin, H.-Y., Chen, C.-Y., Chen, W.-C., Scaffolding m-learning approach of automotive practice courses in senior vocational high school (2008) 38th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference: IEEE; Liu, J., Wong, C.K., Hui, K.K., An adaptive user interface based on personalized learning (2003) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 18, pp. 52-57. , Apr; Dolog, P., Henze, N., Nejdl, W., Sintek, M., Personalization in distributed e-learning environments (2004) Proceedings of the 13th International World Wide Web Conference on Alternate Track Papers & Posters; Conklin, J., Hypertext: An introduction and survey (1987) Computer, 20, pp. 17-41. , Sept; Calvi, L., Bra, P.D., Improving the usability of hypertext courseware through adaptive linking (1997) Proceedings of the Eighth ACM Conference on Hypertext, pp. 224-225. , Southampton, United Kingdom; Perkowitz, M., Etzioni, O., Towards adaptive web sites: Conceptual framework and case study (2000) Artificial Intelligence, 118, pp. 245-275. , April; Farrell, R.G., Liburd, S.D., Thomas, J.C., Dynamic assembly of learning objects (2004) Proceedings of the 13th International World Wide Web Conference on Alternate Track Papers & Posters, pp. 162-169. , New York, USA; Brusilovsky, P., KnowledgeTree: A distributed architecture for adaptive e-learning (2004) Proceedings of the 13th International World Wide Web Conference on Alternate Track Papers & Posters, pp. 104-113. , New York, USA; Ham, S.H., Can interpretation really make a difference?

The system is adapted to multiple LMSs which can be selected by the course professor. In order to widely cooperate with other systems, the system is designed by using global standards (IMS Enterprise, JSR-168 Portlet, etc.) and open source software (uPortal, CAS, JSF, Hibernate, etc.) as possible as we can.

This case designed a platform of game-based learning for IM students' studying based on course of project management. Using a sample of 54 sophomores in Taiwan, a modified TAM model, self-efficacy and flow experience in playfulness were examined using experimental design and causal analysis for learner's attitude and behavior. A knowledge test is conducted to inspect the learning performance with platform support. Test results present higher performance in posttest than in pretest. The empirical results show that self-efficacy has significant, positive effects on perceived usefulness; but not significance on perceived usefulness. Perceived ease of use is positive influence on perceived usefulness on flow experience. In addition, it was found that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, positively influence IM students' attitude to use game-based learning platform, and flow experience not significantly effect on attitude to use game-based learning platform, whereas attitude toward game-based learning platform has a significant, positive impact on behavioral intentions, and the behavioral intentions has positively significant impact on actual platform use based on course of project management.

At pedagogical level, the use of a virtual laboratory facilitates the learning of certain matters, acting as a connection between the theoretical contents of a communications system course and their practical understanding and experimentation. Furthermore, LAVICAD provides resources for professors to organize different teaching activities in their courses. These activities can be used in different environments as for instance in a classroom given in the context of a full attendance course or in a homework activity at a distance learning course. The aim of this paper is two-fold: On one hand to describe the main technical features that make LAVICAD an original fully reusable and reprogrammable tool in signal processing and communication systems courses. On the other hand to show some preliminary academic results obtained with the use of LAVICAD verifying how it improves the level of success. © 2010 IEEE.","E-learning; Reusability; User friendly environment; Virtual laboratory; Web-based labs","Communications systems; Digital communications; Distance learning course; Educational platforms; Interactive tool; Reprogrammable; Signal processing technique; Technical features; User friendly; Virtual laboratories; Virtual laboratory; Communication systems; Curricula; Digital communication systems; E-learning; Engineering education; Laboratories; Reusability; Signal processing; Teaching","Proakis, J.G., Communication Systems, , ed.

With their strong professional background and some theoretical aspects linked to scientific and technological domains, they become more helpful for the companies and for the society they belong. Considering these facts, the Portuguese Government developed specific legislation to attract new students for the technological higher education system. This legislation, intends to attract students older than 23, and also aims the improvement of technological education after the secondary school level. Pursuing this goal the Technological Specialization Courses (TSC) were created. The TSC are post-secondary, non superior training courses that will lead the students to obtain level 4 of professional training, according the 85/368/CEE decision of the European Union Council, published on the European Communities official journal. The TSC also allow people from different professional backgrounds to get technological training. The best students are allowed to access higher education in technological domains (basically in Engineering fields) and/or to the job market relied with the country's technological industries. Before the beginning of a TSC, the students are submitted to technological tests to determine their profile, which will be taken into account on the initial training, before the starting of the TSC. In this paper, the success of TSC courses in Portuguese context is demonstrated, and the implementation of a successful partnership between University of Minho and the Technological Association for the Professional Education of Beira Interior (AFTEBI) is shown. The illustration of the successful partnership is done by presenting a case study of a TSC in Industrial Maintenance where the best students can pursue their studies in University of Minho, in the Mechanical Engineering Department in order to obtain a Mechanical Engineering Degree. The main role of UMinho (as Superior Education Institution) at different levels of this post-secondary (non superior) education is also discussed and highlighted. © 2010 IEEE.","Engineering education; Higher education; Professional training","Education institutions; Engineering fields; European community; European Countries; European Union; Higher education; Higher education system; Industrial maintenance; Job market; Level 4; Mechanical Engineering Department; Portugal; Professional education; Professional training; Secondary schools; Social conditions; Theoretical aspects; Training course; Engineering education; Mechanical engineering; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Teaching; Students","Monteiro, A., Silva, J., Marcos, A., Valbom, L., The unavoidability of virtual reality in technological societies' learning activities (2007) Proceedings of COBEM 2007, 19th International Congress of Mechanical Engineering, , November, Brasília; (2009) Realidade Empresarial Transf Ronteiriça Galiza-Norte D e Portugal, , www.eures-norteportugal-galicia.org, AIM-CEP, accessed on the May 27 th; Pinto, A., (2007) O Reconheci Mento, Validação e Certif Icação de Competências Profissionais - RVCC- PRO: Uma Oportunidade Paraos Trabalhadores e Para As Empresas, , www.cenflm.pt, CENFIM; (2009), p. 5635. , Lei 85/2009; Diário da República, 1."" série - N.° 166-27 de Agosto de; (2008), SOPROFOR, Lda Relatório de Ava liação Externa, Candidatura N° 02/00136, Sociedade Promotora de Formação; Velde, C., An alternative conception of competence: Implication for vocational education (1999) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, , London: Triangle; Biemans, H., Poell, R., Nieuwenhuis, A., Mulder, M., Investigating competene-based education in the Nether lands: Backgrounds, pit falls and im plications (2003) Conference Paper ECER, , Wageningen: Education and Competence Studies; Machado, J., Seabra, E., Higher competency-based education in automation teaching (2008) Proceedings of International Conference on Engineering Education -ICEE 2008, , Pécs- Budapest, Hungary, July 27th-31st; Machado, J., Seabra, E., Automation Systems Design using Advanced Computational Tools (2008) Proceedings of the 53rd International Scientific Colloquim of the Technical University of Ilmenau53.IWK'08, , Ilmenau - Germany, September 07th-12th; Bologna declaration (2009) European Higher Education Area: Joint Declaration of the European Ministers of Education, , http://www.bologn.a-bergen2005.no/Docs/00Maindoc/ 990719BOLOGNA_DECLARATION.PDF, EHEA, accessed on the May 27th; Pina Neves, S., Lima Santos, N., E studo di ferencial dos valores profissionais entre adolescentes portugueses (2001) Actas D O VI Congresso Galaico-Português de Psicopedagogia, 2, pp. 845-858. , Braga; Parry, S.B., Evaluating the impact of training (1997) A Merican Society for Training & Development, , ISBN-10: 1562860631","Machado, J.; Mechanical Engineering Department, , Guimarães, Portugal; email: jmachado@dem.uminho.pt",,9781424465682,,"English","IEEE Educ.

For building the proposal, eleven pre-defined competences were ranked and a different weight was assigned to each one. The ranking was made individually by all the authors following a blind two-step process. The first step consisted in ordering the competences by relevance and the second step in grading that relevance for each pair of competences having consecutive positions in the list. As a result, an overall weight was computed for each competence and the final proposal was produced by averaging the individual proposals. In addition, three moments are defined for the assessment of FYPs: the FYP process itself, the written report and the oral presentation. Bearing in mind this, the competences that can be evaluated in each moment are identified and a specific assessment form for each moment is also proposed. © 2010 IEEE.","Competence-based learning; Component; Engineering education; Final year projects; Student assessment","Competence-based learning; Component engineering; Oral presentations; Student assessment; Two-step process; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","McDermott, K., Nafalski, A., Gol, O., Project-based teaching in engineering programs (2007) 37th Annu.

The capstone design course often plays a critical role in this, but there are numerous questions on how best to teach design and what are the characteristics of realistic design problems which provide excellent learning opportunities. This paper reports on a controlled evaluation of the effects of design problem complexity on students' ability to functionally abstract a design problem and its effect on their perceived value for variety of design methods. It is important for students to learn a systematic approach to the design process and to perceive its effectiveness. Students' perceptions and functional modeling skill are measured. Results, while preliminary due to limited sample size, indicate the complexity of the design problem is a critical factor in teaching design methods. There is a statistical interaction between the complexity of the design problem and opinion of functional modeling on their ability. Results also indicate that students who work on more complex design problems are more likely to expect to use functional modeling in the future. More complex design problems lead to a more positive student opinion. Further development of the functional modeling quiz is needed as is a larger sample size. Overall, results indicate that more complex design problem demonstrate to the students the effectiveness of the methods. © 2010 IEEE.","Design methodology; Engineering education; Functional modeling","Capstone design course; Complex design problems; Critical factors; Design method; Design methodology; Design problems; Design process; Design skills; Design-problem complexity; Educational challenge; Functional modeling; Further development; Learning opportunity; Perceived value; Real-world designs; Sample sizes; Statistical interaction; Student perceptions; Design; Engineering education; Students; Curricula","Otto, K., Wood, K., (2001) Product Design: Techniques in Reverse Engineering and New Product Development, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering; Radcliffe, D.F., Lee, T.Y., Design methods used by undergraduate engineering students (1989) Design Studies, 10, pp. 199-207; Fricke, G., Successful approaches in dealing with differently precise design problems (1999) Design Studies, 20, pp. 417-429; (2009) Capstone Design Conference 2010, , http://www.capstoneconf.org, accessed 11/1; Wood, K.L., Jensen, D., Bezdek, J., Otto, K., Reverse engineering and redesign: Courses to incrementally and systematically teach design (2001) Journal of Engineering Education, 1, pp. 363-374. , July; Abdolmohammadi, M., Wright, A., An examination of the effects of experience and task complexity on audit judgments (1987) The Accounting Review, 62, pp. 1-13; Hoover, S.P., Rinderle, J.R., Finger, S., Models and abstractions in design (1991) Design Studies, 12, pp. 237-245; Lalk, T.R., Cohen, A., The structure and conduct of a capstone systems engineering design course (2001) ASEE Regional Conference, , College Station, TX, April; Blanchard, B.S., Fabrycky, W.J., (2005) Systems Engineering and Analysis, , 4th ed; Howell, D.C., (2002) Statistical Methods for Psychology, , 5th ed.

Hence, a middleware is necessary to connect any LMS with our own FIS, which will provide us a scalable, robust, easy integration in any LMS. This project aims to solve the problems of identity authentication of users in remote or virtual environments whose use has spread both in distance education and traditional universities. It seeks its integration into traditional and remote environments, and in the remote environment in exams as well as virtual labs. The project aims to cover all the weaknesses that traditionally have the password or user name. The implementation starts from the own fingerprint identification system developed to its final integration in the LMS. © 2010 IEEE.","Evaluation; Fingerprint identification system; Learning management system; Middleware; Virtual labs","Empirical analysis; Evaluation; Fingerprint identification; Identity authentication; Learning management system; Remote environment; Traditional universities; User name; Virtual environments; Virtual lab; Authentication; Distance education; Management; Middleware; Virtual reality; Engineering education","Reid, P., (2004) Biometrics for Network Security., , Ed.

However, there is a need for further research on abstraction to provide a more instructional view in the context of authoring tools in a variety of ways, in order to avoid being driven by Learning Technology (LT) specifications, facilitate instructional knowledge aggregation, and to provide an appropriate level of clarity and semantics in the design of collaborative activities. We propose a combination of techniques to provide this instructional abstraction in the context of the new European educational model, combining instructional layers and collaborative scripts in authoring tools, and semantic web techniques for extending e-learning material in order to harness the wealth of existing web content and semantically labeled repositories. © 2010 IEEE.","Collaborative learning; E-learning content modeling; E-learning standards; Educational authoring; Semantic web","Authoring tool; Collaborative activities; Collaborative learning; Core factors; E-learning content modeling; E-learning environment; E-learning materials; Educational authoring; Educational models; Knowledge aggregation; Learning technology; Semantic-Web techniques; Virtual learning environments; Web content; Abstracting; E-learning; Interoperability; Semantic Web; Semantics; Standardization; Engineering education","Boyle, T., Design principles for authoring dynamic, reusable learning objects in (2003) Australian Journal of Educational Technology, 2003 (191), pp. 46-58; Rodríguez-Artacho, M., Verdejo Maíllo, M.F., Modeling educational content: The cognitive approach of the PALO language (2004) Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 7 (3), pp. 124-137; Devedzic, V., Education and the semantic Web (2004) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 39-65. , http://fon.fon.bg.ac.yu/~devedzic/IJAIED2004.pdf, #14 (2004) IOS Press.

Humans have a complex psycho-pedagogic model, the result of millions of years of evolution. This model compromises very often the educational structures, because each of us - despite we can be inserted in specific groups, have a personal learning curve. Like nature, that develops special strategies for the evolution of the species, it is possible to find the correct individual learning path, using one of the oldest Mother Nature mechanisms - evolutive genetic. Using tools like JAVA, XML (extensible Markup Language), an open source LMS (Learning Management System), i.e. Moodle, a standard as SCORM (Sharable Content Reference Model), all controlled by a GA (Genetic Algorithm), it is possible to achieve a flexible platform to help all the educational process actors. The goal is to create a self universal monitoring and learning system,which follows the progression of individual learning - by using a mathematical function applied to a genetic algorithm, maximizing the results and achieve the subject ""learning curve"". © 2010 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm; Java; SCORM; XML","E-learning platforms; Educational process; Flexible platforms; GA (genetic algorithm); Individual learning; Java; Learning curves; Learning management system; Mathematical functions; New approaches; Open sources; Personal learning; Reference models; XML (extensible markup language); Biology; Engineering education; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Hypertext systems; Java programming language; Markup languages; Multi agent systems; Patient monitoring; Query languages; XML; Learning algorithms","Spiegel Murray, R., (1994) Estatística, MAKRON Books Do Brasil Editora Lda, 3. , Edição, São Paulo, Brasil; Feldman Robert, S., (2001) Compreender A Psicologia, Editora McGraw-Hill de Portugal, , 5a Edição, Lisboa, Portugal; Tattersall, C., Burgos, D., Vogten, H., Martens, H., Koper, R., (2004) How to Use IMS Learning Design and SCORM 2004 Together, , SCORM 2006 Taipei, Educational Technology Expertise Centre, Open University of the Netherlands, Netherlands","Pires, J.

Both aspects are very relevant to the need of keeping learning institutions as much independent as possible from software vendors. Content independence and interoperability is also required to easily share and move elearning repositories. We propose a user friendly authoring environment based on the independent, open and XML compliant product Docbook; its simple, flexible and well structured markup make it easy to interoperate with other XML languages, particularly those related to e-learning. We are particularly interested in IMS Content Packaging and IMS QTI because they allow importing learning material into our Sakai based learning management system named PoliformaT. Docbook has also a powerful and fully customizable set of XSLT styles sheets that allow high quality web and paper delivery. The user front end is built on the commercial XML editor from XMLmind XXE. The major part of the environment is portable to other XML editors because it relies exclusively on Docbook components. At the moment the proposal presented is much more flexible, usable and productive than the available alternatives. © 2010 IEEE.","Docbook; E-learning; IMS; Interoperable formats; XML","Authoring environments; Customizable; Docbook; Front end; High quality; IMS; IMS content packaging; IMS QTI; Learning management system; Learning materials; Paper delivery; Software vendors; User friendly; XML format; XML languages; XML-editors; E-learning; Markup languages; Paper sheeting; XML; Engineering education","http://www.docbook.org, Docbook main sites. http://docbook.sourceforge.net; http://www.imsglobal.org, IMS Global Learning Consortium site; Martínez-Ortiz, I., Moreno-Ger, P., Sierra-Rodríguez, J.L., Fernández-Manjón, B., Using DocBook and XML technologies to create adaptive learning content in technical domains (2006) Internationa Journal of Computer Science and Applications, 3 (2), pp. 91-108; Koper, R., Manderveld, J., Educational modelling language: Modelling reusable, rich and personalised units of learning (2004) British Journal of Educational Technology, 35, pp. 537-576; Walsh, L., Using extensible markup languages for the single source delivery of teaching resources via print and the web: A practical example (2004) Australian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education ASCILITE, pp. 913-923. , Perth; Delgado, C., Pardo, A., Muñoz, M., De La Fuente, L., E-LANE: An elearning initiative based on open source as a basis for sustainability (2007) Int.

In distance education, the learning of engineering subjects has a special difficulty, which can be reduced by means of the use of new technologies, and the practice of mixed models of learning. One of these processes is the deep drawing due to its relevance in the industry. This paper presents a deep drawing tool for e-learning. The tool has been realized for its use in the Master degree because it requires advanced knowledge in manufacturing processes. The instrument has been developed with the objective of the students who can: a) Select input data for get the formability of material to deep drawing; b) Select the process that provides the best solution from a technological perspective; c) Optimize the process for saving the material; d) Know the influence of the punch in the results; e) Consideration of the process cost. The structure of the system has three subsystems: a) Solve, module for data processing and the generation of results; b) Materials, module for management data of the system; and c) Interface, module for user interaction. The tool has been implemented in the software tool programming, developed in Java. This language has been selected because it provides a methodology of object-oriented programming and its execution is possible in multiple operating systems. The paper describes each step of the tool, from the input data to final analysis and they are shown through the results given by the tool. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; Computer aided engineering formatting; Engineering education; Manufacturing; Manufacturing data processing; Manufacturing planning","Component; Input datas; Management data; Manufacturing; Manufacturing engineering education; Manufacturing planning; Manufacturing process; Master degree; Mixed models; Multiple operating systems; New technologies; Process costs; Software tool; Technological perspective; User interaction; Computer aided engineering; Computer software; Deep drawing; E-learning; Education computing; Industrial engineering; Input output programs; Java programming language; Manufacture; Manufacturing data processing; Models; Object oriented programming; Production engineering; Engineering education","Castro, M., Aldea, E.L., Garcia-Sevilla, R., Gil, F., Sanoristobal, E., Diaz, G., Vara, A., Peire, J., New laboratory working procedure considerations for electronic learning in a mixed (distance/online/traditional) model (2006) 13th IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference (MELECON) Spain, p. 1217; Ramírez, F.J., Domingo, R., (2009) Application of An Aided System to Multi-step Deep Drawing Process in the Brass Pieces Manufacturing, p. 8. , MESIC Spain; Lange, K., (1985) Handbook of Metal Forming, , McGraw-Hill; Ford, H., (1986) Advanced Mechanics of Materials, , Ellis Horwood Limited; Hassan, M.A., Takatura, N., Yamaguchi, K., A novel technique of friction aided deep drawing using a blank-holder divided into four segments (2003) J.

Usually the basic functionalities in that respect support grouping students and providing communication features so that they are able to communicate with each other. However, related collaborative learning and CSCL studies and developments, which have been investigating how to manage, promote, analyze and evaluate collaborative features for decades conclude that there is no easy way, and much less standards-based approaches to support effective collaboration. The mere use of a typical set of communication services (such as forums, chat, etc.) does not guarantee collaborative learning. Further, managing collaborative settings in those LMS approaches is usually a time consuming task, especially considering that a frequent and regular analysis of the group's collaboration process is advisable when following and managing the collaborative processes. To improve collaborative learning in those situations we provide tutors and learners with timely information on learners' collaboration in a domain independent way so that the model can be transferred to other domains and educational environments. After setting a collaborative experience in an open and standards-based LMS, we have analyzed, through various data mining techniques, the learners' interaction in forums during three consecutive academic years. From that analysis we have built a metric with statistical indicators to rank learners' according to their collaboration. We have shown that this rank helps learners and tutors to evaluate the collaborative work and identify possible problems as they arise. © 2010 IEEE.","Collaboration; Data mining; Distance education learners","Collaboration; Collaboration process; Collaborative learning; Collaborative process; Collaborative settings; Collaborative Work; Communication features; Communication service; Data mining techniques; Educational environment; Learning management system; Statistical indicators; Time-consuming tasks; Data mining; Distance education; Distributed computer systems; Education computing; Interoperability; Learning systems; Engineering education","Anaya, A.R., Boticario, F.G., A data mining approach to reveal representative collaboration indicators in open collaboration frameworks (2009) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Educational Data Mining, , (EDM09), 2009; Barkley, E., Cross, K.P., Major, C.H., (2004) Collaborative Learning Techniques: A Practical Guide to Promoting Learning in Groups, , San Francisco,Cal.: Jossey Bass; Berikov, V., Litvinenko, A., (2003) Methods for Statistical Data Analysis with Decision Trees, , Novosibirsk, Sobolev Institute of Mathematics; Boticario, J.G., Gaudioso, E., Adaptive web-site for distance learning.

The case-study reported here originally set out to use Gibbons' models to characterize the work of a group of Portuguese engineering researchers over a 15-year period. The study employs a qualitative methodology and narrative approach to characterize practice within this group of engineers so as to look for appropriate lessons that can be applied to engineering education to better prepare future professionals. Analysis of the information gathered during the study has caused us to question our original model of engineering practice and leads us to the conclusion that the Unifying Model recently proposed by Trevelyan [2] could represent a better fit to characterize the activities of this group and would suggest a need to gather empirical data on engineering practice. © 2010 IEEE.","Case study; Engineering practice; Knowledge production; Model","Empirical data; Engineering practices; Knowledge production; New production; Original model; Qualitative methodologies; Engineering education; Engineers; Models; Research; Spheres; Knowledge engineering","Gibbons, M., (1994) The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies, , Sage Publications, London; Trevelyan, J.P., Steps toward a better model, of engineering practice (2009) The Research in Engineering Education Symposium, , Cairns, Queensland, Australia; Figueiredo, A.D., Cunha, P.R., Action research and design in information systems, two Faces of a single coin (2006) Information Systems Action Research: Bridging the IndustryUniversity Technology Gap, , Chapter 5, Ned Kock (Editor), Springer /Kluwer; Jorgensen, U., Engineering design in theory, teaching, and practice - The Construction of design synthesis and methods and contemporary challenges (2008) Global Perspectives on Engineering, International Network for Engineering Studies Workshop, , http://www.in.esweb.org/node/202on30March2009, Lisbon; (2009) ""Business Innovation Survey Report (2009), Portugal,"" (In Portuguese), , http://www.strategos.com/articl.es/Strategos_BIS2009_.Report.pdf, on 30 October; Creswell, J.W., (2007) Qualitative Inquiry and Research DesigmChoosing among Five Approaches, 361, p. 52. , 2nd edition.

An analysis of major issues on sensor education is carried out and two types of didactic, capacitive and low cost sensors are presented, which allow the student to easily under-stand the physical principle of the measurement, as well as to evaluate other sensor features like repeatability, sensitivity and measurement uncertainty. To this aim, some capacitive sensors have been developed to measure levels of oil and water in the laboratories. In the academic year 2006-07, the Laboratory of Sensors and Signal Conditioning of the Electronic Technology Department of the University of Vigo started using those sensors experimentally. During 2007-08 and 2008-09, a methodology based on these didactic sensors, combined with signal conditioning circuits and simulations in Pspice, has been launched. Then, a signal conditioning circuit is assembled and the information displayed on a PC monitor, connected by a data acquisition system. Furthermore, this paper includes the efficiency evaluation results of the proposed methodology, obtained from student surveys. © 2010 IEEE.","Capacitance transducers; Circuit simulation; Learning systems; Level measurement","Capacitance transducers; Capacitive sensor; Data acquisition system; Efficiency evaluation; Electronic technologies; Laboratory class; Low costs; Low-cost sensors; Measurement uncertainty; PC monitors; Physical principles; Signal conditioning; Signal conditioning circuits; Student surveys; Capacitance; Circuit simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Engineering education; Force measurement; Learning systems; Level measurement; SPICE; Strain measurement; Students; Teaching; Transducers; Transmitters; Uncertainty analysis; Sensors","(2001) Data Acquisition and Control Handbook, , Keithley Instruments, Inc; USB-6008/6009 User Guide and Specifications, , http://www.ni.com, National Instruments Corporation, Online; http://www.ni.com, National Instruments Corporation, LabView Online; Pallás-Areny, R., Webster, J.G., (2001) Sensors and Signal Conditioning, , John Wiley & Sons; Quintáns, C., Marcos, J., Fariña, J., (2008) Desarrollo de Sensores Capacitivos de Bajo Coste Para Laboratorios Docentes, , Tecnologías Aplicadas a la Enseñanza de la Electrónica (TAEE 2008), Zaragoza, Spain, jul; Acevedo, J.M., Quintáns, C., Combinación de la simulación y los sensores didácticos para la formación en instrumentación (2008) Seminario Anual de Automática, Electrónica e Instrumentación (SAAEI 2008), , Cartagena, Spain, sep; (1995) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, , 1st edition, corrected and reprinted, International Organization for Standardization (Geneva, Switzerland); Quintáns, C., (2008) Simulación de Circuitos Electrónicos Con OrCAD 16 DEMO, , Marcombo","Quintáns, C.; Department of Electronic Technology, , Vigo, Spain; email: quintans@uvigo.es",,9781424465682,,"English","IEEE Educ.

Olin College of Engineering, Needham, MA, United States","Calls for educational reform emphasize the need for student-centered learning approaches that foster lifelong learning. To be a lifelong learner includes characteristics consistent with those of self-directed learners, such as being curious, motivated, reflective, analytical, persistent, flexible, and independent. Educational research has shown that the building of these aptitudes involves a complex interplay among nearly every aspect of human development. Instructor support of students' self-directed learning (SDL) development relies on understanding and balancing these factors in the classroom. Engineering educators play a critical role in influencing outcomes related to SDL through their design of courses that support students' transitions from controlled to autonomous learning behaviors. This study will examine a variety of engineering courses and pedagogical approaches. Each will be characterized using instructor course information, videotaped classroom observations of instructor-student and student-student interactions, student and instructor responses to surveys, and focus groups. Finally, the students' capacity for SDL will be measured using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. This approach should provide for rich, contextualized descriptions of what instructors and learners do, how instructors and students relate to each other, and how students view their classrooms. This work-in-progress paper will describe our initial work in this multiyear study. © 2010 IEEE.","Autonomy support; Lifelong learning; Self-directed learning","Autonomous learning; Classroom environment; Course information; Educational reforms; Educational research; Engineering course; Engineering educators; Focus groups; Human development; Life long learning; Life-long learners; Pedagogical approach; SDL; Self-directed learning; Student-centered learning; Student-student interaction; Work-in-progress; Curricula; Engineering education; Learning systems; School buildings; Teaching; Video recording; Students","(1994) The Green Report: Engineering Education for A Changing World, , American Society for Engineering Education Deans Council and Corporate Roundtable, Washington, D.C: ASEE; (1995) Engineering Education: Designing An Adaptive System, , National Research Council's Board on Engineering Education, Washington, D.C: National Academy Press; Peden, I.C., Ernst, E.W., Prados, J.W., (1995) Systemic Engineering Education Reform: An Action Agenda Washington, D.C.: National Science Foundation; (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy Press (U.S.), Washington DC; Clough, G., (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century., , National Academy of Engineering, Washington, DC; (2005) Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology Engineering Accreditation Commission, , http://www.abet.org/forms.shtml, Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs; Litzinger, T., Wise, J., Lee, S., Bjorkund, S., Assessing readiness for self - directed learning (2003) Proceedings, ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, , http://www.asee.org/acPapers/2003-1429-Final.pdf, 2 July 2003; Fowler, D., Maxwell, D., Froyd, J., Learning Strategy Growth Not What Expected after Two Years through Engineering curriculum (2003) Proceeding, ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , http://www.asee.org/acPapers/2003-534Final.pdf, 2 July 2003; Blumberg, B., Evaluating the Evidence that Problem-Based Learners are Self-Directed Learners: A Review of the Literature (2000) Problem - Based Learning: A Research Perspective on Learning Interactions, pp. 199-226. , D.H.

OMNotebook can be an alternative or complementary tool to the traditional teaching method with lecturing and reading textbooks. Experience shows that using such an electronic book will lead to more engagement from the students. OMNotebook can contain technical computations and text, as well as graphics. Hence it is a suitable tool for teaching, experimentation, simulation, scripting, model documentation, storage, etc. OMNotebook is part of the open source platform OpenModelica. It is already used for the course material DrModelica in teaching the Modelica language but can easily be adapted to other programming languages which is also shown in this paper. The notebook can also be adapted to other areas, such as physics, chemistry, biology, biomechanics etc., where phenomena can be illustrated by dynamic simulations within the notebook. The idea behind this paper is to show that by using a standardized interface the notebook can be extended to any computer language, i.e., being language independent. This is shown in the form of an implementation and adaptation of the notebook to support the Scheme language. © 2010 IEEE.","DrModelica; Eletronic notebook; OpenModelica; Scheme","Complementary tools; Computer language; Course material; Dynamic simulation; Electronic books; Electronic notebooks; Modelica language; Open source platforms; Programming language; Scheme languages; Standardized interfaces; Teaching methods; Biomechanics; Computer programming; Computer simulation; Education computing; Electronic document exchange; Electronic publishing; Engineering education; Linguistics; Query languages; Teaching","(2009) The Modelica Language Specification, , www.modelica.org, Modelica Association.

These activities should stimulate the student's professional skills and, in the particular case of a Master Degree, this is even more complicated. It represents a higher educational level where students should increase and improve their ability to solve problems related to very different areas such as the engineering and biomedical. The Biomedical Master Degree shared between the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya and the Universitat de Barcelona has students coming with extremely different backgrounds, from the medical or biological to the engineering profile. Taking into account this situation, we have developed a 4-days multidisciplinary charge activity in a particular course of Biomedical Devices. It is focused on the amperometric sensors and in the conception and application of biopotentiostat amplifiers. Regardless the student's profile the activity is focused in such a way that everyone has to work actively in the experience. This paper presents a proposal based on cooperative learning strategy and the feedback that students give to the learning process as a first approach for future improvements. © 2010 IEEE.","Analog electronics teaching; Biomedical engineering education; Workgroup teaching","Analog electronics teaching; Barcelona; Biomedical devices; Biomedical engineers; Cooperative learning; Learning process; Master degree; Multi-disciplinary activities; Professional skills; Workgroup teaching; Amperometric sensors; Biomedical engineering; Biophysics; Electronic medical equipment; Engineering; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-leaming-policy/doc48-en.htm; Adam, S., Gehmlich, V., (2000) ECTS Extension Feasibility Project, , http://europa.eu.int/comm/educatioii/socrates/ectsext.html, Available on the European Commission; (2006) Recognition in the Bologna Process: Policy Development and the Road to Good Practice, , S.

Communities support education and retraining in order to retain the human talent. This paper describes an innovative approach to helping engineers overcome barriers to career transitions, which incorporates career and personal development, an engineering skills refresher, a semester-long course at a top-tier engineering school, and an internship at a company in a high-growth sector. We describe the motivation for embarking on a career reengineering program. A large percentage of the engineering population in the Austin community is engaged in semiconductor design and manufacturing, an industry in decline. In order to harness the collective skills and talents of engineers in the semiconductor industry and to redirect those skills, the Center for Lifelong Engineering Education provides training to help engineers to re-tool their skills for growth industries. We describe success factors for a career re-engineering program, including (1) the engagement with multiple stakeholders: a university engineering faculty, community development organizations such as workforce commissions, companies in high-growth sectors, the university career counseling center, and governmental agencies; (2) the acquisition of funding to help support engineers as they embark on a retraining curriculum; and (3) the application process and selection criteria. We describe the curriculum, including an initial orientation and assessment program; the selection of appropriate and available fall-semester engineering classes in fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and environmental sciences; monthly workshops designed to improve communication, presentation, adaptability, and networking skills; weekly smallteam meetings designed to keep participants accountable; regular meetings with individual mentors; and a spring-semester internship with a firm in a high-growth sector.

The general question behind our practical approach is: ""How well do different eLearning solutions provide functionality to realize a blended learning course, which is designed according to specific educational principles?"" To approach a response to this question for our case, one typical person-centered blended learning course was implemented in three different eLearning solutions, namely Moodle, Fronter and CEWebS. The resulting realizations of the course and the necessary actions are documented and compared in this paper. The investigated eLearning platforms provided sufficient functionality to accomplish many of the basic tasks in the daily course routine more or less effectively. For tasks beyond the basic functionality of a solution, either the employment of extensions or customizations were necessary, resulting in an implementation that was in some aspects quite elaborated. © 2010 IEEE.","Blended learning; Learning management systems; Person-centered learning","Blended learning; E-learning platforms; Educational principles; Learning management system; Management; Engineering education","Motschnig-Pitrik, R., Person-centered e-learning in action.

Recent research, sponsored by the NSF ADVANCE program, was performed mostly by doctoral institutions. However, for small undergraduate universities, the resulting challenges and decision frameworks are likely to be different. The prevalent recommendations need to be re-evaluated and re-interpreted for relevance and applicability. Multiple change agents have been identified, but it is believed that the departmental climate most strongly correlates with successful institutional transformation. The primary success factor is a set of formalized processes in: (1) teaching, scholarship and service, (2) mentoring, and (3) leadership. A secondary factor is a faculty support infrastructure capable of fostering collaborations and reducing isolation. A third factor is an introspective capability that broadens the understanding of the issues affecting women ultimately expressed in the form of better policies and procedures. There is a strong connection between gender progress on the faculty side and improving the pipeline of female students. To effectively intervene on the supply side, it is important to have networking, mentoring and role modeling processes that match student demographics and global sociological conditions. In the case of our University, this requires recruiting, developing and retaining faculty whose principal focus is undergraduate education which is challenging in STEM fields where the traditional emphasis is on research. Curricular evolution in doctoral institutions is typically driven by emerging trends and technological opportunities while the needs of regional industries and local programs are more influential among primarily undergraduate institutions. As advanced degrees become a professional requirement, baccalaureate graduates will be expected to pursue advanced studies early in their career. Hence, more undergraduate STEM programs will serve as feeders to doctoral institutions. The future supply of graduate students and ultimately faculty will become more dependent on these teaching universities. This paper describes our specific efforts and successes in the context of an undergraduate teaching institution. We have demonstrated that even with limited resources and no external funding, it is possible to improve the community culture and climate. Tangible strategies and initiatives aimed at improving the climate are presented: (1) administrative leadership commitment, (2) grants and endowments, (3) faculty development resources, (4) workshops that mirror industry successes, (5) early and mid-career planning, and (6) recruiting and retention of female faculty. © 2010 IEEE.","Female faculty; Gender balance; Recruiting; Student retention","Career planning; Change agents; Decision framework; Emerging trends; External funding; Faculty development; Faculty support; Female faculty; Female students; Graduate students; Institutional transformation; NSF-ADVANCE program; Role modeling; STEM fields; STEM program; Student demographics; Student retention; Success factors; Technological opportunity; Undergraduate education; Undergraduate institutions; Undergraduate teaching; Biographies; Climate change; Competitive intelligence; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","(2006) To Recruit and Advance: Women Students and Faculty in Science and Engineering, , Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientist and Engineers in Academia, Committee on women in Science and Engineering, Policy and Global Affairs Washington, D.C.: National Research Council; Constant, K., Bird, S., Hamrick, F., Advancing women faculty in engineering through institutional transformation: The Iowa state university ADVANCE program in the college of engineering ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, , Pittsburgh, PA, Paper 2008-1103; Hawkes, N., Morrison, J., Raghavendra, C., The women in science and engineering (WISE) program at the university of southern California: Achievements and challanges of the first five years ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, , Honolulu, HI, Paper 2007-1145; Hopkins, N., Diversification of a university faculty: Observations on hiring women faculty in the schools of science and engineering at MIT (2006) MIT Faculty Newsletter, 53, p. 4; Layne, P., Creamer, E., Hyer, P., Eckel, C., Developing and implementing guidelines for dual career hires (2005) ASEE Annual Confeence Proceedings, , Portland, OR; Posey, E., Renner-Martinez, J., Focusing the lens on women faculty issues: Three years of ADVANCE at the university of Texas at El Paso ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, , Chicago, IL, Paper 2006-939; Reinehart, J., Woods, S., Richards-Kortum, R., Demistifying the faculty search process: Increasing women's pursuit of academic careers through knowledge and networking (2008) ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, , Pittsburgh, PA Paper 2008-1626; Schrader, C., Hampikian, J., Moll, A., What women want: Femalefriendly faculty recruitment ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, , Chicago, IL, Paper 2006-2371; Silver, B., Boudreaux-Bartels, G., Merderer, H., Pasquerella, L., Peckham, J., River-Hude, M., Wishner, K., A warmer climate for women in engineering ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, , Chicago, IL, Paper 2006-2414; http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/advance/index.jsp; Eckel, P., Green, M., Hill, B., Riding the waves of change: Insights from transforming institutions (2001) On Change v Working An Occasional Paper Series of the ACE Project on Leadership and Institutional Transformation and the Kellogg Forum on Higher Education Transformation, , Washington, D.C.: American Council on Education; Litzler, E., Claiborne, C., Brainard, S., Five years later: The institutionalization and sustainability of ADVANCE ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, , Honolulu, HI, Paper 2007-1172; Yen, J.W., Quinn, K., Lange, S.E., Riskin, E.A., Denton, D.D., ADVANCE mentoring program for women faculty in SEM at the university of Washington (2005) Proceedings of the; Sands, R.G., Parson, L.A., Duane, J., Faculty mentoring faculty in a public university (1991) The Journal of Higher Education, 62 (2), pp. 174-193; Harrison, W., University of Hartford UNOTESdaily, , http://www.hartford.edu/daily/articles.asp?MainID=6609&Category=1, 8/27/2009","Eppes, T.

We adopt a broad definition of learning context, encompassing learning domains and learner competencies. Context-based learning requires dealing with three major research thrusts: pedagogical categorization, learner modeling, and context matching techniques. The system architecture relies on a context matching engine and a set of pedagogical learning patterns to re-purpose learning objects according to contextual situations. A prototype is implemented on top of a common learning service registry, which supplies learning schema that map a given learning context and a learner profile, as well as instances of instructional learning services. © 2010 IEEE.","Design patterns; Learning design; Learning personalization; Pedagogy; Semantic web; Web services","Design Patterns; Learning designs; Learning personalization; Pedagogy; Personalizations; Design; Java programming language; Learning systems; Semantic Web; Semantics; Web services; Engineering education","Iyad AlAgha and Liz Burd Towards a constructivist approach to learning from hypertext (2009) ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia; Atif, Y., Benlamri, R., Berri, J., Learning objects based framework for self-adaptive learning (2003) Journal of Education and Information Technologies, 8 (4), pp. 345-368. , Kluwer Academic Publishing; Atif, Y., Benlamri, R., Berri, J., Can e-leaming be made real-time?

We analyzed the self-reflections made by the students about their study habits and about the skills they acquired in the course. This particular course uses a methodology of blended-learning supported by an automatic judge. The research data were obtained through questionnaires that were distributed and collected during the period of study between the end of classes and the exam. We took into account data from other instruments related to previous work carried out by students, in this course and in previous courses, as well as the performance of the students. We intended to ascertain to what extent the planning, motivation, previous study or knowledge about the type of examination influenced final results.

In the field of languages, the Council of Europe has developed the Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR), which aims to provide a reference framework for describing different qualifications, identifying different language learning objectives and setting out the basis of different achievement standards. Using this framework of language competence levels, our research group, over a three year period, has developed and piloted the Academic and Professional English Language Portfolio (ACPEL) especially designed for Engineering students and professionals. This portfolio was accredited by Language division of the Council of Europe in 2008. This paper will report on an ongoing project dealing with self and peer assessment based on the ACPEL portfolio. The project's aim is threefold: first, to train university language professionals in the use of self and peer assessment through the implementation of the ACPEL portfolio; secondly, to gradually introduce these assessment processes into the engineering language curriculum and finally to monitor and evaluate these two processes at the seven engineering schools. © 2010 IEEE.","Assessment; Higher education; Second language; Self assessment","Alternative assessment; Assessment process; Bologna process; Council of Europe; Curriculum designs; Engineering institutions; Engineering schools; English languages; Higher education; Language education; Language learning; Peer assessment; Research groups; Second language; Self assessment; Technical universities; Biographies; Curricula; Engineering; Linguistics; Query languages; Engineering education","http://eesd08.tugraz.at/pics/declaration-of-barcelona-englisli.pdf; Rompelman, O., Assessment of student learning: Evolution of objectives in engineering education and the consequences for assessment (2000) Eur.

The assimilation of ubiquitous computing by education marks an important step forward, as being pervasive and persistent it allows students to access education calmly, flexibly, and seamlessly. This paper focus on a framework proposal with a well contained and defined application goal in Ubiquitous Computing and a prototype directed for Ubiquitous Learning environments. This system can augment physical objects in an educational environment with additional multimedia information, which is displayed in public shared displays according to the user (student or teacher) that faces the system. The information is contextual, based not only in the object, but also in its specific location, in the environment and in the detected user profile. A generic architecture was designed to help on the implementation of this augmented objects framework in any physical space. © 2010 IEEE.","Augmented objects; Bluetooth; Mobile devices; Public displays; Ubiquitous framework; Ubiquitous learning context","Augmented objects; Context-aware systems; Educational environment; Generic architecture; Mobile service; Multimedia information; Physical objects; Public display; Shared displays; Specific location; Ubiquitous framework; Ubiquitous learning; Ubiquitous learning environment; User profile; Bluetooth; Engineering education; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Portable equipment; Students; Teaching; Ubiquitous computing","Weiser, M., The computer for the 21st century (1991) Scientific American, 265 (3), pp. 66-75. , Sept; Price, S., Ubiquitous computing: Digital augmentation and learning (2007) M-learning: Towards A Research, Agenda, WLE Centre Occasional Papers in Work-based Learning, 1. , in Pachter, N.

The framework was developed from existing researches on engineering employability skills issues and the requirement of the accreditation of engineering programme. The various skills of employability skills related to engineering included in the framework are discussed and their criteria justified bases on literature review of existing studies. The framework sets out exactly what is meant by engineering employability, in clear and simple terms, and the framework suggests directions for interaction between the various skills. The relationships between the skills within the framework remain theoretical. Further research to test the framework is planned and will be reported in future paper. The framework can be used to explain the concept of employability to those new to the subject, and particularly to engineering students and their future employer. It will be a useful tool for lecturers, careers advisors, trainers, employers and any other practitioners involved in employability skills. It will also be used to develop a model and a measurement tool for engineering employability skills. This paper contributes insights into the linking of graduate attributes, using national accreditation criteria and the framework of engineering employability skills from locally and globally expectation. It will be of value to anybody with an interest in employability issues. © 2010 IEEE.","Employability; Employers; Engineering; Framework; Graduates","Accreditation criteria; Engineering frameworks; Engineering graduates; Literature reviews; Malaysia; Measurement tools; Accreditation; Education computing; Engineering; Engineering education","Abdullah, S., Zaharim, A., Harris, S.M., Omar, M.Z., Basti, H., Nik Mohamed, N.A., Engineering education: Using technical attributes to analyse the employers' expectation of future engineering graduates in Malaysia (2007) Proceedings of the 4th IASME/WSEAS International Conference on ENGINEERING EDUCATION (EE'07), , Mastorakis N.

Curiously, the number of students that choose technological studies and careers continues to decline. This fall is particularly noteworthy in respect of females. One of the main reasons for this is that neither the model of professional profile promoted, nor the global approach of the mission is attractive or appealing. Some studies indicate that problem-based and project-based learning methods are conducive not only to acquiring social and interpersonal skills that are valuable in a workplace, but also to increasing gender diversity in engineering degrees [9]. In this paper we present a pilot project, ICT4Girls. The main goal is to diffuse computer science as a real tool for service of society, with a principal aim of promoting ICT careers. Based on a wireless sensor network (WSN) platform, several real projects by undergraduate students are presented. For our purposes here, two projects have been defined.

The platform in question combines the educational potential of software of design and simulation of control systems - MATLAB ® - and the connection between this software and a pilot distillation column. The research hypothesis is that the use of technology platforms such as this helps to develop aspects not only stimulated with simulation. Therefore, an experiment based on the constructivist and social-interactionist theory has been designed to detect student development and to capture their impressions of the platform.

They should be capable of posing requests, formulate relevant queries, and interpret the obtained results. The user interface should allow them to concentrate on the core of the problem without disturbances caused by details of the query language's syntax. We show the results of our study of the relationship between the interface offered by query languages and their users' ability to express their requests in a correct and comfortable manner. Our aim was to analyze the state-of-art in introductory database courses from this point of view, to design and to test an educational methodology appropriate for nonprofessionals. It should help them to achieve an advanced expertise in query design and development. All DBMS's contain SQL but many of them also have a version of Query-By-Example (QBE) language. Their developers likely believe that for non-professionals this sort of interface is more appropriate for creating queries than SQL. Our review of literature showed that the topic was hardly studied in depth. To do so, we designed and developed an educational methodology which addresses the frontier field between design of query languages, HCI, users' mental and conceptual models and performed an educational experiment that tested it. Many of our presumed advantages of QBE have been proved correct. There are statistically significant differences in time, accuracy and users' satisfaction related to query creation. We also found out statistically significant differences in combinations of variables (time, accuracy, and satisfaction) and the level of task difficulty. The result may have a positive influence on nonprofessionals' exploitation of databases. It may lead to designing and developing a combined methodology that would benefit from positives of both: QBE and SQL. © 2010 IEEE.","Comparison of qbe and sql; Introductory database courses; Mental models of query processing; Query formation","Conceptual model; Database course; Database querying; Design and Development; Educational experiment; Educational methodologies; Introductory database courses; Mental model; Query formation; Query-by-example; Relevant query; Statistically significant difference; Task difficulty; Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Linguistics; Query processing; User interfaces; Query languages","Murray, N., Goble C, C., Paton, N.W., A Framework for describing visual interfaces to databases (1998) J.

The ECTS is a student-centered system based on the student workload required to achieve the objectives of a program, and the outcomes of its application have been quite positive. In order to conduct the statistical analysis of the data collected in the educational experiment and make the right decisions, at the beginning of the experiment, during the first years, both treatment and control groups were formed and several tests of hypothesis were conducted in the groups that participated in the educational experiment. Neither all the students who took the above-mentioned subjects nor all the professors who taught them participated in the experiment. However, during the last year of the experiment all the students and almost all professors participated in the experiment. Since the beginning of the experiment, satisfactory partial results have been gradually achieved, and when we managed to involve all the students and almost all professors in the last year of the experiment, the overall results where not only satisfactory but also significantly better than the ones achieved in the previous years. The students satisfaction and confidence have increased gradually, and, in general, the students under the ECTS passed more exams and with better Grades than the students under the TTLS. Also, the teaching-learning methodology strategies, tutor sessions, assessment methods, use of the virtual learning environment (VLE), student teamwork, and collaborative work among professors performed better under the ECTS than under the TTLS. © 2010 IEEE.","First-year students; Statistical analysis; Student-centered learning system","Assessment methods; Collaborative Work; Comparative analysis; Control groups; Educational experiment; First year; First year students; Previous year; Research and application; Statistical analysis; Student-centered; Student-centered learning; System-based; Teaching and learning; Teaching-learning; Virtual learning environments; Engineering education; Experiments; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Students","ECTS - European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, , http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/ects/index-en.html, European Commission; Higher Education in Europe, , http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/educ/higher/higher-en.html, European Commission; Hernandez, W., Arguelles, I., Blanco, J., Balabasquer, G., Ortiz, C., Gago, E., Educational experience of two years of the adaptation of the first-year course of the EUITT-UPM to the European Higher Education Area (2009) International Journal of Engineering Education, 25, pp. 152-160; Quakers, D.M., Sheahan, T.C., Mason, E.J., Navick, D.S., Dixon, M., Improving learning in first-year engineering courses through interdisciplinary collaborative assessment (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97, pp. 37-45; Lara, V., Professional Development Module: Student-Centered Teaching, , http://texascollaborative.org/stdtcenteredteach.htm; Mourtos, N.J., The nuts and bolts of cooperative learning in engineering (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86, pp. 35-37; Finger, S., Gelman, D., Fay, A., Szczerban, M., Assessing collaborative learning in engineering design (2006) International Journal of Engineering Education, 22, pp. 637-644; Oakley, B.A., Hanna, D.M., Kuzmyn, Z., Felder, R.M., Best practices involving teamwork in the classroom.: Results from a survey of 6435 engineering student respondents (2007) IEEE Transactions on Education, 50, pp. 266-272; Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., The role of the laboratory in undergraduate engineering education (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94, pp. 121-130; Dee, K.C., Student perceptions of high course workloads are not associated with poor student evaluations of instructor performance (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96, pp. 69-78; Greenwald, A.G., Gillmore, G.M., No pain, no gain?

To achieve this, we developed a versatile experimentation platform for the use in schools and school projects, called VenDASys (Versatile Control and Data Acquisition System). VenDASys allows the interfacing of individual (micro-)sensors or complete experimental set ups while minimizing the required electronics, which are often frustrating for students and teachers alike due to limited experience in this field. Thus, students (and teachers) can directly concentrate on and successfully deal with different sensors and experiments based on these sensors. We present the concept with an example project on blood pressure monitoring. Getting involved in comprehensible MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems)-applications and solvable problems at a relatively early stage of their education will definitely increase the chances that high school students decide to choose a technical education later on. © 2010 IEEE.","Micro-sensors; Open experimentation platform","Blood-pressure monitoring; Control and data acquisition systems; High school students; Micro electro mechanical system; Modern science; School project; Set-ups; Technical educations; Blood pressure; Engineering education; Experiments; Microsensors; Teaching; Students","Proc.

In social networking sites a user can participate intensively in activities in the service. To support collaborative study at Tampere University of Technology (TUT) and also to provide social networking tools for students especially at the beginning their studies, the development TUT's own social network site was begun in spring 2008. To make the system popular among students, developers and researchers at the Department of Mathematics and Hypermedia Laboratory at TUT designed interventions for fall 2009 when the semester began and new students started their studies. The earlier research [2] revealed numerous motivating aspects that should be somehow included in a study oriented social networking site. This paper will describe the research results of interventions to motivate students to use a social networking site in the context of studies. The results will show that such an environment with social aspects connected to studying and study life on various levels is a means of enhancing studies and basically a necessary tool, especially for students in the early phase of their studies in a new university. The motivation should be further encouraged by the system itself when it relies on students' own voluntary activity. Moreover, the intensive actions of developers, researchers and administrators can be used as tools in directing network activity development. © 2010 IEEE.","Interventions; Mathematics; Motivations; Social media; Social networking; Study support","Higher education; Hypermedia; Network activities; Research results; Social media; Social networking; Social networking sites; Social Networks; Tampere; University of Technology; Engineering education; Mathematical techniques; Motivation; Research; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Students","Boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2007) Journal of Computer-Meditated Communication, 13 (1). , http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issuel/boyd.ellison.html, article 11; Silius, K., Miilumäki, T., Huhtamäki, J., Tebest, T., Meriläinen, J., Pohjolainen, S., Students motivations for social media enhanced studying and learning (2010) Knowledge Management & E-Learning: An International Journal, K.M&EL, , in press; Kärkkäinen, J., (2007) Raportti Uudessa Tutkintorakenteessa Opiskelevien Ensimmäisen Ja Toisen Vuoden Opiskelijoiden Opintojen Etenemisestä Tampereen Teknillisessä Yliopistossa, , Tampere: Tampereen teknillinen yliopisto, Opiskelijapaivelut; Pohjolainen, S., Silius, K., Huikkola, M., Raassina, H., Clustering of students of engineering mathematics based on their attitudes, orientations, motivations and intentions (2007) Proceedings of the 4th WSEAS, ISME International Conference on Engineering Education, EE'07, , N.

But these conventional E-learning platforms aim at students who are used to work on their own. Our students are young (19 years old - 22 years old), and in their first year at the university. Following extensive interviews with our students, we have designed GE3D, an E-learning platform, according to their expectations and our criteria. In this paper, we describe the students' demands, resulting from the interviews. Then, we present our virtual campus. Even if our platform uses some elements coming from the 3D games world, it is always a pedagogical tool. Using this technology, we developed a 3D representation of the real world. We also propose a process of a lecture on the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC's) in this new universe. GE3D is a multi-users tool, with a synchronous technology, an intuitive interface for end-users and an embedded Intelligent Tutoring System to support learners. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; Engineering education; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning systems platforms; Multi agent system; Technology-Enhanced learning; Virtual campus","Component engineering; E-learning platforms; End-users; First year; Intelligent tutoring system; Intuitive interfaces; Learning management system; Multiusers; Pedagogical tools; Synchronous technology; Technology enhanced learning; Virtual campus; Computer aided instruction; Controllers; E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Programmable logic controllers; Students; Technology; Three dimensional; Engineering education","http://moodle.org/sites, 41 415 currently active sites among 210 countries including 10.318 in U.S., 3.480 in U.K and 710 in France Retrieved October 30th, 2009; Scheucher, T., Bailey, P.H., Gûtl, C., Harward, V.J., Collaborative virtual 3D environment for internet-accessible physics experiments (2009) International Journal of Online Engineering, 5 (1), pp. 65-71. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v5s1.1014, Retrieved October 5th, 2009; Lee, M.J.W., How can 3D virtual worlds be used to support collaborative learning?

With the growing interdependence between technology, industry, economy and society, more opportunities will be available for engineers to exercise their potential as leaders, not only in business but also in the nonprofit and government sectors. In this paper, the following questions are addressed: What does it mean for engineers to have business and management competency? How can engineering schools prepare their students to attain the type of business and management competency demanded by industry? The analysis presented in this paper addresses the above questions in the following ways. First it defines the meaning of business and management competency for engineers. Second, it offers a minimum learning criterion for the business and management competency of engineers and a set of three learning outcomes of engineering management education. Third, this paper shows the results of an industry demand survey for engineering management education as well as provides a review of the global educational trends in this field in the U.S., Japan and Korea.

A great challenge is presented to Superior Education Institutions: to establish the link between traditional cycles: technical, technology and professional ones with the secondary, basic and media levels. Our solution is presented linking each phase with a propedaeutic component discussed in a model. The model is dialogically integrated by cognitive an informational components. A structural system to determine and analyze the cohesion and coherence of the propedaeutic cycles between competences and the curriculum knowledge. This construct enables curricular knowledge management inside the media and higher education. Several types of matrices are developed; firstly regarding columns: the longitudinal one in time (semesters); secondly the cross one grouped by curriculum subjects, (additionally each cell of them can be expressed by fuzzy values); thirdly regarding the structure: the input/output for optimization purposes. An individualized model of student productivity to be integrated to counteract the stereotypes which considers the technical and technological cycles as relegated careers in higher education. This model is an intelligent knowledge based one which was validated with a software prototype just implemented in the FESSJ. This construct has as its mission the guarantee of quality assurance of student's propaedeutic cycles. A multidimensional flexibility system supported on university autonomy for managing student, pedagogical, and curricular knowledge which enables the management of the heterogeneous and complex environment; this subsystem is intended to ensure continuity and permanence of the student. The earlier is framed within a construct of curriculum knowledge and information. From this it is intended to reduce the high complexity of the harmonization and articulation of the propaedeutic cycles which face the universities when undertaking these projects. Moreover, it is pursued to offer major clarity to the educational community and in this way to contribute to the democratization of the involved knowledge within this methodological strategic articulating efforts according to the policy of the Colombian Government which seeks not only to increase the educational population but also to a major access of the marginalized social population and of those of lower revenues in order to fulfill the right to information executed by the National Constitution of this country © 2010 IEEE.","Expertise; ICT; Intelligent knowledge based system; Knowledge management; Matrix of curricular coherence; Media and higher education; Model; Propaedeutic cycles; Student's model","Expertise; Higher education; ICT; matrix; Matrix of curricular coherence; Media and higher education; Curricula; Engineering education; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Mathematical models; Model structures; Quality assurance; Software prototyping; Students; Teaching; Total quality management; Education computing","Pérez-Gama, A., Hoyos-Gomez, G., Mena, A., Systems engineering curricula design based on architectures under Colombia propaedeutical cycles2 IEEE CERMA 2009 Workshop on Innovation, , ISBN 978-07695-3799-8 MEXICO; Pérez-Gama, A., (2008) Planeación Estratégica de Sistemas de Información y de Conocimientos, Continuidad, Arquitecturas y Gobernabilidad Courseware, , XII Edición ACCIO Asociación Colombiana de Informática; Pérez-Gama, A., (2009) Arquitecturas de Datos, Información, Conocimiento, Tics y de Sistemas de Información Gerencial Courseware, , Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas - I Edición 2009; FESSJ y ACCIO Asociación Colombiana de Informática; Ortegón, E., Pérez-Gama, A., Ballera, G., Aplicaciones de la Programación Lineal en la Planeación del Sector Salud (1973) Revista de Planeación y Desarrollo, 5 (3). , ISSN 0034-8686 (Depto Nacional de Planeación) Septembe; Pérez-Gama, A., Uso de Modelos Multisectoriales de Programación Lineal en Ciencias Sociales (1978) Journal TEMAS ADMINISTRATIVOS, , U.

Automation is partly to be blamed for this problem. In fact, the existence of the ""auto scale"" button has eliminated the hassle of making adjustments, but at the price of dampening the students' curiosity and removing their need for deep understanding. We have found a powerful way of stimulating students' curiosity and of bestowing them with knowledge of the basic oscilloscope operation: While still using an oscilloscope-set, although merely as a display unit, we have by-passed its fundamental components (namely the vertical amplifier, the time base and the trigger circuit), with our own designed components, built outside of the oscilloscope-set. Our teaching strategy provides students with hands-on experimentation of the circuits that control vertical gain, the time scale and the trigger level. Our educational tool is implemented in hardware; it is not another simulation oscilloscope. The effects of our didactic tool are highly positive, as demonstrated by student evaluation of circuit laboratories that took place before and after we incorporated the Educational Oscilloscope into the engineering curriculum.

Assessment for this effort focuses on measuring students' development of both the technical and transferable skills associated with the practice of being a software engineer. However, it is often difficult for the student to perceive and articulate what skills they have learned during the project based on marks and feedback from lots of separate elements of coursework. In this paper, we propose that assessment of Software Engineering team projects should focus on the development of a range of competencies that could be measured in a style that relates directly to professional performance appraisal. We describe the current assessment methods we use and then outline a set of alternative competencies and appraisal methods that could be used to help staff and students better evaluate levels of achievement and skill development in qualitative terms during undergraduate team projects in Software Engineering. © 2010 IEEE.","Competency; Skill development; Software engineeering","Active Learning; Appraisal method; Assessment methods; Collaborative learning model; Computing science; Durham University; Global industry; Level 2; Performance appraisal; Project-based; Separate element; Skill development; Software development; Software engineers; Team projects; Transferable skills; Undergraduate software engineering; Biographies; Computer software; Education computing; Engineering; Engineering education; Students; Software design","http://www.hefce.ac.uk/learning/tinits/cetiy, HEFCE CETL Initiative: Accessed 10/11/09; McNamara, R.A., Evaluating assessment with competency mapping (2004) Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Australasian Computing Education, 30, pp. 193-199. , R.

An online laboratory generally will consist of several hardware-based remote experiments. However, one particular experiment can be performed at a time by an individual student or a group of students which require a careful scheduling of the experiments. For the proper implementation of an online laboratory an efficient laboratory management system (LMS) is thus essential. Also for an online laboratory, the students need to fully understand the experimental system setup and feel comfortable as in an actual laboratory environment which, however, can be effectively done by adding suitable videos and animations etc. Besides, the students should be able to run the remote experiments, extract, save and analyze the data and submit laboratory reports online. The front end of the laboratory management system should be made browser-based so that one can use the laboratory facility from anywhere. Also, for the teachers, the laboratory management system should include an online evaluation for the quiz/viva-voce, checking experimental data, grading of submitted laboratory reports and feedback for the students. In this paper, we describe the design and prototype implementation of an online laboratory management system (for use with shared hardware-based remote laboratory resources) which may be employed for running internet-based online laboratory courses for geographically dispersed Institutions. © 2010 IEEE.","E-learning; Online experimentation; Online laboratory; Remote control","Distance-learning; Educational laboratory; Experimental data; Experimental system; Front end; Internet based; Laboratory environment; Laboratory facilities; Laboratory management; On-line evaluation; Online experimentation; Online hardware; Online laboratory; Prototype implementations; Remote experiments; Remote laboratories; Curricula; E-learning; Engineering education; Experiments; Management; Remote control; Software prototyping; Students; Laboratories","Li, Y., Esche, S.K., Chassapis, C., A scheduling system for shared online laboratory resources (2008) 38th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 22-25. , October New York, NY, T2B-1; Saliah, H.H., Villardier, L., Assogba, B., Kedowide, C., Wong, T., Resource management strategies for remote virtual laboratory experimentation (2000) Frontier in Education Conference: Building A Century of Progress in Engineering Education, , Kansas City, USA, October 18-21, 2000; Gilibert, M., Picazo, J., Auer, M.E., Pester, A., Cusido, J., Ortega, J.A., Microcontroller remote lab for E-learning teaching (2006) IJOE, 2 (4). , Special Issue 20 years of LabVIEW; Ursutiu, D., Iordache, D., Cotfas, P.A., Cotfas, D.T., Samoila, C., New technology used in remote laboratories (2008) Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation REV2008, , Dusseldorf -Germany, June 2325, ISBN 978-3-89958-352-6; Yan, Y., Liang, Y., Du, X., Controlling remote instruments using web services for online experiment systems (2005) 3rd Intl.

The yPBL methodology is defined as a mapping between the roles and phases considered in PBL methodologies to the roles, iterations and phases considered in the ""y"" methodology. Moreover, the yPBL method includes different situations of active and passive learning roles not only for the students involved in a course but also for the instructors. Indeed, software engineering instructors face the same challenge of any software engineer and needs to continuously update their knowledge in software technologies. The yPBL method has been designed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the various interactions points between the various process actors as well as the information to be exchanged during the synchronous and asynchronous learning process have been specified using this language. Finally, interesting preliminary results of the experience of using this methodology in the INSA of Toulouse are included in this paper. © 2010 IEEE.","Problem based learning; Software development process; Software engineering process; Unified modeling language","Asynchronous learning; Passive learning; Problem based learning; Software engineering process; Software engineers; Software technology; Toulouse; Computer software; Engineering; Knowledge engineering; Linguistics; Software design; Teaching; Unified Modeling Language; Engineering education","Savery, J.R., Overview of problem-based learning: Definitions and distinctions (2006) Interdisciplinary Journal of Problembased Learning, 1 (1). , Article 3; Biggs, J., (2003) Teaching for Quality Learning at University Buckingham, , The Society for Research into Higher Education and Open University Press, ISBN 0-335-21168-2; Jacobson, I., Booch, G., Rumbaugh, J., (1999) The Unified Software Development Process (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series), , Addison-Wesley Professional; (2000) UML en Action, , Pascal Roques et Franck Vallée, Editorial Eyrolles, february ISBN-10: 2212091273; PMP: Software Project Management Plan (PMP) IEEE 1058; SRS: Software Requirements Specification IEEE 830; SDD: Software Design Description IEEE 1016; SQAP: Software Quality Assurance Plan IEEE 730; SCMP: Software Configuration Management Plan IEEE 828; STD: Software Test Documentation IEEE 829; SVVP: Software Validation & Verification Plan IEEE 1012; Moodle Learning Management System, , http://moodle.org/","Exposito, E.; CNRS, 7 av. du Colonel Roche, F-31077 Toulouse, France; email: ernesto.exposito@insa-toulouse.fr",,9781424465682,,"English","IEEE Educ.

Ingeniería Electrónica, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain","This gesture recognizer, developed by students in a third-year microprocessor-based laboratory course, takes Wii remote (Wiimote) as an input device to estimate the movements of the user and to compare the detected trajectory with the previously learnt movements, in order to carry out the associated actions. Such a cheap state-of-the-art wireless user interface is very attractive for the students and can be used in many interactive applications, from robotics to virtual reality and multimedia presentations. By combining commercially-available hardware, pattern-matching techniques and programming skills, we are able to foster students' interest on developing innovative potentially-marketable systems. This freeware project, implemented as a configurable publicly-available library, can be adapted to the needs of any course or student. In our laboratory this open-source DLL is used for remotely controlling a robot (based on an open-hardware Arduino platform), using a PC and the Wiimote, although the DLL can be integrated in any C, C++, Java or C# project. A GUI application (based on a Model-View-Presenter paradigm) is also provided and can be used as a template for new applications or just for debugging purposes. Although the developed application only uses data from the accelerometers, data from the infrared camera and buttons of the Wiimote is also available. © 2010 IEEE.","Arduino; Microprocessor; Microprocessor programming; Open source library; Project based learning; Wiimote","Configurable; Developed applications; GUI applications; Infra-red cameras; Input devices; Interactive applications; Laboratory course; Multimedia presentation; New applications; Open-source; Open-source libraries; Pattern-matching technique; Programming skills; Project based learning; Remotely controlling; Wii remote; Wireless users; Education computing; Engineering education; Microprocessor chips; Teaching; Virtual reality; Students","Buck Institute of education (2007) Project Based Learning Handbook, pp. 3-10; Barrows, H.S., Problem-based learning in medicine and beyond: A brief overview (1996) Bringing Problem-based Learning to Higher Education: Theory and Practice, pp. 3-12. , San Francisco: Josey-Bass; Solomon, G., Project-Based learning: A Primer (2003) Technology and Learning, 23, pp. 20-27; Albanese, M.A., Mitchell, S., Problem-based learning: A review of literature on its outcomes and implementation issues (1993) Academic Medicine, 68, pp. 52-81; Robert, S., Weaver, D.K., Mark, S., Edward, J., (2007) Integrating A Project Based Learning Model into the Entrepreneurial University, , NJ: Rowan University; Macías-Guarasa, J., Montero, J.M., San-Segundo, R., Araujo, A., Nieto-Taladriz, O., A Project-Based Learning Approach to Design an Electronic Systems Curricula (2006) IEEE Transactions on Education, 49, pp. 389-397; Ambrose, S.A., Amon, C.H., Systematic design of a first-year mechanical engineering course at Carnegie-Mellon University (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86, pp. 173-182; Ryser, G.R., Beeler, J.E., McKenzie, C.M., Effects of a Computer-Supported International Learning Environment (CSILE) on students' self-concept, self-regulatory behavior, and critical thinking ability (1995) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 13, pp. 375-385; Pellegrino, J.W., Hickey, D., Heath, A., Rewey, K., Vye, N.J., (1992) Assessing the Outcomes of An Innovative Instructional Program: The 1990-1991 Implementation of the Adventures of Jasper Woodbury, , Nashville, TN: Vaderbilt University, Learning Technology Center; http://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/vcsharp/default.aspx; Sharp, J., (2005), Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Step by Step, Microsoft Press; NET Managed Library for the Nintendo Wii Remote, , http://www.codeplex.com/WiimoteLib; http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/GraphPlotting.aspx; http://msdn.microsoft.com/engb/library/default.aspx; http://www.mono-project.com/Main-Page; http://www.arduino.cc/","Lorente-Leal, A.; Dept.

Academics and practitioners, who teach topics related to technology innovation to multidisciplinary classes, usually they do so deductively, that is the lecturer introduces the general principles and continues with applications of those principles. A common observation is that University students do not see any motivation knowing that someday they will need those knowledge and skills. A Student-centered teaching method on the other hand shifts the focus of activity from the lecturer to student including inductive teaching and learning. The new, elective ""MGT370- Management of Innovation and Technology"" course was to engage students from different specializations in a collaborative environment in which students have access to assignments based on real-world case studies and problems. After a group open-discussion a preliminary analysis of students' perceptions towards technology innovation content knowledge faced a significant contradiction. This paper presents a review of the unique features of the main inductive methods, describes the new elective Management of Innovation and Technology course, presents assessment outcomes, reports the learning outcomes after the employment of inductive learning strategies in the course and gives recommendations on how assessments are being used to deploy, manage and improve the course. © 2010 IEEE.","Inductive teaching and learning method; Problem based learning; Student-centered method; Technology innovations","Collaborative environments; Content knowledge; Inductive learning strategies; Inductive method; Learning outcome; Management of innovation; Management of innovation and technology; Preliminary analysis; Problem based learning; Real-world; Student-centered; Student-centered teaching; Teaching and learning; Technological innovation; Technology innovation; Unique features; University students; Engineering education; Engineering research; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Management information systems; Students; Teaching; Technology transfer; Innovation","Prince, M., Felder, R., Inductive teaching and learning methods: Definitions, comparisons and research bases (2006) Journal of Education, 95 (2), pp. 123-138; Kardash, C., Wallace, M., The perceptions of science classes survey: What undergraduate science reform efforts really need to address (2001) Journal of Educational Psychology, 93 (1), pp. 199-210; Seymour, E., Hewitt, N., (1997) Talking about Leaving: Why Undergraduates Leave Science, , Boulder, CO: Westview; Ramsden, P., (2003) Learning to Teachin Higher Education, , 2nd ed.

This paper argues that in order to built such an awareness, engineering students should acquire direct, first-hand experiences of real people in real contexts. It presents a number of techniques that can be used to gain such experiences. Each technique is briefly described and illustrated with examples from our Industrial Design Engineering program. Knowledge, skills and attitude that are acquired through the use of the techniques are listed and reflected upon. Finally, our experiences with implementing the techniques into our program are discussed in view of their relevance for other engineering programs. © 2010 IEEE.","Generative techniques; Industrial design; User centered design","Engineering program; Global context; Industrial design; New opportunities; User centered designs; Engineering; Industry; Personnel training; Product design; Students; Engineering education","Beder, S., (1998) The New Engineer, , Sidney: Macmillan; Conlon, E., The new engineer: Between employability and social responsibility (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (2), pp. 151-159. , May; Rugarcia, A., Felder, R.M., Stice, J.E., Woods, D.R., The future of engineering education: I.

International distance education has also been conducted since 2002. Backed up with those experiences, in 2007 we started a new graduate program allied with National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) and Thai universities. The program is called Thailand Advance Institute of Science and Technology (TAIST) - Tokyo Tech. TAIST will serve as a virtual institution and focal point. NSTDA provides researchers to act as adjunct professors, research projects and scholarships for graduate students. Thai universities provide an academic framework, academic staff to oversee and guide students and degrees for the successful candidates. Currently two master programs are running; Automotive Engineering (AE) and Information and Communication Technology for Embedded Systems (ICTES). Tokyo Tech is responsible for most of its coursework. To get rid of long travel between Tokyo and Bangkok (separated by 4,600km), distance education is effectively utilized. In the ICTES program, 7 lecture courses out of 18 are entirely taught from Tokyo, and some others combine distance education. AU the course materials are uploaded on the e-learning site, where lecture videos are also available for some courses. TAIST-Tokyo Tech is expected to initiate the start of a positive spiral of human resource development system in Asian region. TAIST-Tokyo Tech aims to harmonize advanced technology with the environment and to realize research and human resource development for global sustainable development.

A Wi-Fi tag has been built by Tag4M of Austin, TX, USA, with the purpose of connecting sensors to the Internet where data is displayed using Web Pages that are posted and can be accessed from anywhere in the world. The Tag4M Wi-Fi tag is tiny and low cost works on battery power, and therefore it is very suitable for student experimentation as an extension of the remote laboratory framework. The tag allows remote students logged in the iLab framework to execute local or home based experiments, and by that brings more hands on capability to the framework. The paper introduces the Tag4M tag, the iLab framework, gives an example of using the iLab framework with the NI ELVIS station, and shows how this type of experimentation can be enriched using the tag to introduce local experimentation where remote students can perform hands-on sensor measurements, create their own web page instruments and also post their web page instruments into the general framework for other remote students to use. © 2010 IEEE.","ILab; Web page instrument; Wi-Fi tag","Battery power; ILab; Low costs; Remote laboratories; Remote students; Sensor measurements; Student experimentation; Web page; Web page instrument; Engineering education; Experiments; Instruments; Laboratories; Sensors; Wi-Fi; World Wide Web; Students","www.tag4m.com; Ghercioiu, M., Folea, S., Ultra-low power Wi-Fi tag for wireless sensing (2008) IEEE International Conference, , Cluj-Napoca, Romania May 22-25; Cotfas, D.T., Cotfas, P.A., Ursutiu, D., Kaplanis, S., Samoila, C., Virtual Instrumentation in the solar cell characterization (2007) International Symposium on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation REV2007, , Porto, 25-27 June, Kassel Press; Ursutiu, D., Cotfas, P., Samoila, C., Creativity in remote laboratory and virtual instrumentation (2008) International Conference on Technology, , Communication and Education (i-TCE), April 7-9, Kuwait; Ursutiu, D., Ghercioiu, M., Samoila, C., WiFi sensor for greenhouse monitoring (2008) Int.Conference Bioatlas, , 4-7 June, Brasov, Romania; Ursutiu, D., Cotfas, P., Samoila, C., (2009) Online Engineering in University Environment, pp. 122-160. , Online Engineering N.

The suitable use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can make a contribution to improving the quality of teaching and learning. In this context, a self-evaluation platform is developed using the technology of Intelligent Agents. This system can be adaptable as it adjusts the various selfevaluation tests to the student's level of knowledge.

Certifications act as a signal to hiring managers that a job candidate has achieved a level of knowledge and skill necessary to perform in a particular job role. In the IT (Information Technologies) sector, a recent study sought to determine if human resource managers (HR) and IT professionals perceived certifications differently in the context of the hiring process [7]. The purpose of this exploratory case study was to determine how IT professionals perceive certification programs as a professional training alternative, when compared with more traditional education settings, and the kind of effect the effective participation in one of the programs has in that judgment. The data for this exploratory study was gathered from a 58 employee sample of a Portuguese-based multinational software engineering company. An experimental Competence Certification Effects Scale (CCES) was used, and after a consistency analysis, the original 22 items were reduced to 17, grouped in a 4-factor structure: ""Intrinsic Value""; ""Certification as Training""; ""Career Management""; and ""Effort Trade-off"". Cronbach's alphas were .81, .81, .83, and .81, respectively. In short, the findings of the study indicate that there is a significant difference in the perceived usefulness of a certification, if an employee participates or not in a dedicated certification program. This difference is more significant in more senior, management-related roles, as for junior engineers that don't participate in a certification program, this participation isn't seen as a professional development anchor or a valid education driver.

This is especially true when students perform laboratory activities where they interact with equipment and objects under experimentation. In this context, technology can also play a facilitator role if it allows students to perform experiments in a remote fashion, through the Internet, in a so-called weblab or remote laboratory. No doubt, the Internet has been revolutionizing the educational process in many aspects, and it can be stated that remote laboratories are just an angle ofthat on-going revolution. As any other educational tool or resource, the i) pedagogical approach and the ii) technology used in the development of a remote laboratory can dictate its general success or its ephemeral existence. By pedagogical approach we consider the way remote experiments address the process by which students acquire experimental skills and link experimental results to theoretical concepts. In respect to technology, we discuss different specification and implementation alternatives, to show the case where the adoption of a family of standards would positively contribute to a larger acceptance and utilization of remote laboratories, and also to a wider collaboration in their development. © 2010 IEEE.","E-learning; Ieee 1451.0 std; Reconfigurable weblabs; Remote experimentation; Remote laboratories","Educational process; Educational tools; Engineering course; IEEE-1451; Pedagogical approach; Re-configurable; Remote experimentation; Remote experiments; Remote laboratories; Teaching/learning; E-learning; Engineering education; Internet; Laboratories; Standardization; Students; Teaching; Technology; Experiments","Maslow, A.H., A theory of human motivation (1943) Classics in Management Thought, 1 (25), p. 450. , Edward Elgar Publishing; Herzberg, F., Work, and the nature of man (1966) The World Publishing Company, , Cleveland, OH; Vygotsky, L.S., Mind in society: Development of higher psychological processes (1978) Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data; Wenger, E., Communities of practice-learning, meaning and identity (1998) Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Siemens, G., Tittenberger, P., (2009) Handbook, of Emerging Technologies for Learning, , http://www.umanitoba.ca/learning_technologies/cetl/HETL.pdf; Siemens, G., (2005) Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age, , http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm; Festinger, L., Carlsmith, J.M., Cognitive consequences of forced compliance (1959) Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 58; Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., The role of the laboratory in undergraduate engineering education (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94, pp. 121-130. , Jan; Kolb, D.A., (1984) Experiential Learning: Experience As the Source of Learning and Development, , Prentice Hall, Inc; Soysal, O.A., Computer integrated experimentation in electrical engineering education over distance (2000) ASEE 2000 Annual Conference, Saint Louis, MO, , Jun; Ma, J., Nickerson, J.V., Hands-on, simulated, and remote laboratories: A comparative literature review (2006) ACM Computing Surveys, 38, p. 7; Scheucher, B., Collaborative virtual 3D environment for internet- Accessible physics experiments (2009) International Journal of Online Engineering (IJOE), 5; Müller, D., Mixed reality learning spaces for collaborative experimentation: A challenge for engineering education and training (2007) International Journal of Online Engineering (IJOE), 3; Ferreira, J., Collaborative learning in a web-accessible workbench (2002) Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Groupware (CRIWG'02), la Serena (Chile), , Sep; Hine, H., Institutional factors governing the deployment of remote experiments: Lessons from the REXNET project (2007) International Conference on Remote Engineering & Virtual Instrumentation (REV'07), , Porto; Gravier, C., State of the art about remote laboratories paradigms - Foundations of ongoing mutations (2008) International Journal of Online Engineering (IJOE), 4; Means, B., (2009) Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies, , EDUCASE; (2009) ILabs: Internet Access to Real Labs, , http://icampus.mit.edu/iLabs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; (2009), https://www.weblab.deusto.es, University of Deusto; (2009), http://elabs.fe.up.pt, Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto; Mergl, C., Comparison of remote labs in different technologies (2006) International Journal of Online Engineering (IJOE), 2; Zubia, J.G., Towards a canonical software architecture for multidevice WebLabs (2005) Industrial Electronics Society IECON 2005. 31st Annual Conference of IEEE; Costa, R., FPGA-based weblab infrastructures - Guidelines and a prototype implementation example 3rd IEEE International Conference on E-Learning in Industrial Electronics (ICELIE'2009), 2009. , 3th to 7th Nov., Porto-Portugal, 2009; IEEE 1451.0 Std. - Standard for a smart transducer interface for sensors and actuators - Common functions, communication protocols, and transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS) formats (2007) The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, , Inc; Li, Y., A scheduling system for shared online laboratory resources (2008) 38th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference; Fujii, N., Work in progress -a dual mode remote laboratory system supporting both real-time and batch controls by making use of virtual machines (2008) 38th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference; Gericota, M., Run-time management of logic resources on reconfigurable systems (2003) Proceedings of the Design, Automation and Test in Europe 2003 Conference and Exhibition (DATE'2003)","Costa, R.; ISEP, United States; email: rjc@isep.ipp.pt",,9781424465682,,"English","IEEE Educ.

In this paper, the processes involved in assessment in engineering university learning are identified, described, reviewed and analyzed in order to ensure fast feedback to the students. A method for evaluation called extreme Learning is introduced which builds upon highly granular and continuous evaluation, integration of evaluation within the general learning process and fast feedback of evaluation results to students. At the same time, the method keeps some principles of traditional learning considered mandatory for its application in university education, as they certify the level of knowledge of the student. © 2010 IEEE.","Assisted assessment; Computer; E-Assessment; Educational methods","Assisted assessment; Engineering universities; Evaluation and assessment; Evaluation results; General learning; Learning methods; Learning process; Traditional learning; University education; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Gipps, C.V., Beyond testing (1994) Towards A Theory of Educational Assessment, , Oxon, UK, Ed.

We propose an integrated student-centered collaborative learning environment for developing communication skills, using project-based learning methods and peer assessment. In our learning environment, projects are assigned to small groups of students under teacher supervision, documented in a wiki-editing tool and presented during a public poster session. By combining wiki entries and poster presentations, we intend to facilitate students (1) to gain access to the project of their peers and share their results, (2) to analyze and comment critically the project of their peers and provide them with feedback, and (3) to enhance their writing and oral skills. Previous experiences encourage us to promote this integrated learning environment. Wiki environments allowed students to improve the quality of their projects and to develop a critical attitude towards their projects and the projects of their peers. The poster session was found to be more dynamic than traditional oral presentations. Students got engaged in a more open and critical manner with the project of their peers, and students presenting their project had the chance to improve the quality of their presentation on the fly, by presenting their work several times in the duration of the session. In future courses, we will implement a learning environment that combines both wikibased and poster session approaches. We expect that the implementation of both approaches will help to develop the communication skills of engineering students. © 2010 IEEE.","Collaborative learning; Communication skills; Poster session; Project based learning; Wiki","Collaborative learning; Collaborative learning environment; Communication skills; Editing tools; Integrated learning; Learning environments; On the flies; Oral presentations; Peer assessment; Poster presentations; Poster sessions; Project based learning; Project-based learning methods; Small groups; Student-centered; Communication; Engineering; Interoperability; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Light, G., Cox, R., (2001) Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, , Sage Pbulications; www.wikipedia.org; Franklin, T., Van Harmelen, M., (2007) Web 2.0 for Content for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, , JISC report, Bristol; Guth, S., Wikis in education: Is public better?

However, these technologies present three main drawbacks: (1) a high cost in terms of hardware and infrastructure, (2) a high level of technology knowledge, and usually programming skills, is required to build up an educational and functional platform, and (3) once the educational platform is available for use, the educators are limited to the functionalities provided by the platform used. Our previous experience, designing and deploying a VR educational platform, named V-LeaF, showed that non immersive platforms (close to the gaming 3D platforms) provide High School educators and students with an attractive environment in which many features of the teaching/learning experience can be explored. However, this technological strength appears as a potential weakness feature of our platform when is used by high school students. Serious problems to maintain the student attention in this kind of domains have been detected, so the educators must employ time and dedication to ensure that students are really attending and acquiring the educational concepts scheduled.

These systems typically provide a centralized environment where students can communicate, carry out experiments, etc. However, the rapid growth of these platforms together with the unlimited need for learning tools, mainly in engineering education contexts (e.g. simulators, communication tools), are hindering their development. The natural alternative is to decouple these tools from the Learning Management Systems themselves, taking advantage of the Software as a Service distribution model. To perform such a decoupling a middleware is required to allow the integration and use of an external tool by the Learning Management System. In this paper a proposal for such middleware is described, with a special focus on the part devoted to manage instances and the transfer of data. © 2010 IEEE.","Data-transfer interface; Hard integration; Instance Interface; Learning Management Systems; Middleware; Software as a Service","Data-transfer interface; Instance Interface; Learning management system; Software as a service; Transfer interface; Data transfer; Education computing; Fuzzy control; Internet; Management; Middleware; Photovoltaic effects; Teaching; Web services; Engineering education","Web Site of the Moodle Project, , http://moodle.org/, Last accessed on November, 2009; Web Site of the Blackboard Project, , http://www.blackboard.com/us/index.bbb, Last accessed on November, 2009; LRN Web Site, , http://dotlrn.org/, Last accessed on November, 2009; Moodle Modules and Extensions, , http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?id=6009, Last accessed on November, 2009; Kyng, M., (1997) Computers and Design in Context, , The MIT Press; Caeiro, M., PoEML: A separation-of-concerns proposal to instructional design (2007) Handbook of Visual Languages for Instructional Design: Theory and Practice, , edited by L.

The laboratory applications are usually very limited for hands on experience since the high cost and maintenance requirements of the equipment. Additionally, new engineers need to know how to use at least one engineering design tool in order to practice designing RF components, circuits, or antennas. In this study, a curriculum model including recent developments and technologies in the RF and Microwave Engineering field by addressing above problems of the course is proposed. This study covers the description of the content of theoretical and hands on applications, the integration model of the technological tools into the proposed curriculum, and the instructional approaches used in the new course design which covers the use of a remote laboratory environment, Concept Maps and an engineering design tool. The course is structured with a balance between theory and laboratory, including remote and in lab measurement experiments as well as modeling and designing microwave components by means of computer tools and design fabrication.

In the College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), embedded system education is one of the characteristic subjects, so ""practical training"" is the brand new characters as the most important process in the embedded system education towards industrygeared training. The training is an on-campus process toward gaining the practical experiences which are suitable for the real engineering design or IT related companies, especially so for the students without past work experiences. Practical training using single industrial grade kits on embedded system has expanded to most Electrical and Electronic Engineering for both undergraduate and graduate students. The course has been updated towards industry employees training especially to meet their design aspects. Embedded systems course have been deployed in numerous fields which have different requirements of embedded systems architecture. In this paper, a project-based learning strategy using single training kit is proposed as a pedagogical tool for embedded system education. The proposed project-based learning can motivate students to integrate and formulate the multi-disciplinary knowledge previous learned into a real-world embedded system project development. The course development focused on lecture-lab integration and laboratory learning.

The objective of this change in the traditional methodology of the Power Electronics course is to foster the application of the knowledge acquired by students in theory classes. PBL is known to be a motivating, problem-centered teaching method that brings the real professional world closer to the student. For this reason, the lecturers considered PBL to be the most suitable methodology to obtain the desired results.

However, there are not many studies addressing the requirements and design issues of such laboratories. This paper discusses the results of a study of the requirements for developing a remote Radio Frequency (RF) laboratory for university students. This study draws on the perspectives of the students at the university, department of electrical engineering. The results are based on a research study established by 111 engineering students from France, Germany, Romania and Turkey. It investigates how students would like to use the technical content of a state of the art RF laboratory. The result of this study is also compared with the previous outcomes showing perspectives of the other learner groups of such laboratories; engineers and technicians in the technical colleges on the Radio Frequency (RF) domain. Considering the outcomes developed so far, some principles that need to be considered while designing and developing such a laboratory have been proposed. As a case study the proposed principles are implemented in a remote laboratory project. In this paper, the details of user requirements of such laboratories, the proposed principles and the implementation examples are all provided and discussed. Primarily, the general aim of this study is to guide remote laboratory platform developers towards the most effective design of their platforms. © 2010 IEEE.","Distance education; Engineering education; Higher education; Improving classroom teaching; Lifelong learning; Remote laboratory","Higher education; Improving classroom teaching; Life long learning; Remote laboratories; Remote laboratory; Design; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Laboratories; Radio; Radio waves; Research; School buildings; Students; Teaching; Distance education","Cagiltay, N.E., Aydin, E.U., Kara, A., Remote RF Laboratory Requirements: Engineers' and technicians' Perspective (2007) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 8 (4), pp. 80-95; Cagiltay, N.E., Aydin, E., Oktem, R., Kara, A., Alexandra, M., Reiner, B., Requirements for RF Laboratory applications: An educators' perspective (2009) IEEE Transactions on Education, 52 (1); Koohang, A., Durante, A., Learners' perceptions toward the webbased distance learning activities/assignments portion of an undergraduate hybrid instructional model (2003) Journal of Information Technology Education, 2, pp. 105-113; Hooijdonk, C.V., Krahmer, E., Information Modalities for Procedural Instructions: The influence of Text, Pictures, and Film Clips on Learning and Executing RSI Exercises (2008) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 51 (1), pp. 50-62; Mayer Richard, E., The promise of multimedia learning: Using the same instructional, design methods across different media (2003) Learning and Instruction, 13, pp. 125-139; Bele, J.L., Rugelj, J., Efficient Learning from multimedia web-based learning contents, Current developments in Technology Assisted Education (2006) Forth International Conference on Multimedia and Information and Communication Technologies in Education, 20-25, pp. 396-400; Michas, I.C., Dianne, C.B., Learning and procedural task: Effectiveness of multimedia presentations (2000) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 14, pp. 555-575; Cagiltay, N.E., Yildirim, S., Aksu, M., Students' preferences on webbased instruction: Linear or non-linear (2006) Journal of Educational Technology and Society, 9 (3), pp. 122-136; Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council Report, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:111:0001: 0007:EN:PDF, European Council, Accessed at May, 2008 from; Cassara, F., Wireless communication laboratory (2006) IEEE Trans.

Altogether, these changes condition the design and implementation of a subject on Computer Networks. Considering the presented changes we sketch the design of an introductory subject on Computer Networking. The subject is part of a pre-Bologna course, but is designed with the transition on mind. On the paper, we sketch the implementation of the course, designed to simplify the transition to conform the recommendations of the European Higher Education Area. We detail what contents were part of the theoretical or lab sessions, and how we managed to make most lab sessions with mid-class real hardware, introducing relatively complex concepts such as Quality of Service. © 2010 IEEE.","Bologna process; Computer networks; Course design; Lab exercises; Revolution","Bologna process; Computer networking; Course design; Economic aspects; European Higher Education Area; Design; Engineering education; Internet; Laboratories; Quality of service; Curricula","De las señales de humo a la sociedad del conocimiento. 1.50 años de las Telecomunicaciones en España (2006) Colegio Oficial de Ingenieros de Telecomunicación, , Foro Histórico de las Telecomunicaciones; Nota Mensual de Agosto de 2009, , http://www.cmt.es/es/publicaciones/anexos/NM-agosto-09-.pdf, Comisión del.

Successful engineering institutions and productive engineers are not only necessary to create knowledge based economies in developing nations, but they are also important players in maintaining economic viability that is tied to national security of immediate and distant neighbors. The necessity for innovation in engineering education and grounding of this training in local needs and markets is true for all forms of engineering, including biological and biomedical engineering that have been rather recent inductees to the engineering education portfolio. Developing countries are taking biological and biomedical engineering seriously to address issues in food and agriculture, processing and nutrition and various aspects of healthcare and medicine. In this paper we address the need, status, challenges and opportunities for the developing world in bioengineering and biomedical engineering education and discuss ways in which the fundamentals of engineering education can be strengthened for a sustainable society. © 2010 IEEE.","Biological engineering; Biomedical engineering; Developing world","Biological engineering; Developing world; Economic growths; Economic viability; Engineering institutions; Intellectual development; Knowledge based economy; Long-term sustainability; National security; Sustainable society; Biophysics; Developing countries; Economics; Innovation; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Medicine; Sustainable development; Engineering education","Heywood, J., (2005) Engineering Education: Research and Development in Curriculum and Instruction, , Wiley-IEEE Press; (2008) Engineering for the Developing World, , National Academy Press; Bartlett, A.A., Reflections on sustainability, population growth and the environment (1998) Renewable Resources Journal, 15 (4), pp. 6-22; (1999) Our Common Journey: A Transition Toward Sustainability, , NRC (National Research Council).

Nowadays, with no doubt, the Internet, is the usual way to spread any kind of documentation. Authors send the contents of their publications, based on a typical scheme composed by an abstract for a first understanding of the paper, some names, references and a further content development, using textual descriptions and graphical support elements. These parts of the document are conformed in a unique data unit. However, even the article taking part of the congress edition, the access way to it, is made through the digital media given by the congress. So, only if some congress query media are developed, it's successly possible to access to a certain article information. The experience shown in the content of this paper gives a solution to this access problem and bases its development on the information treatment of a congress as digital learning objects. By this way, a technical paper is treated as an information unit which is composed by a data background, essentially the metadata, which are recovered and isolated in every individual documentation. Once a digital object and its metadata are disposed, congress edition conforms a structured data block, accessible not only in the congress scope but outside it. The use of metadata standards, as IEEE-LOM, let to information being built in digital platforms and repositories to be treated as congress information, as an individual article and even, some of its parts, as reusable digital objects © 2010 IEEE.","Learning object; Metadata; Reusable content; Technical article","Communication medium; Congress Proceedings; Content development; Data backgrounds; Data units; Digital media; Digital Objects; Digital platforms; Digital-learning; Information treatment; Learning object metadata; Metadata Standards; Structured data; Technical articles; Textual description; Digital storage; Engineering education; Metadata","(2002) Draft Standard for Learning Object Metadata, , Learning Technology Standards Committee of the IEEE.

The course provides a unique opportunity for third year engineering students from a variety of programs to experience the opportunities and challenges that international teamwork involves. Teams composed of students from two countries work intensively over a 10 to 13 week project cycle to develop a system which allows a user to remote-control a LEGO NXT robot. The teams negotiate the features of their final system with the academic supervisors from the participating Universities, propose a development time-frame and deliverables, and develop and demonstrate a prototype system. This paper uses teaching and learning findings from engineering education research. The evidence is used to arrive at an instructional design that aligns learning outcomes, with instruction and assessment to support student's learning outcomes development throughout the course, We also discuss the evolution of the course over the past 12 years as we moved from a pilot version with eight students from two universities to a large scale course with between sixty and eighty students from between three and five universities distributed over three continents and widely different educational and social cultures. © 2010 IEEE.","Educating the global engineer; Engineering skills; Global virtual teamwork","Development time; Engineering education research; Engineering skills; Finland; Global virtual teamwork; Instructional designs; Large-scale course; Learning outcome; Project cycle; Prototype system; Social culture; Teaching and learning; Teamwork skills; Virtual teamwork; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Management; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching","Peterson, G.D., Quality assurance in the preparation of technical professionals: The ABET perspective (2009) Engineering Education Quality Assurance, pp. 73-83. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-0555-0\_5, [Online].

Therefore, several computer-assisted-assessment systems have been developed. The variance in the application domains of eassessment has a main influence on having different assessment systems in the same university. Since universities have different colleges and specializations based on their types and in order to deliver their assessment activities online, each college is developing or buying assessment system or tools based on its specializations and courses. This has caused some universities to have more than one computer-assisted-assessment system. In this paper, a service-oriented e-assessment system will be suggested to solve this problem. A service-oriented architecture for a generic and flexible assessment system will be provided with crossdomain use cases to show the flexibility of this architecture. © 2010 IEEE.","Assessment services; E-assessment; Middleware for tools interoperability; Modular assessment system; Service-oriented architecture for assessment","Application domains; Assessment activities; Assessment services; Assessment system; Computer assisted; Cross-domain; E-assessment; Flexible assessments; Formative and summative assessments; Higher education; Modular assessment system; Service Oriented; Information services; Interoperability; Middleware; Societies and institutions; Engineering education","Bloom, B.S., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, , Longman; Bull, J., McKenna, C., (2004) Blueprint for Computer Assisted Assessment, , Routledge Falmer; Conole, G., Warburton, B., A review of computer-assisted assessment (2005) ALT-J Research in Learning Technology, 13, pp. 17-31; Olivier, B., Roberts, T., Blinco, K., (2005) The E-framework for Education and Research: An Overview, , www.e-framework.org, retrieved from last retrieved November 1st 2009; Wills, G., An e-learning framework for assessment (FREMA) (2007) Proceedings of 11th CAA Conference; Sclater, N., Howie, K., User requirements of the ""ultimate"" online assessment engine (2003) Computers & Education, 40, pp. 285-306; Al-Smadi, M., Guetl, C., Helic, D., Towards a standardized eassessment system: Motivations, challenges and first findings (2009) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (IJET), 4. , Special Issue 2: ""IMCL2009""; Papazoglou, M.P., (2008) Web Services: Principles and Technology, pp. 22-26. , Printice Hall; The IMS Global Learning Consortium, , http://www.imsglobal.o.ri2/background.html, last retrieved November 7th 2009; The Advanced Distributed Learning, , http://www.admet.gov/about/index.asnx, ADL, last retrieved Octuber 7th 2009; ADL Sharable Courseware Object Reference Model, , http://www.adlnet.gov/scorm/index.aspx, SCORM, last retrieved Octuber 7th 2009; The Aviation Industry CBT (Computer Based Learning) Committee, , http://www.aicc.org/index.html, last retrieved.

Remote experiment is a product used by learners, a part of our society, with the main reason to increase the quality of knowledge. Learners are the consumers (the clients) and teachers are the producers. At limit, one student must to open all of the remote laboratories referred at the same experiment to be able to declare that his knowledge and image about this experiment there is complete. But, similarly with the classic production process, there are a various grades or levels of quality. These differences are the result of the intentional design of the experiment, determined by the level of the laboratories endowment, of the level of Internet connection, the type and complexity of the subjects approached in the remote way, the acceptance of national language or of the English ones. All of the above factors being intentional, the quality aspects are named QUALITY of DESIGN. There are other factors which influenced the quality of the remote laboratory. They are: hardware and software utilized for the remote experiment, knowledge level of the producers (teachers) and of the consumers (students), type of quality assurance system in use inside of the schools, assessment and evaluation rules applied for the student knowledge, etc.. This group of factors will determine QUALITY of CONFORMANCE, indicating how well the laboratory works (as product) conforms to the specifications required by each training system who intend to use the remote experiment network. There is a considerable necessity of the clarifications about quality in the field of the remote laboratory network, many times above notions being often used without a clear distinction. Being a global system, the remote experiment network includes an unavoidable conflict between quality of design, which represents a local decision and quality of conformance, which is a global requirement. As a result, in the paper the authors want to propose the application of some statistics methods, to do the above distinction and to start new approach regarding quality assessment in the remote experiment network. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; F ratio; Null hypothesis; Oc curve; Quality of conformance; Quality of design; Remote experiment; Sampling","F ratio; Null hypothesis; OC curve; Quality of conformance; Quality of design; Remote experiments; Design; Engineering education; Flow patterns; Internet; Laboratories; Learning systems; Production engineering; Quality assurance; Quality control; Students; Total quality management; Experiments","Keppcl, G., (1973) Design and Analysis, pp. 30-38. , a researcher's handbook, Prentice Hall, inc, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Hays, W.L., (1963) Statistics for Psychologists, pp. 362-364. , New York, Holt,Reinhard and Winston; Winer, B.J., (1962) Statistical Principles in Experimental Design, p. 51. , New York, Mc Graw Hill; Samoila, S., Ursutiu, D., Cotfas, P., Cotfas, D., Remote experiment and memorize IMCL-2009 Conference, , 21-14 April, Amman Jordan; Edwards, A.L., (1968) Experimental Design in Psychological Research, , New York, Holt Rinehart and Winston; Samoila, C., Ursutiu, D., Logofatu, B., Multi-channel learning, will move blended learning in collaborative learning? -Full PaperICBL-2007 Conference-7-8 Mai-2007- Florianopolis, , Brazil, Editor M/Auer and J.Golberi, Kassel Press, ISBN 978-3-89958-277-2; Samoila, C., Ursutiu, D., Cotfas, P., Enhancing engineering education through remote experiment (2006) Symposium on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation, pp. 63-70. , REV2006, Maribor - Slovenia, 29-30 June, ISBN 3-89958-194-6, Kassel Press-Editor M.Auer; Samoila, C., Ursutiu, D., Quality in e-learning. compulsory decision?

Our nation is rapidly becoming more diverse due to growth in groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in technical fields. Nowhere is this underrepresentation more evident than in academia. It was determined that one potential way to attract more underrepresented students to pursue engineering careers was to increase the diversity of the engineering faculty, proving powerful role models to potential technical students. Therefore, over 10 years ago, NSF began a program that sought to diversify the Nation's faculty in engineering, science and mathematics fields, called the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP). The AGEP Program is now a national network of multi-institution alliances. Nationally, the AGEP program has recorded significant gains in doctoral degrees awarded to underrepresented minorities in engineering. The Southeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (SEAGEP) Program includes the University of Florida, Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina. SEAGEP is the top producer of Hispanic PhDs in the country and is third in the production of African American PhDs in engineering.

However, this increase is not reflected in every field of study; computer science and engineering are among those that have decreased each year, evidence of a decline of interest in following this career on the part of students. As a response to this disturbing fact, this paper aims to identify some of the possible consequences that this trend could produce in Europe. It will highlight the impacts in economic, social, political and pedagogical fields and explain how these segments will be affected if the decline in computer science persists. Supported by previous investigations and official reports, this analysis provides some examples of the problems already produced by the declining interest in computer science in Europe and proposes solutions such as teaching methods and learning strategies to attract more students to this field and therefore limit the negative effects in a near future. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; Computer science studies; Learning methods; Teaching methods","Computer science and engineerings; Learning methods; Learning strategy; Teaching methods; Tertiary education; Computational methods; Computer crime; Computer science; Learning systems; Professional aspects; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Official European Statistics, , Eurostat, 20002006; (2009), http://www.cra.org/govaffairs/blog/archives/000729.html, Computing research policy, Advocacy and Policy Analysis for the Computing Research Community; Mahar, J., Virtual Outreach through virtual worlds: A model for attracting and keeping women in computing (2008) ACCE Elearn Conference; (2006) Evolution of the Joung Interest Fot the Scientific and Technological Studies - Évolution de L'intérêt des Jeunes Pour les Études Scientifiques et Technologiques., , OCDE, Rapport d'orientation.

Both types of learning resources can easily be shared between universities or industrial partners, leading to dramatic reductions in the costs associated with development, construction, operation and maintenance of traditional laboratory set-ups; however, each is characterised by inherent advantages and disadvantages. We compare and contrast remote experiments and virtual labs, using two case studies: 'Cambridge Weblab', a remote experiment built by the Computational Modeling (CoMo) Group at the University of Cambridge and 'SRM web-suite', a virtual lab developed by CMCL innovations. The Cambridge Weblab remote experiment uses a Siemens SIMATIC PS7 industrial interface to control a chemical reactor, yielding authentic experiences of industrial practices for students. A variety of pedagogical approaches employed by institutions using the Weblab are also discussed in this paper. The SRM web-suite uses an advanced engine design tool that simulates fuels, combustion and emissions in conventional and advanced internal combustion engines. The detailed simulations have been precisely tailored for training and educational settings. The web-suite labs provide students and engineering professionals with experience using the latest industry-standard technology, whilst supporting a wide range of educational goals e.g. undergraduate courses in combustion engines or chemical reaction engineering and advanced courses in futuristic fuels or powertrain engineering. We also assess the potential impact of these learning resources within the panEuropean Library of Labs (LiLa) framework. Ultimately, we demonstrate that remote experiments and virtual laboratories are complementary, that there is significant potential for future integration of the two technologies, and that both can benefit from the latest industrial technologies. © 2010 IEEE.","Advanced combustion engines; Chemical process control; Library of labs (lila); Remote experiments; Virtual laboratories","Cambridge; Chemical process control; Chemical reaction engineering; Combustion engines; Computational modeling; Educational goals; Educational settings; Engine design; Engineering professionals; Industrial partners; Industrial practices; Industrial technology; Learning resource; Operation and maintenance; Pedagogical approach; Potential impacts; Powertrain engineering; Remote experiments; Set-ups; Siemens; Standard technology; Undergraduate Courses; University of Cambridge; Virtual lab; Virtual laboratories; Chemical engineering; Chemical reactors; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Digital libraries; Engineering; Engineering education; Engines; Ergonomics; Industry; Internal combustion engines; Laboratories; Machine design; Process control; Students; Teaching; Technology; Experiments","Aktan, B., Bohus, C.A., Crowl, L.A., Shor, M.H., Distance learning applied to control engineering laboratories (1996) IEEE Transactions on Education, 39 (3), pp. 320-326. , PII S001893599606757X; Nedic, Z., Machotka, J., Nafalski, A., Remote laboratories versus virtual and real laboratories (2003) 34th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 1-6. , session T3E-1, November; Ewald, H., Page, G.F., Performing experiments by remote control using the internet (2001) Global Journal of Engineering Education, 4 (3), pp. 287-292; González-Castaño, F., Anido-Rifón, L., Vales-Alonso, J., Fernández-Iglesias, M., Nistal, M.L., Rodríguez-Hernández, P., Pousada-Carballo, J., Internet access to real equipment at computer architecture laboratories using the java/corba paradigm (2001) Computers & Education, 36, pp. 151-170; Ogot, M., Elliott, G., Glumac, N., An assessment of in-person and remotely operated laboratories (2003) Journal of Engineering Education, 92 (1), pp. 57-64; Ogot, M., Elliott, G.S., Glumac, N., Hands-on laboratory experience via remote control: Jet thrust laboratory (2002) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, , Session 2666; Skliar, M., Price, J.W., Tyler, A., Experimental projects in teaching process control (1998) Chemical Engineering Education, 32 (4), pp. 254-259; Selmer, A., Kraft, M., Moros, R., Colton, C.K., Weblabs in chemical engineering education (2007) Education for Chemical Engineers, 2, pp. 38-45; http://icampus.mit.edu/iLabs/, November 2009; Jeschke, S., Richter, T., Scheel, H., Thomsen, C., One remote and virtual experiments in eLearning (2007) Journal of Software, 2 (6), pp. 76-85; http://www.nano-world.org/, November 2009; http://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www/802TEAL3D/visualizations/faraday/ fallingcoilapp/fallingcoilapp.htm, , November 2009; Corter, J.E., Nickerson, J.V., Esche, S.K., Chassapis, C., Remote versus hands-on labs: A comparative study (2004) 34th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 17-21. , session F1G, October; Selmer, A., Goodson, M., Kraft, M., Sen, S., McNeil, V.F., Johnston, B.S., Colton, C.K., Performing process control experiments across the atlantic (2005) Chemical Engineering Education, 39 (3), pp. 232-237; Mosbach, S., Celnik, M.S., Raj, A., Kraft, M., Zhang, H., Kubo, S., Kim, K.-O., Towards a detailed soot model for internal combustion engines (2009) Combustion and Flame, 156 (6), pp. 1156-1165; Jacobson, M.J., Kim, B., Pathak, S.A., Zhang, B., Learning the physics of electricity with agent-based models: Fail first and structure later?

By using distance learning tools, the student education can be more flexible with respect to place and time constraints. So, students can access information in every time and everywhere either in libraries or during the lectures. As is widely known that, distance learning is costly, and cost-effectiveness becomes more important as the institutions become large-scale providers of distance education. Cost which is the most important disadvantages of distance learning according to traditional learning environments can be removed with the extensive features of the Open Source Software. Generalizing the usage of Open Source Software will provide development of learning tools and increases the educational quality. As far as the literature is reviewed, not much research has already been conducted about the comparisons of open source learning management systems in distance education. In this study, some analyses and comparisons were made about open source learning management systems and Moodle was outstanding with many features among other LMS that aims to improve the educational quality and include the tools that an e-learning system should have. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; Distance learning; Learning management system; Moodle; Open source lms","Distance learning; Distance learning tools; Internet usage; Learning management system; Learning tool; New technologies; Open Source Software; Open sources; Open-source learning; Student education; Time constraints; Traditional learning; Computer software; E-learning; Management; Open systems; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Garrett, R., (2002) Leading Learning Platforms: International Market Presence, , http://www.obhe.ac.uk/documents/view-details?id=575, March 2009, retrieved January, 2002 from Observatory on Borderless Higher Education Web site; Hall, B., (2003) New Technology Definitions, , http://www.brandonhall.com/public/glossary/index.htm, retrieved August 5, 2003 from; Kis, M., (2007) Upon Learning Management Systems, , http://kodveus.blogspot.com/2007-03-01-archive.html, Retrieved July 10, 2007, from; Kritikou, Y., Demestichas, P., Adamopoulou, E., Demestichas, K., Theologou, M., Paradia, M., User Profile modelling in the context of web-based Learning management systems (2008) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 31 (4), pp. 603-627; Miller, R.L., Learning benefits of interactive technologies (1990) Multimedia and Videodisc Monitor, p. 14. , February; (2008) Netcraft Survey, , http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/01/16/january-2009-web-server- survey.html, Retrieved December 25; (2005) The Applicability of Open Source Software in Public Agencies, , Republic of Turkey State Planning Organisation (1st ed.).

The government is strongly encouraging engagement between universities and employers. Work-based learning is increasingly found in first and second cycle programmes, along with modules designed by employers and increasing use of distance learning. Engineering faculties are playing a leading part in these developments, and the Engineering Council, the engineering professional bodies and some universities are collaborating to develop work-based learning programmes as a pathway to professional qualification. While potentially beneficial to the engineering profession, these developments pose a challenge to traditional approaches to programme accreditation. This paper explores how this system deals with these challenges and highlights the issues that will have to be addressed to ensure that the system can cope effectively with change, especially the development of individually tailored, work-based second cycle programmes, while maintaining appropriate standards and international confidence. © 2010 SEFI.","Accreditation; Employers; Work-based learning","Accreditation; Distance education; Professional aspects; Demographic trends; employers; Engineering faculty; Engineering profession; Engineering professionals; Professional qualifications; Traditional approaches; Work-Based Learning; Engineering education","(2004) Sustaining the Change, , http://www.abet.org/Linked%20Documents-UPDATE/White%20Papers/Sustaining%20the%20Change-Web.pdf#search=sustainingthechange, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, [online].

Likewise, podcasts are helping to facilitate a stronger student identity and community within learning environments, replacing traditional student newsletter and website approaches. In this work, an innovative podcasting approach is presented in which there is a strong student-centred and student-led premise to foster and advance engineering education-related uses. Podcasts are intended to cover a range of relevant engineering topics, such as sharing student views on global, institutional and scientific developments and disseminating information on unique educational opportunities. Details on the design, set-up and implementation of the initiative are presented (e.g. resource requirements, management and organisation structures, maintenance of balanced educational outcomes). An evaluation of the experiences of the team members is also presented, showing favourable outcomes in skills development, community identity and broader educational awareness. © 2010 SEFI.","Podcasting; Student-led projects","Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Information dissemination; Communication method; Community identities; Educational opportunities; Flexible resources; Learning environments; Podcasting; Resource requirements; Scientific development; Students","Alpay, E., Engineering education developments through EnVision (2008) Proceedings of The 7th AnnualASEE Global Colloquium On Engineering Education, , Washington, DC; Armstrong, G.R., Tucker, J.M., Massad, V.J., Interviewing the experts: Student produced podcasts (2009) Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations In Practice, 8, pp. 79-90; Campbell, G., There's something in the air: Podcasting in education (2005) Educase Review, 40 (8), pp. 33-46; Copley, J., Audio and video podcasts of lectures for campus-based students: Production and evaluation of student use (2007) Innovations In Education and Teaching International, 44, pp. 387-399; Dale, C., Strategies for using podcasting to support student learning (2007) Journal of Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism Education, 6 (1), pp. 49-57; Edirisingha, P., Salmon, G., (2007) Pedagogical Methods For Podcasts In Higher Education, , LRA/BDRA demonstration file.

SPEED is a global, non-profit student organisation that functions as an interdisciplinary network to diversify dialogue, stimulate change and impact the development of EE and its effect on society. SPEED is directly attracting young people to engineering in various ways: the organisation of its keynote event, the Global Student Forum; facilitating interactions between globally minded, socially inclined engineers with aspirations to change the world; and through the global dissemination of SPEED's work and practices through broad and relevant channels. Short-term outcomes are highlighted here.

Normally, it is assumed that young people shy away from 'tough majors' or make irrational choices, based on an absence of information. While not denying the fundamental necessity that a higher proportion of the population should have a background in S&T, this paper pursues a different approach. Only by identifying potentially valid reasons for the lack of interest in S&T will it be possible to change not just some 'misguided' perceptions among the younger generation, but to categorise the facts and make targeted recommendations for necessary changes. Therefore, this article will discuss the importance of image and status, the influence of society and peer groups, as well as financial rewards and career aspects. It will be shown that the universally observable trend away from S&T is not due to a dislike of technology on the part of the younger generation, but is caused by the fact that careers in this field do not seem attractive enough, especially in comparison with alternatives available in developed countries. Some recommendations to improve this situation are offered. © 2010 SEFI.","Career perspectives; Engineering education; Salaries; Shortage of engineers; Women in engineering","Compensation (personnel); Engineering education; Engineers; Wages; Career aspect; career perspectives; Developed countries; Financial rewards; Science and Technology; Women in engineering; Young peoples; Younger generations; Professional aspects","(2009) Viele Soziale Aufsteiger Unter Den Professoren Der Ingenieurwissen-Schaften Und Der Informatik, , http://www.4ing-online.de/fileadmin/uploads/presse/20100104.pdf, 4Ing, [online], Available from, [Accessed June 2010]; Abbot, A., (2003) The Zen of Education, , http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0310/features/zen.shtml, [online].Available from, [Accessed January 2010]; Alpay, Student enthusiasm for engineering: Charting changes in student aspirations and motivation (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (5-6), pp. 573-585; Becker, F.S., Globalization, curricula reform and the consequences for engineers working in an international company (2006) European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (3), pp. 261-272; Becker, F.S., Generation 21: What markets require, what active students can do and how a company can help them.

(2008-2009). It aimed at exploring whether interdisciplinary, innovative teaching/learning settings in the fields of technology and digital media can be used to give pupils the opportunities to experiment and discover their technical potential, skills, interests and talents and if music technology could offer such an appealing context. The paper explains how technology and why gender need to be addressed when planning to raise young people's interest in technology but questions if interest in technology is mainly influenced by gender. The paper explores through ethnographic research how pupils' technological competencies and interests have developed during the course of a technology-related project. Results of the analysis explain how music technology can serve as a suitable theme with the potential to increase both males' and females' interest in technology. © 2010 SEFI.","Curriculum design; Engineering education; Gender; Music technology; Participatory technology design; Technology and science education","Digital storage; Curriculum designs; gender; Music technologies; Science education; Technology designs; Engineering education","Bammé, A., (1988) Technologische Zivilisation und die Transformation des Wissens, , München: Profil; Becker, F.S., Why not opt for a career in science and technology?

This is despite the opinion of many academics that large classes have negative effects on the learning outcomes of first year students. The University of South Australia is also faced with low motivation amongst engineering students studying non-major courses. In 2006, a project-based laboratory was successfully introduced for first year students enrolled in electrical disciplines, which increased student satisfaction, reduced the attrition rate and improved students' success rate. This paper presents the experiences with the project-based laboratory's implementation in three different projects in the common first year course, Electrical and Energy Systems, where each project aims to increase the motivation of students in one of three disciplines: electrical, mechanical or civil engineering. © 2010 SEFI.","Common first year; Engineering education; Project-based laboratory","Engineering education; Laboratories; Motivation; Electrical engineering course; Engineering disciplines; First year; First year students; Learning outcome; Project-based; Student satisfaction; University of South Australia; Students","Cartwright, K.V., Further results related to power supply design and analysis in the undergraduate curriculum (2001) IEEE Transactions On Education, 44 (3), pp. 262-267; Dochy, F., Effects of problem-based learning: A meta-analysis (2003) Learning and Instruction, 13 (5), pp. 533-568; Everingham, T., (2008) EEET 1025 Electrical and Energy Systems - Practical Guide - Moisture Probe, p. 50. , University of South Australia: School of Electrical and Information Engineering; Everingham, T., (2008) EEET 1025 Electrical and Energy Systems - Practical Guide - Racing Car, p. 50. , University of South Australia: School of Electrical and Information Engineering; Göl, O., Nafalski, A., McDermott, K., The role of industry-inspired projects in engineering education (2001) Proceedings of 31st ASEE/IEEE Frontiers In Education Conference, 2. , http://www.fie-conference.org/fie2001/papers/1025.pdf, Reno, USA, F3E-1-4, Available from, [Accessed June 2010]; (1996) Changing the Culture: Engineering Education Into the Future, , Johnson, P., ed., Canberra: Institution of Engineers Australia; Kolmos, A., Reflections on project work and problem-based learning (1996) European Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (2), pp. 141-148; Kolmos, A., Problem-based and project-based learning (2009) University Science and Mathematics Education In Transition, pp. 261-280. , In: O.

Despite this work and the research of others, a significant number of students and, indeed, many academics focus on the free-rider deterrent capability of self and peer assessment, rather than its capacity to provide opportunities for developing judgement and facilitating reflection and feedback to complete the learning cycle. The advent of web-based tools such as SPARKPLUS allows the frequent and efficient implementation of self and peer assessment activities even in large classes. This article reports the results of an investigation into whether the regular use of self and peer assessment in different contexts promoted effective peer learning, increased engagement and encouraged students to learn. © 2010 SEFI.","Collaborative peer learning; Self and peer assessment; SPARKPLUS; Teamwork","Education; Engineering education; Efficient implementation; Free-riders; Learning cycle; Learning outcome; Peer assessment; Peer learning; teamwork; Web-based tools; Students","Black, P., Wiliam, D., Assessment and classroom learning (1998) Assessment In Education: Principles, Policy & Practice, 5 (1), p. 7; Boud, D., Falchikov, N., (2007) Rethinking Assessment In Higher Education Learning For the Longer Term, , London: Routledge; Carless, D., Learning-oriented assessment: Conceptual bases and practical implications (2007) Innovations In Education and Teaching International, 44 (1), pp. 57-66; Falchikov, N., Goldfinch, J., Student peer assessment in higher education: A meta-analysis comparing peer and teacher marks (2000) Review of Educational Research, 70 (3), pp. 287-322; Freeman, M., McKenzie, J., SPARK, a confidential web-based template for self and peer assessment of student teamwork: Benefits of evaluating across different subjects (2002) British Journal of Educational Technology, 33, pp. 551-569; Goldfinch, J., Further developments in peer assessment of group projects (1994) Assessment & Evaluation In Higher Education, 19, p. 29; Goldfinch, J., Raeside, R., Development of a peer assessment technique for obtaining individual marks on a group project (1990) Assessment and Evaluation In Higher Education, 15 (3), pp. 210-231; Hanrahan, S., Isaacs, G., Assessing self- and peer-assessment: The students'views (2001) Higher Education Research & Development, 20 (1), pp. 53-70; Keppell, M., Carless, D., Learning-oriented assessment: A technology-based case study (2006) Assessment In Education, 13 (2), pp. 179-191; Keppell, M., Peer learning and learning-oriented assessment in technology-enhanced environments (2006) Assessment & Evaluation In Higher Education, 31 (4), pp. 453-464; Mello, J.A., Improving individual member accountability in small work group settings (1993) Journal of Management Education, 17 (2), pp. 253-259; Michaelsen, L., Knight, A., Fink, L., (2004) Team-based Learning - a Transformative Use of Small Groups In College Teaching, , Herndon, VA: Sylus Publishing; Rust, C., O'Donovan, B., Price, M., A social constructivist assessment process model: How the research literature shows us this could be best practice (2005) Assessment & Evaluation In Higher Education, 30 (3), pp. 231-240; Somervell, H., Issues in assessment, enterprise and higher education: The case for self-, peer and collaborative assessment (1993) Assessment & Evaluation In Higher Education, 18, pp. 221-233; Torrance, H., Assessment as learning?

This paper reviews the Master's programs in construction engineering and management (CEM) offered by departments of civil engineering in the United States. The findings indicate that only 20% of the American educational institutions, which offer accredited civil engineering programs, offer Master's programs in CEM. Most of the Master's programs in CEM constitute an effort to convey information to students on mainly six categories, namely, contract administration, project management, scheduling, equipment management, construction technology, and CEM research. It seems that the Master's programs in CEM do not differ much from program to program in terms of content. When the trends in course offerings are compared in 1982, 1996, and 2008, there seems to be minimal change except for the number of courses in project management that went up significantly while the number of courses in cost estimating went down. The trends in the remaining courses have been stable. Even though contents and trends in CEM programs appear to be relatively stable, there seems to be some variability in the concentration of the course offerings. Some CEM programs concentrate on some of the categories at the expense of other categories. A close relationship and a sound dialogue between construction educators and the industry are likely to lead to Master's programs that are in sync with the expectations of the industry. © 2010 ASCE.","Civil engineering education; Construction management; Graduate programs","Civil engineering programs; Concentration of; Construction engineering; Construction management; Construction process; Construction technologies; Contract administration; Cost estimating; Educational institutions; Equipment management; Graduate education; Graduate program; Graduate programs; Civil engineering; Computational electromagnetics; Construction equipment; Engineering; Management; Scheduling; Engineering education","Arditi, D., Graduate education in construction management (1984) Constr.

The earlier model and associated teaching materials for a lesson based around a river valley flooding problem for small groups of 6th grade pupils were modified and trialed with a larger group of 8th grade pupils. Subsequently a further lesson using the same model framework was developed based around groundwater contamination from landfill leachate. This was trialed with small groups of both 6th and 8th grade pupils. A competitive element in landfill liner design was introduced into the lessons. The model and lessons received praise and were shown to achieve their aims of teaching SD in a memorable and practical context and explaining something of civil engineering, though the smaller group lessons were found to be much more successful than the larger group lesson. © 2010 ASCE.","Civil engineering; Engineering education; Models; Schools; Sustainable development; Teaching methods","Civil engineers; Education for sustainable development; Further development; Groundwater contamination; Interactive models; Landfill leachates; Landfill liner; Model framework; River valley; Small groups; Teaching materials; Teaching methods; Civil engineering; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Leachate treatment; Leaching; Models; Refuse disposal; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Teaching; Engineering education","Civil engineering enrolment decreases (1998) Civ.

This statement has not yet been fully supported by research, especially in developing countries such as Algeria. The purpose of this paper was to identify directions for addressing the needs of academics in higher education institutions in Algeria in order to adopt the e-learning approach as a strategy to improve quality of education. The paper will report results of an empirical study that measures the readiness of the Algerian higher education institutions towards the implementation of ICT in the educational process and the attitudes of faculty members towards the application of the e-learning approach in engineering education. Three main objectives were targeted, namely: (a) to provide an initial evaluation of faculty members' attitudes and perceptions towards web-based education; (b) reporting on their perceived requirements for implementing e-learning in university courses; (c) providing an initial input for a collaborative process of developing an institutional strategy for e-learning. Statistical analysis of the survey results indicates that the Algerian higher education institution, which adopted the Licence - Master and Doctorate educational system, is facing a big challenge to take advantage of emerging technological innovations and the advent of e-learning to further develop its teaching programmes and to enhance the quality of education in engineering fields. The successful implementation of this modern approach is shown to depend largely on a set of critical success factors that would include: The extent to which the institution will adopt a formal and official e-learning strategy. The extent to which faculty members will adhere and adopt this strategy and develop ownership of the various measures in the context of their teaching and research responsibilities. The extent to which the university will offer adequate support in terms of training, software platform administration, online resource development and impact monitoring and assessment. © 2010 SEFI.","Algerian higher education; e-learning; Engineering education; Information and communication technologies; Quality",,"Altbach, P.G., Reisberg, L., Rumbley, L.E., Trends in global higher education: Tracking an academic resolution (2009) UNESCO 2009 World Conference On Higher Education, , 6-8, July, Paris, France; Barasubramanian, K., Les TIC au service de l'Enseignement Superieur (2009) UNESCO 2009 World Conference On Higher Education, , 6-8, July, Paris, France; Barnatt, C., Higher education 2.0 (2008) International Journal of Management Education, 7 (3), pp. 47-56; Broadbent, B., (2002) E-learning, Present and Future, , www.e-learninghub.com/docs/ODLG_2002.pdf, [online].

Specifically, we present a comparison between results obtained for a controlled layout simulated both by physical and computational models. This particular experience is based on a Venturi tube. In the laboratory of the Multidisciplinary Center for Fluid Modeling (CMMF), we have implemented a suitable assembly to simulate different Venturi-related phenomena and to take measurements in an intrusion.ow forced by the pressure.eld into the perforated Venturi tube. The same geometry has been reproduced using a CFD code, and both pressure and velocity values have been compared. By doing this comparison, we.rst provide awareness to our students about the importance of calibration, then show them the agreement between measured and computed values, and.nally design a methodology for students to visualize pressure and velocity.elds by means of a number of graphical displays of the results.

International placements offer some important pedagogical advantages, but also have some practical and ethical limitations. Local community-based placements have the potential to be transformative for both the student and the community, although this potential is not always seen. In order to investigate the role of local placements, qualitative research interviews were conducted. Thirty-two semi-structured research interviews were conducted and analysed, resulting in a distinct outcome space. It is concluded that local humanitarian engineering placements greatly complement international placements and are strongly recommended if international placements are conducted. More importantly it is seen that we are better suited to address the marginalised in our own community, although it is often easier to see the needs of an outside populace. © 2010 SEFI.","Engineering education; Humanitarian engineering; Local placement; Service learning; Social justice",,"Amadei, B., Program in engineering for developing communities: Viewing the developing world as the classroom for the 21st century (2003) Proceedings of The Frontiers In Education Conference, , Boulder, CO, 5-8 November, 2003; Borg, J.P., Zitomer, D.H., Dual-team model for international service learning in engineering: Remote solar water pumping in Guatemala (2008) Journal of Professional Issues In Engineering Education and Practice, 134 (2), pp. 178-185; Bowden, J., Reflections on the phenomenographic research process.

As an example, robots have been successfully used to teach a wide range of subjects, from introductory programming to artificial intelligence. As a discipline, wearable computing is seen to be practical, yet futuristic and exciting, and it captures the attention and interest of people who might not otherwise be drawn to technology. Recent developments in this field have also raised the possibility of moving wearable computing construction within the reach of hobbyists and novices. However, there still exist substantial obstacles toward the adoption of wearable computing into education. This paper presents a framework with the objective of facilitating the integration of wearable computing into outreach and introductory computer science and engineering education. We also present a comprehensive evaluation of our platform, including a comparison with the current practice of sewing-based wearable computing. © 2008 IEEE.","Computer and information science education; Programming environments/construction tools; Wearable computers and body area networks.","Body Area Network; Comprehensive evaluation; Computing education; Current practices; Information science education; Innovative method; Introductory computer science; Introductory programming; Programming environments/construction tools; Wearable computing; Wearable computing platform; Artificial intelligence; Computer networks; Education computing; Engineering education; Information science; Integration; Intelligent robots; Robot programming; Wearable computers; Computer systems programming","Maloney, J., Rusk, N., Burd, L., Silverman, B., Kafai, Y., Resnick, M., Scratch: A sneak preview (2004) Proceedings - Second International Conference on Creating, Connecting and Collaborating Through Computing, pp. 104-109. , Proceedings - Second International Conference on Creating, Connecting and Collaborating through Computing; Conway, M., Audia, S., Burnette, T., Cosgrove, D., Christiansen, K., Alice: Lessons learned from building a 3D system for novices (2000) Proc.

Authorities within supervising universities have realized that strong research by a candidate is often obscured by poor presentation, leading to the paper being ignored by the research community and journal reviewers. On the basis of their academic background, the writers of this paper decided to form a set of clear guidelines for writing research papers and giving oral presentations aimed at helping Ph.D. students. To support the effectiveness of the methodology proposed, a statistical analysis has been conducted. The methodology described in this paper was initially intended for use in the fields of computer engineering; however, it is applicable more widely. In conclusion, if the methodology reported in this paper is followed strictly, it is much less likely that a good piece of work would be rejected for publication, and/or remain anonymous, due to inadequate presentation. © 2010 ASCE.","Communication; Engineering education; Ethodology; Methodology; PhD; Presentation; Research; Structure; Writing","Communication engineering; Computer engineering; Oral presentations; Research communities; Research papers; Research results; Research structure; Statistical analysis; Research; Engineering education","Alley, M., Neeley, K.A., Rethinking the design of presentation slides: A case for sentence headlines and visual evidence (2005) Soc.

Teachers were introduced to sensors, instrumentation, and engineering in a planned and integrated learning environment. Guided training consisting of lectures, tutorials, structured engineering workshops, and discussions exposed the teachers to foundational elements of engineering through the use of sensors and computerized data acquisition, which were presented as vital tools to be used in engineering and science education and profession. By the end of the WISE project, participants completed 70 h of in-class professional development. In addition, learning continued into the evenings and weekend, as participants took part in activities that exposed them to contemporary engineering concerns and projects. These supplemental activities provided an additional 15 h of professional development. Exposure to a hands-on, technology-rich, multidisciplinary learning experience in the workshop has prepared the participating teachers to provide their students with enriched learning opportunities and stimulate them to seek higher achievement in science and mathematics.

This paper discusses a laboratory-based course that provides realistic hands-on manufacturing experiences to students. The course uses team-based projects that help students gain hands-on experience with selected manufacturing processes. The projects start with simple components that can be made on a single machine such as a lathe or a mill, and progress to the manufacture and assembly of a fully functional mechanism. This approach introduces students to the issues involved in putting together a non-trivial assembly. Multiple evaluation tools including focus groups, surveys, and actual observations, were used to assess the effectiveness of the approach used. The results indicate that this is indeed an effective way of addressing industry concerns.","Competency gap; Experiential learning; Learning factory","Competency gaps; Engineering graduates; Evaluation tool; Experiential learning; Focus groups; Functional mechanisms; Hands-on experiences; Learning factory; Manufacturing process; Non-trivial; Single machines; Team-based projects; Industrial engineering; Machine components; Manufacture; Plant shutdowns; Production engineering; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Felder, R., Reaching the Second Tier: Learning and Teaching Styles in College Science Education (1993) J.

One goal of an engineering capstone design course should be to mesh the technical knowledge of the discipline with an encompassing engineering problem that incorporates ""real world"" issues and challenges. With all of the aforementioned criteria in mind, the objective of Villanova University's structural capstone course described herein is to integrate technical and non-technical issues through a challenging real world project. This paper presents the development, implementation, objectives, and assessment of a structural engineering capstone course that incorporates an international service project. All data indicates that the students participating on the service trip achieve significantly higher non-technical outcomes compared to those students that work solely on the design project.","Assessment; Capstone; Learning objectives; Service learning; Structural engineering","Capstone course; Capstone design course; Civil engineers; Design projects; Engineering problems; Engineering project; International services; Issues and challenges; Learning objectives; Real world projects; Service learning; Structural engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Knowledge engineering; Structural design; Students; Engineering education","Aidoo, J., International Senior Design Projects-More Lessons Learned (2007) Proceedings of the National Capstone Design Course Conference, , Boulder, CO, June; Beyerlein, S., Davis, D., Gerlick, D.J., Trevisan, M., Thompson, P., Harrison, K., Transferable Assessment Instruments for Capstone Engineering Design (2007) Proceedings of the National Capstone Design Course Conference, , Boulder, CO, June; Bielefeldt, A.R., Environmental Engineering Service Learning Projects for Developing Countries (2007) Proceedings of the National Capstone Design Course Conference, , Boulder, CO, June; Dinehart, D.W., Gross, S.P., Development, Implementation, and Outcomes of International Service Learning in Structural Engineering (2007) Proceedings of the National Capstone Design Course Conference, , Boulder, CO, June; Eyler, J., Giles D.E., Jr., Giles, D.E., (1999) Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?, , Jossey-Bass, Inc., San Francisco, CA; Grisso, R.D., Mostaghimi, S., Wolfe, M.L., Community Projects for Capstone Design: Case Study (2007) Proceedings of the National Capstone Design Course Conference, , Boulder, CO, June; Howe, S., Where are we now?

However, Turkey has witnessed a shift in trend from virtually no female participation in engineering to across-the-board pro- portions that dominate other industrialised countries within the 76 years of the founding of the Turkish Republic. This paper describes the largest known direct cross-sectional study of women in engineering in Turkey with over 800 participants. The methods include survey and facilitated focus groups. The study shows that women in Turkey choose engineering mainly because they enjoy the underlying mathematics and science. There is no gender bias on the part of teachers or fellow students; however, women students believe that they have fewer opportunities than male peers and acutely feel the lack of role models. Work- ing professionals in industry or government perceive that women assume a more indirect, supporting role; however, women overall strongly affirm their selection of engineering despite some negative factors. © 2010 SEFI.","Cross-sectional study; Engineering education in turkey; Engineering in turkey; Focus groups; Survey; Women engineers","Education computing; Engineering education; Surveying; Surveys; Cross-sectional study; Focus groups; Gender bias; Role model; Supporting role; Women engineers; Women in engineering; Working professionals; Professional aspects","Arslan, G., Kivrak, S., The lower employment of women in Turkish construction sector (2004) Building and Environment, 39, pp. 1379-1387; Byko, M., Challenges and opportunities for women in science and engineering (2005) JOM, the Journal of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society, 57 (4), pp. 12-15; Fox, M.F., Sonnert, G., Nikiforova, I., Successful programs for undergraduatewomen in science and engineering: Adapting versus adopting the institutional environment (2009) Research In Higher Education, 50, pp. 333-353; Hersh, M., The changing position of women in engineering worldwide (2000) IEEE Transactions On Engineering Management, 47 (3), pp. 345-359; Kusku, F., Ozbilgin, M., Ozkale, L., Against the tide: Gendered prejudice and disadvantage in engineering (2007) Gender, Work & Organization, 14 (2), pp. 109-129; (1996) Turkey; a Country Study.

Until recently, product design has been taught either as a component of mechanical engineering or as a subject within design schools but increasingly there is global recognition of the need for greater synergies between industrial design and engineering training. Product design engineering (PDE) is a new interdisciplinary programme combining the strengths of the industrial design and engineering. This paper examines the emergence of PDE in an environment of critique of conventional engineering education and exemplifies the current spread of programmes endorsing a hybrid programme of design and engineering skills. The paper exemplifies PDE with the analysis of the programme offered at Swinburne University of Technology (Australia), showing how the teaching of 'designerly' thinking to engineers produces a new graduate particularly suited to the current and future environment of produce design practice. The paper concludes with reflections on the significance of this innovative curriculum model for the field of product design and for engineering design in general. © 2010 SEFI.","Engineering design; Engineering education; Industrial design; Product design","Engineering education; Convergence points; Engineering design; Engineering skills; Engineering training; Innovative curricula; Multidisciplinary training; Product design engineering; Swinburne University of Technology; Product design","Andersen, A., Implementation of engineering product design using international student teamwork - to comply with future needs (2001) European Journal of Engineering Education, 26, pp. 179-186; Ashby, M.F., Johnson, K., (2005) Materials and Design: The Art and Science of Material Selection In Product Design, , London: Butterworth-Heinemann; Baillie, C., Walker, P., Fostering creative thinking in student engineers (1998) European Journal of Engineering Education, 23, pp. 35-44; Baxter, M.R., (1995) Product Design: A Practical Guide to Systematic Methods of New Product Development, , London: Chapman and Hall; Beder, S., Beyond technicalities: Expanding engineering thinking (1999) Journal of Professional Issues In Engineering, 125 (1), pp. 12-18; Cropley, D.H., Cropley, A.J., Fostering creativity in engineering undergraduates (2000) High Ability Studies, 11, pp. 207-218; Cross, N., (2006) Designerly Ways of Knowing, , Springer-Verlag Ltd., London; Cross, N., (2008) Engineering Design Methods: Strategies For Product Design, , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester (fourth edition; Denayer, I., Teaching a structured approach to the design process for undergraduate engineering students by problem-based education (2003) European Journal of Engineering Education, 28, pp. 203-214; Dym, C.A., Design and design centers in engineering education (1998) Artificial Intelligence For Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing, 12, pp. 43-46; Dym, C.L., Engineering design thinking, teaching, and learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, , January, 103-120; Eekels, J., Guidelines for engineering teachers concerning educating the engineer for innovation and entrepreneurial activity (1987) European Journal of Engineering Education, 12, pp. 259-270; Australia, E., (2008) Review of Australian Higher Education: Submission In Response to The June 2008 Discussion Paper, , Public Policy, Engineers Australia, 31 July, 2008; Goel, V., (1995) Sketches of Thought, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Grasso, D., Martinelli, D., Holistic engineering (2007) Chronicle of Higher Education, 53, pp. B8-B9; Green, G., Kennedy, P., Redefining engineering education: The reflective practice of product design engineering (2001) International Journal of Engineering Education, 17, pp. 3-9; Henderson, K., Flexible sketches and inflexible data bases: Visual communication, conscription devices, and boundary objects in design engineering (1991) Science Technology Human Values, 16, pp. 448-473; Lewis, T.M., Creativity on the teaching agenda (2004) European Journal of Engineering Education, 29, pp. 415-428; Owen, C.L., Design research: Building the knowledge base (1998) Design Studies, 19, pp. 9-20; Qarante, D., Perspectives de l'Enseignement du Design Industriel pour les Ingénieurs (1988) European Journal of Engineering Education, 13 (2), pp. 155-160; Schön, D.A., Wiggins, G., Kinds of seeing and their functions in design (1992) Design Studies, 13 (2), pp. 135-156; Slack, L., (2006) What is Product Design?, , Mies, Switzerland: RotoVision; Stewart, I., The integration of engineering and artistic competencies in a novel engineering programme (1999) Global Journal of Engineering Education, 3, pp. 307-313; (2007) Statistics Book, , Swinburne RQF Report, Swinburne University of Technology VIC, Australia; Ullman, D.G., (1992) The Mechanical Design Process, , NewYork: McGraw-Hill; Ulrich, K.T., Eppinger, S.D., (2000) Product Design and Development, , Boston: Irwin/McGraw-Hill; Wulf, W., How shall we satisfy the long-term educational needs of engineers (2000) Proceedings of The IEEE, 88 (4), pp. 593-596","de Vere, I.; Faculty of Design, , Prahran, VIC 3181, Australia; email: IDeVere@swin.edu.au",03043797,,,"English","Eur.

The focus is on: (a) maximising opportunities for students to share their knowledge with practitioners by joining communities of practice, and (b) increasing their intrinsic motivation by creating conditions for student's relatedness. The case study considers a last year capstone course in Mechani- cal Engineering. The work addresses innovative practices of active learning and beyond project-oriented learning through: (a) the development of a web-based decision support system, (b) meetings between the communities of students, maintenance engineers and academics, and (c) new off-campus group instances. The author hypothesises that this multi-modal approach increases deep learning and social impact of the educational process. Surveys to the actors support a successful achievement of the educational goals. The methodology can easily be extended to further improve the learning process. © 2010 SEFI.","Active learning; Engineering education; Mechanical engineering; Project organised learning; Teamwork","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Joining; Mechanical engineering; Students; Active Learning; Communities of Practice; Innovative practices; Maintenance engineers; project organised learning; Project oriented learning; teamwork; Web-based decision support systems; Engineering education","Barrella, E., Buffinton, K., Corporate assessment of strategic issues in technology and management education (2004) Proceedings of The American Society For Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition, (2004). , Salt Lake City, Utah, June 20-23; Bloom, B., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals.

The idea is for suitably qualified undergraduates to assist in the running of weekly first-year tutorials. They mark submitted work, provide written and verbal feedback and lead problem-solving discussions during tutorials. However, contrary to normal practice, the marks they award do not contribute to the students'end-of-year total; all tutorialwork becomes essentially voluntary.We report results from a pilot implementation of the scheme over a 12 month period in an engineering department at a leading academic institution. The scheme was such that a comparative and triangulated assessment was possible among the students and tutor team. Results show no discernible degradation in student attendance, submission rates and performance in either the weekly exercises or end-of-year examinations. Important benefits to the peer tutors are also found. © 2010 SEFI.","Formative assessment; Peer-assisted learning; Tutorials","Education; Engineering education; Academic institutions; Engineering department; Formative assessment; Peer-assisted learning; Pilot implementation; Student attendances; Student learning; tutorials; Students","Anderson, G., Boud, D., Extending the role of peer learning in university courses (1996) Research and Development In Higher Education, 19, pp. 15-19; Ashwin, P., Peer support: Relations between the context, process and outcomes for the students who are supported (2002) Instructional Science, 31, pp. 159-173; Congos, D.H., Mack, A., Supplemental instruction's impact in two freshman chemistry classes: Research, modes of operation, and anecdotes (2005) Research & Teaching In Developmental Education, 21 (2), pp. 43-64; Dochy, F., Segers, M., Sluijsmans, D., The use of self-, peer and co-assessment in higher education: A review (1999) Studies In Higher Education, 24 (3), pp. 331-350; Donelan, M., Wallace, J., Peer support programmes - a truly co-operative initiative (1998) Students Supporting Students, pp. 11-22. , In: J.

An interactive approach enables students to improve their technical capabilities, as well as developing both verbal and written communicative ability. Problem solving and communication skills are vital for engineering students; in the workplace they will be required to communicate with people of varying technical abilities and from different linguistic and engineering backgrounds. In this paper, a case study is presented that discusses how the traditional method of teaching control systems can be improved. 'Control systems' is a complex engineering topic requiring students to process an extended amount of mathematical formulae. MATLAB software, which enables students to interactively compare a range of possible combinations and analyse the optimal solution, is used to this end. It was found that students became more enthusiastic and interested when given ownership of their learning objectives. As well as improving the students'technical knowledge, other important engineering skills are also improved by introducing an interactive method of teaching. © 2010 SEFI.","Control engineering; Electrical engineering; Interactive learning; Matlab; Non english- speakers","Control engineering; Control systems; Educational technology; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Learning systems; MATLAB; Communicative abilities; Control systems education; Development and testing; Interactive learning; Interactive problem solving; Mathematical formulas; non English-speakers; Technical capabilities; Students","Amenkhienan, C.A., Kogan, L.R., Engineering students'perceptions of academic activities and support services: Factors that influence their academic performance (2004) College Student Journal, 38 (4), p. 523; Biggs, J., (2003) Teaching For Quality Learning At University, , NewYork: McGraw-Hill; Boiarsky, C., Teaching engineering students to communicate effectively: A metacognitive approach (2004) The International Journal of Engineering Education, 20 (2), pp. 251-260; Brockbank, A., McGill, I., (1998) Facilitating Reflective Learning In Higher Education, , Buckingham: McGraw-Hill; Candlin, C., Murphy, D., Towards task-based language learning, language learning tasks (1987) Lancaster Practical Papers In English Education, 7, pp. 5-21; Chin, C., Teacher questioning in science classrooms: Approaches that stimulate productive thinking (2007) Journal of Research In Science Teaching, 44 (2), pp. 815-843; Coffman, J., (2003) Higher Education In the Gulf: Privatization and Americanization, , http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/soe/cihe/newsletter/News33/text009.htm, [online].

Unfortunately, for several reasons, real laboratories are not always available. On the other hand, Internet technologies have proved to be mature and reliable, becoming a common alternative in the creation of remote laboratories. However, the use of these technologies in complex remote laboratories is not a trivial task as several requisites must be satisfied simultaneously. This article proposes a methodology that eases the creation of remote laboratories establishing the steps to build up a remote access system. This methodology proposes a set of key components that can be used to define the access to a remote plant from a functional point of view. Some of these components are generic being reusable in most applications whereas others are application specific. In summary, the methodology allows designers to concentrate more on the functionality of the applications than on the technical aspects of the underlying technology. The use of this methodology is illustrated with a relatively complex example: A laboratory manufacturing cell. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Computer-integrated manufacturing; Control education; Distributed computer control systems; Object modeling techniques; Remote laboratory","Application specific; Functional points; In-control; Internet technology; Key component; Key issues; Manufacturing cells; Object modeling; Remote access; Remote laboratories; Remote learning; Technical aspects; Complexation; Computer control; Computer control systems; Computer integrated manufacturing; Computer software reusability; Distributed computer systems; Engineering education; Flexible manufacturing systems; Laboratories; Distance education","Dormido, S., Control learning: Present and future (2004) Annu Rev Control, 28, pp. 115-0136; Antsakils, P., Basar, T., Decarlo, R., Harris, N., Spong, M., Yorkovich, S., Report on the NSF/CSS Workshop on new directions in control engineering education (1999) IEEE Control Syst Mag, 19, pp. 53-58; Poindexter, S.E., Heck, B.S., Using the web in your courses: What can you do?

When the number of precision points exceeds a certain number, most recent approaches utilize intelligent optimization methods based on too complex computer science theories to be implemented by an engineering student. In this article we develop and implement new mechanism design results, reducing simultaneously the design space to facilitate finding the optimal mechanism. Finally, we apply global optimization methods that do not require analytical expression of the objective function and are freely available for educational use with Matlab. The proposed computerized methodology focuses student motivation on the mechanical aspects of the problem.

Systems Engineering involves with finding integrated solutions to problems that are of large scale and scope, which are in the nature of cross and interdisciplinary. The article addresses to certain details, identity, and Systems Engineering program at Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey which consolidates IE, and ACE. CIM system can be considered as a typical Systems Engineering topic of concern since its hierarchical structure and sufficient complexity as well as being tangible and scalable for the purpose of education. CIM philosophy can be viewed as the peak of ongoing effort in the application of automation in the manufacturing and it encapsulates the total manufacturing enterprise through the use of integrated systems and data communications coupled with new managerial philosophies that improve organizational and personnel efficiency. The manufacturing of a simple toy car in the CIM lab is presented as a case study to demonstrate exploiting the concepts and notions given in the IE and ACE. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Computer integrated manufacturing; Education; Engineering; Systems; Systems engineering; Systems engineering education","Control engineering; Data-communication; Engineering systems; Hierarchical structures; Integrated solutions; Integrated systems; Istanbul , Turkey; Manufacturing enterprise; Scale and scope; Systems; Computer control systems; Computer integrated manufacturing; Engineering; Hierarchical systems; Philosophical aspects; Systems engineering; Toy manufacture; Engineering education","Bahill, A.T., Dean, F.F., What is Systems Engineering?

An undergraduate course at Georgia Institute of Technology introduces undergraduates to a systems-sustainability approach to civil and environmental engineering, applying systems methods to analyze decisions over the life cycle of large-scale civil-engineered facilities. This paper discusses voluntary and systematic improvements introduced in the course over a 2-year period to develop research and information skills in the students. A workshop on information sources and skills was developed, offered and assessed over multiple semesters using a team-based course project. The term project requires students to select one or two large-scale civil-engineered facilities, evaluate them using the integrated systems-sustainability framework presented in the course, and develop a written report and oral presentation to present their work to their peers at the end of the semester. The paper discusses integration of the information and library skills workshops with the course and presents results that underscore the importance of formally cultivating research and information skills in civil engineering undergraduate students. © 2010 ASCE.","Engineering education; Information management; Research; Students; Undergraduate study","Body of knowledge; Civil engineers; Georgia Institute of Technology; Information sources; Integrated systems; Oral presentations; Team-based; Undergraduate Courses; Undergraduate study; Civil engineering; Engineering education; Information management; Knowledge engineering; Research; Sustainable development; Teaching; Students","Amekudzi, A., Meyer, M., The civil engineering systems course at Georgia Institute of Technology (2004) Proc., 2004 Engineering Systems Symp., , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston; (1996) The Definition of Sustainable Development Adopted by the ASCE Board of Direction, , https://www.asce.org/inside/codeofethics.cfm, ASCE. 〈〉 (May 2008); (2007) The Vision of Civil Engineering in 2025, , ASCE; Civil engineering body of knowledge for the 21st century (2008) Preparing the Civil Engineer for the Future, , ASCE. 2nd Ed., ASCE, Reston, Va; http://www.aashe.org/index.php, Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). 〈〉 (May 2008); (2007) Information Literacy Standards for Science and Engineering/technology, , http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlstandards/infolitscitech.cfm, Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL). 〈〉 (May 2008); Bracke, M.S., Critz, L.J., Re-envisioning instruction for the electronic environment of a 21st century science-engineering library (2001) Sci.

While in some fields of engineering there are numerous industry-oriented problems that can be investigated reasonably thoroughly, and for which the pinnacle of formation is attained when a team of university students builds a working prototype, there are unfortunately few genuinely realistic conceive-design- build-test (operate) opportunities in which structural engineering students can participate actively during their formative years. This stems from the very nature of structural engineering itself which, as in the case of most civil engineering designs, usually calls for a unique solution to a problem of relatively large scale. One way to provide a realistic and significant structural engineering design opportunity is through student design competitions. However, the conditions of success for such a competition depend on the appropriate coincidence of interest between program goals, commitment from the owner of the structure to be designed and eventually built, and support, both financial and technical, from professional or research organizations. This case study reports on a recent structural engineering student design competition for a pedestrian walkway in Sherbrooke, Canada. It highlights the key technical features of the competition, the organizational obstacles, and the professional benefits for the participants. © 2010 ASCE.","Capstone Projects; Competitions; Design competitions; Design process; Infrastructure; Introduction to professional practice; Structural engineering; Training opportunities","Capstone Projects; Design competitions; Design process; Professional practices; Structural engineering; Behavioral research; Civil engineering; Competition; Professional aspects; Structural design; Students; Engineering education","Afhami, S., Kamel, A., Kuzik, M., Lacasse, C., (2002) Pedestrian Bridge Design-First ISIS Canada Student Design Competition, , Competition Re, Univ. of Alberta Team, ISIS Canada Internal Report ISIS-SDC-1-02-01; (2004) Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge for the 21st Century: Preparing the Civil Engineer for the Future, , ASCE, ASCE, Reston, Va; Banthia, V., Crocker, H., Klowak, C., Memon, A., Murison, S., (2002) The First ISIS Student Design Competition, , Re Prepared for Universit́ de Sherbrooke Pedestrian Bridge, Univ. of Manitoba Team, ISIS Canada Internal Report ISIS-SDC-1-02-02; Beaudoin, Y., Lamothe, P., Lapierre, P., Ràche, A., Passerelle pítonnìre couverte ̀ la Facult́ de ǵnie de l'Universit́ de Sherbrooke (2002) Dossier de Candidature de l'́Quipe de l'Universit́ de Sherbrooke, , ISIS Canada Internal Report ISIS-SDC-1-02-03; Bisby, L.A., El-Hacha, R., Ford, J., Tung, D., Williams, B., (2002) A-symmetry'-A Pedestrian Bridge for the Universit́ de Sherbrooke, , Preliminary Design Re No., Queen's Univ.

Unless BIM is introduced into undergraduate civil engineering curricula in a fundamental way, graduate civil engineers will lack the skills needed to serve a construction industry in which three-dimensional models are the main medium for expression and communication of design intent and the basis for engineering analysis. A mandatory freshman year course titled ""Communicating Engineering Information,"" which teaches both theoretical and practical aspects of BIM, has been developed to replace the traditional engineering graphics course at the Technion. The main lesson learned through four semesters of teaching the class is that students find BIM tools intuitive and therefore relatively easy to learn; the majority of lecture hours are now devoted to the conceptual aspects of BIM and the principles for preparing models that can be analyzed in multiple ways. BIM can and should be taught in its own right, and not as an extension to computer-aided drawing.

The Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Sheffield has explored service learning for the past three years. Previous research by Stukas et al had asked the question, service-learning: who benefits and why? They indicated that there are three main potential beneficiaries of this type of learning: the student, the institution and the community. However, they also argued that none of the potential benefits offered by service learning (learning enhancement, citizenship, fulfilment, employability, reputation, positive impact in the community, etc) is guaranteed and therefore, more research was needed to best determine the factors to achieve the goals and satisfaction of all. This paper looks at the use of service-learning in an engineering environment both in terms of embedding social awareness into the curriculum and looks at the issues surrounding the engagement of engineering students. The work discusses problems relating to the barriers for successful implementation as well as how service-learning can inspire the next generation of engineers and change the perception of engineering in the community. © 2009 E Rodriguez-Falcon and A Yoxall.",,"Engineers; Students; Engineering environment; Learning enhancements; Pedagogical method; Potential benefits; Service learning; Sheffield; Social awareness; Engineering education","Barnett, R., (1990) The Idea of Higher Education, , Buckingham, Open University Press; Bringle, R.G., Hatcher, J.A., Implementing service learning in higher education (1996) Journal of Higher Education, 67. , 1996; Dutson, A., Todd, R.H., Magleby, S.P., Sorensen, C.D., A review of literature on teaching engineering design (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86, pp. 17-28; Cohen, Jeremy, Kinsey, Denis, F., ""Doing good"" and scholarship: A service-learning study (1994) Journalism Educator, 48 (4), pp. 4-14; Dalley, J., Hamilton, B., Knowledge, context and learning in the small business (2000) International Small Business Journal, 18 (3), pp. 51-59; DeFillipi, R.J., Introduction: Project-based learning, reflective practices and learning outcomes (2001) Management Learning, 32 (1), pp. 5-10; Felder, R.M., Silverman, L.K., Learning and teaching styles in engineering education (1988) Engineering Education, 78 (7), pp. 674-681; Furco, A., (1996) Service-learning: A Balanced Approach to Experiential Education, Expanding Boundaries: Service and Learning, pp. 2-6. , Washington DC: Corporation for National Service, 1996; Handscombe, R.D., Rodriguez-Falcon, E.M., Patterson, E.A., Embedding enterprise in science and engineering departments (2008) Journal of Education and Training, 50 (7), pp. 615-625; Handscombe, R.D., Rodriguez-Falcon, E.M., Patterson, E.A., Embedding enterprise in engineering (2010) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education; Jones, C., Enterprise education: Learning through personal experience (2009) Industry and Higher Education, 23 (3), pp. 175-182; Kolb, D., (1984) Experiential Learning, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Kolb, D.A., The process of experiential learning (1993) Culture and Processes of Adult Learning, pp. 138-156. , M.

The term experience-led engineering degree came from the Sainsbury Review and is taken to mean components of an engineering degree that develop industry related skills and which may also include industry interaction. It presents the relevant findings from a study on how engineering degrees meet the needs of industry (Engineering graduates for industry). The study used a case study approach to address the research question: ""How can we enhance a sustainable world-class higher education engineering sector that meets the graduate recruitment needs of industry?"" Six case studies were developed that describe examples of experience-led components in engineering departments across England. A number of key messages emerged from the analysis of the case studies and this paper looks in detail at the drivers that lead to change within universities and discusses how these vary according to institutional missions and priorities. The case studies demonstrated examples of both wide-scale radical change and incremental small-scale change, with all cases showing the vital role played by learning and teaching champions in driving forward change at a departmental level and the importance of support from senior management. It is also recognised that responsibility for change must be shared between universities, industry and the funding bodies. Barriers to change have been identified and recommendations are made as to how change can be facilitated. © 2010 Carol Arlett, Fiona Lamb, Richard Dales, Liz Willis, Emma Hurdle.",,"Driver training; Students; Case study approach; Employability skills; Engineering department; Engineering graduates; Engineering sectors; Experience-led engineering degrees; Graduate recruitment; Learning and teachings; Engineering education","Arlett, C., Dales, R., (2008) Engage Project Report, , The Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire; Collins, K., Davies, J., Feedback through student essay competitions: What makes a good engineering lecturer?

This leads to the notion of discursive identity, which emphasises that students' identities are constituted through engaging in discourse. This view of learning implies that success in engineering studies needs to be defined with particular reference to the sorts of identities that students develop and how these relate to identities in the world of work. In order to achieve successful learning in engineering we need to recognise the multiple identities held by our students, provide an authentic range of engineering-related activities through which students can develop engineering identities and make more explicit key aspects of the discourse of engineering of which lecturers are tacitly aware. We include three vignettes to illustrate how some of the authors of this paper (from across three different institutions) have applied this perspective of learning in their teaching practice. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Discourse; Engineering education; Identity; Participation; Student learning",,"Ambrose, S.A., Amon, C.H., Systematic design of a first-year mechanical engineering course at Carnegie-Mellon University (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (2), pp. 173-181; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational psychology: A cognitive view., , New York: Holt; Brown, B.A., Reveles, J.M., Kelly, G.J., Scientific literacy and discursive identity: A theoretical framework for understanding science learning (2005) Science Education, 89 (5), pp. 779-802; Brown, D.E., (2000) Merging dynamics: An integrating perspective on learning, conceptual change, and teaching, and its implications for educational research.; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18 (1), pp. 32-42; Case, J., Kotta, L., Mogashana, D., Developing discursive identity and building community in first year chemical engineering (2007) For Engineering and Science Educators, pp. 8-9; Case, J.M., Jawitz, J., Ahmed, N., Smile nicely, make the tea—but will I ever be taken seriously?

Even if there is an excellent e-Learning system website, this will not automatically mean good learning results for learners using an online e-Learning environment. Consideration of the problem is made in this article by integrating the input-process-output concept into the system design phase, and uses an ontological engineering approach to build common domain knowledge before undertaking system design and development for an engineering education e-Learning system. © 2010 WIETE.",,"Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Engineering education; Ontology; Systems analysis; Websites; Domain knowledge; E-learning systems; Network communities; Online E-learning; Ontological engineering; System design and development; System designers; Learning systems","Bourdeau, J., Bates, A., Instructional design for distance learning (1996) J. of Science Educ. and Technol, 5 (4), pp. 267-283; McPherson, M., Nunes, M.B., Negotiating the Path from Curriculum Design to E-Learning Course Delivery: A Study of Critical Success Factors for Instructional Systems Design (2007), pp. 232-246. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science Creating New Learning Experiences on a Global Scale; Hanna, M.D., Newman, R.W., (2001) Integrated Operations Management Adding Value for Customer, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc; Finch, B.J., (2008) Operations Now - Supply Chain Profitability and Performance, , (3rd Edn), Mcgraw-Hill; Chen, C.-Y., Lo, W.-S., An agent e-Learning system for interactive and collaborative communication (2004) WSEAS Transactions on Computer, 3 (4), pp. 1013-1017; Chen, C.-Y., Lo, W.-S., An open learning community for agent e-Learning system (2004) Proc.

A questionnaire of 37 items with normal scaling was applied. Using factor analysis, the construct of competence was collected for five areas, including: learning attitudes, study habits, learning methods, resources application and learning self-review. The higher constructs of effective learning ability were learning attitude, learning methods and learning self-review; however, study habits and resources application scored lowest for studentlearning abilities. Students, who were culinary certified, had significantly higher scores in learning methods. Regression analysis showed that learning attitudes and study habits were positive constructs, but other constructs were unrelated to learning satisfaction. © 2010 WIETE.",,"Beverages; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Students; Effective learning; Learning attitudes; Learning methods; Learning satisfactions; Study habits; Engineering education","Teng, C.C., The effects of personality traits and attitudes on student uptake in hospitality employment (2008) Inter.

Yet despite its significant educational values, it is not deemed necessary to attain a high degree of success in the education system, and the decline of technology education in Hong Kong has explicated the issue. Even though technology education in Hong Kong is no longer a skill-based subject, it seems that some policymakers and school administrators do not treasure the values of technology education. In this paper, the reasons for the failure of technology education in Hong Kong are suggested. Possible recommendations and suggestions are provided in redeveloping technology education. The experience of technology education in Hong Kong is an integral part of the entire curriculum development process, and its future largely depends on how educators and researchers interfere with the education system.

The two courses, while at a similar level of technical difficulty, were delivered using different teaching methods: one with traditional delivery and one with more elements of intentional learning. Apart from regular evaluations and student feedback, small group analyses were also used to compare various aspects of the teaching and learning experience. It was confirmed from the study that the students were more receptive to the teaching methods that incorporate intentional learning elements. Student perception of learning also scored higher for the teaching method that implemented more intentional learning elements. A clear correlation was also found between students' classroom activeness and the final grades, when more intentional learning elements were employed. Such correlation tended to disappear with the traditional teaching. © 2010 WIETE.",,"Students; Teaching; Core engineering; Group analysis; Learning in engineering; Student feedback; Student perceptions; Teaching and learning; Teaching methods; Technical difficulties; Engineering education","Bereiter, C., Scardamalia, M., (1989) Intentional learning as a goal of instruction, , http://ikit.org/fulltext/1989intentional.pdf; Bruning, R., The College Classroom from the Perspective of Cognitive Psychology.

They can also provide immersive environments where advanced users can practice knowledge and skills, also exploiting multimodal interaction. They can combine the effectiveness of computer processing and data storage, with high levels of attractiveness. Our work has investigated the state of the art research on SGs, starting from the cognitive aspects, that are necessary in order to root technological development and applications in sound theoretical foundations. The paper discusses some key aspects about SG design and exploitation: choice of components-off-the-shelf or from-scratch design, tools and methodologies for development or adaptation, intelligent tutoring, virtual coaches and affective learning, living worlds, game mechanics, Human-Computer Interaction. While several SGs have been developed, still the literature stresses a lack of significant, extensive user tests. Further research is necessary to investigate in greater detail the real effectiveness of the various types of SGs. The paper proposes several research questions - that range from requirements elicitation to design and from deployment to use and evaluation - to be answered in order to avoid technology pushing and drive technological research according to the requirements of the end-users and stakeholders. We believe that deepening the analysis about these issues is key to strengthen the foundations of SG research, for which we identify four major directions: definition of metrics and learning progress evaluation tools; methodologies and tools for designing games from various topics and for various users; computing and communication architectures; technologies that can enhance the overall system performance.","Cognitive load theory; Human-computer interaction; Intelligent tutoring; Serious games; Simulation; Virtual reality","Computation theory; Data handling; Digital storage; Education computing; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Virtual reality; Cognitive load theory; Communication architectures; Components off the shelves; Intelligent tutoring; Multi-Modal Interactions; Requirements elicitation; Simulation; Technological development; Serious games","Prensky, M., (2000) Digital game-based learning, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Yessad, A., Labat, J.-M., Kermorvant, F., SeGAE: A Serious Game Authoring Environment (2010) 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies; Greitzer, F.L., Kuchar, O.A., Huston, K., Cognitive Science Implications for Enhancing Training Effectiveness in a Serious Gaming Context (2007) ACM J.

In Nigeria, GSM means Telecom Explosion. The GSM revolution began in August 2001 and changed the face of Information and Communications Technology in Nigeria. It is much easier to reach anybody that you have his/her number, whether they are in the village or in their closet unless in a place where there is no network of the service provider. As revolutionary as GSM may seem to be, its negative effect on our educational sector is of great concern. The ongoing war against examination malpractice is yet to take its toll on perpetrators as they have devised a new method to continue their game through the cell phone technology. Described as e-cheating, the cell phone technology is providing students a smart way to beat the best effort of stakeholders to stamp out the menace. This paper examines GSM technology, the various ways in which cell phones are employed to cheat and suggestions on how to stop e-cheating through cell phones.","E-cheating; Emerging communication technology; Examination malpractice; GSM services","Cellular telephones; Best effort; Communication technologies; Education sectors; Educational sectors; Examination malpractice; Information and communications technology; Service provider; Technological advancement; Engineering education","Sunday, A., Ogidigbo, D., Bassey, R., The Plague of Examination Malpractice (Unpublished), , http://www.weekly.dailytrust.com/index.php?, (April 16, 2010); Felix, A., Should Children Have Cell Phones at School?, , www.helium.com/.../92065; Selian, A., 3G Mobile Licensing Policy: From GSM to IMT-2000-A Comparative Analysis, , http://www.itu.int/3g; Lynne, B., Fair Cell PhoneUse in Schools, , www.suite101.com/content/fair-cell-phone-useinschools-a-15906, (March 11, 2007), Pros and Cons of Cell Phones in School; Smithe, B., The Disadvantages of Letting Students Use Their Cell Phones at School, , www.associatedcontent.com/, (September 05, 2008); Kinder, C.N., The Physics of Cell Phones, , http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/2003/4/03.04.07.x.html; Darwin, L.K., Carl, J.C., e-CHEATING: Are Students misusing it?

Employers from 30 engineering-focused organisations were interviewed to solicit their views on their expectations and willingness to employ graduates with engineering dual degrees. The employers' organisations ranged from small to large engineering firms. Respondents indicated that recruiters are more concerned about graduates' engineering skills and academic results than whether the graduates had a single or a dual degree. However employers also indicated that they viewed dual degrees as equipping graduates with a broader skill set that could be valuable to the organisation over the longer term. Employers indicated that whereas graduates were expected to focus on engineering tasks over the first few years of their employment, a dual qualification, particularly engineering-business, could lead to a dual degree graduate being promoted more rapidly. © 2010 WIETE.",,"Engineering; Dual-degrees; Engineering firms; Engineering skills; Engineering tasks; Learning and teachings; Skill sets; Engineering education","Johnson, P., (1996) Changing the culture, , Final Report, Review of Engineering Education.

In order to improve the engineering education, a pedagogical method that involves project-based learning, using computational fl uid dynamics (CFD), was applied. The project-based learning works well for mechanical engineering education, since it prepares students for their later professional training. The courses combined applied and advanced concepts of fluid mechanics with the basic numerical aspects of CFD, including validation of the results obtained. In this approach, the physical understanding of practical problems of fl uid mechanics and heat transfer played an important role. Satisfactory numerical results were obtained by using both Phoenics and Fluent finite-volume codes. Some cases were solved using the well known Matlab software. Comparisons were made between the results obtained by analytical solutions (if any) with those reached by CFD general-purpose codes and with those obtained by Matlab. This system provides engineering students with a solid comprehension of several aspects of thermal and fluids engineering.","Applied and selected topics; Computational fluid dynamics; Project-based learning; Thermal and fluid engineering","Computational fluid dynamics; Fluid mechanics; Heat transfer; MATLAB; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Thermal Engineering; Dynamics; Education; Engineering education; Fluid dynamics; Mechanics; Applied and selected topics; Finite volume code; Fluid engineering; Heat transfer course; Pedagogical method; Practical problems; Professional training; Project based learning; applied and selected topics; Engineering education; Computational fluid dynamics","Gad-El-Hak, M., Fluid mechanics from the beginning to the third millennium (1998) Int.

Moreover, it can be implemented on large networks and can be used either as an exhaustive BE or as a heuristic BE.

The shortage of quality faculty is currently acknowledged as the most critical problem and finding enough competent and qualified faculties is becoming a growing challenge for engineering institutions, as they have to compete with their counterparts in India and abroad, in curriculum and teaching standards. A synoptic view of the main factors behind the shortage, its impacts in the quality of education and strategies required for maintaining quality and balancing the demand and supply of teaching faculty in technical institutions are delved in this paper. The analysis also highlights the core competency of engineering teachers, the present scenario of teaching faculty, the state-wise magnitude of shortage and the educational profile of teaching faculty at all-India level. The research gives a national perspective on the problem and adds further investigation into various facets and illuminates its impacts on the quality of education.

One of the main reasons for this situation is the lack of teachers' knowledge and skills in their role as 'gatekeepers' for the integration of new aspects in the teachings (Pelgrum, 2001; Goodwin and Oyler, 2008). Academic staff needs to acquire competences concerning digital technologies as well as pedagogical competences to renew university teachings. Due to the fact that the enhancement of competences is a lifelong learning process and because of the permanent development of educational technologies, there will always be a need for professional staff development programmes that enable long-term learning processes. This paper explores important aspects of competencyoriented qualification programmes for academic staff and it is focused on the cooperation between members of different faculties as a basis for successful staff development with sustainable effects.

It reports on the E-Competence Agency and its concept of demand-driven facetoface consulting to win lecturers to e-learning and other e-services provided by the central service units, the role of the strategic learning platform Moodle, e-learning in the broader context of the development of seamlessly integrated digital support for the value-chain of the University and the key factors of success for e-competence. In its concluding part, the paper presents an outlook on present and future challenges for e-competence such as the changing understanding of e-learning as a 'natural dimension' of teaching and learning, and of e-competence in the overall IT strategy of the University.

The willingness and readiness of teachers to take up new approaches has always been one of the determining factors. Past literature suggests that both technical and pedagogical challenges can hinder teachers' uptake of innovations. The paper describes an institutional framework and set of strategies devised at The Chinese University of Hong Kong to support teachers' use of e-learning technologies. The strategies focus on technical and pedagogical skills, and levels of motivation. The actual strategies implemented include workshops and seminars, online resources, easy-to-use learning management platforms, peer support, building support from senior management and research findings about new strategies in the local context. Our approach and framework should be of relevance to universities which have similar backgrounds, concerns and needs.

Several adaptable models are presented, including: 'personal tutor monologue' recorded at the PC by the tutor as part of the marking process; 'personal feedback conversations', recorded by the tutor or student(s) in the lab or studio to capture project discussions or studio 'crits'; 'broadcast feedback' targeted at large groups; 'peer audio feedback', in which students learn as they assess each other's work; 'tutor conversations', a 'common room conversation' approach designed to model critical thinking; and 'personal audio interventions', targeted at individuals to address emerging issues. The methods are introduced and evaluated according to their potential to formatively affect learning. Audio feedback design factors are outlined and practical recommendations are offered. The paper concludes that the use of audio feedback can promote a culture of dialogic engagement.

This paper describes an indirect approach to improving feedback for learners - training the feedback-giver while actually preparing the feedback for the learners. Specifically, the aim is to help inexperienced teaching assistants (TAs) who lack training in how to provide quality feedback. The approach emphasises the ways in which feedback is organised through the use of feedback patterns. There is evidence that students in higher education, like adult learners, require improved feedback to make their learning more efficient. McFeSPA (metacognitive feedback scaffolding system for pedagogical apprenticeship) was designed and implemented as efeedback to help improve the TAs' feedback skills while marking programming assignments - and then evaluated to determine whether TAs could benefit from automated feedback. The evaluation involves examining the system with scaffolding turned off to help three TAs give feedback to a group of students and scaffolding turned on for three TAs using the full system. The results are broadly favourable.

Accomplishing such change first requires understanding why students choose to pursue engineering degrees. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) Framed in motivation theory, our purpose was to better understand how students choose engineering by answering the question: How do engineering students' engineering-related value beliefs contribute to their choices to engage and persist in earning engineering degrees? DESIGN/METHOD This research uses Eccles' expectancy-value theory in a qualitative, longitudinal examination of undergraduate students' choices to enroll and persist in engineering majors. In particular, the focus of this work is Eccles' subjective task value (STV) construct, which incorporates the personal importance an individual assigns to engaging in an activity. Using a multiple case study method approach, participants included eleven students (five men and six women) at a U.S. technical school. RESULTS Results demonstrate that different patterns exist in the types of value or personal importance that participants assign to earning an engineering degree. Moreover, a primary differentiating feature of these patterns is whether or not participants choose engineering because it is consistent with their personal identity or sense of self. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that values are very important in students' choices to become engineers. To increase persistence rates we must focus on values, especially by helping students connect their personal identities to engineering identities.","Expectancy-value theory; Identity; Motivation","Education; Engineering education; Motivation; Engineering degrees; Engineering graduates; Expectancy-value theory; Identity; Motivation theories; Multiple-case study; Personal identity; Undergraduate students; Students","Alias, M., Hafir, N., The relationship between academic selfconfidence and cognitive performance among engineering students (2009) Proceedings of the Research in Engineering Education Symposium (REES), , Palm Cove, Australia; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , New York: W.H.

This study builds on the literature and focuses on the experiences of a cohort of students who aimed to complete their undergraduate work in 2007. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This paper presents the outcomes of the longitudinal administration of the Persistence in Engineering survey. The goal was to identify correlates of persistence in undergraduate engineering education and professional engineering practice. DESIGN/METHOD The survey was administered seven times over four years to a cohort of students who had expressed interest in studying engineering. At the end of the study, the participants were categorized as persisters or non-persisters. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used, in conjunction with other approaches, to test for differences between the groups. RESULTS Persisters and non-persisters did not differ significantly according to the majority of the constructs. Nevertheless, parental and high school mentor influences as a motivation to study engineering, as well as confidence in math and science skills, were identified as correlates of persistence. Intention to complete an engineering major was also a correlate of persistence; it appears to decline sharply at least two semesters prior to students leaving engineering. The findings also suggest that there might be differences among non-persisters when they are further grouped by when they leave engineering. CONCLUSIONS Facilitating higher levels of mentor involvement before college might increase student motivation to study engineering, and also constitute a mechanism for fostering confidence in math and science skills. Since the intention to complete an engineering degree decreases well before students act, there may be opportunities for institutions to develop targeted interventions for students, and help them make informed decisions.","Longitudinal study; Persistence; Retention","Education; Engineering education; Motivation; Surveys; Engineering degrees; Longitudinal study; Persistence; Persistence in engineerings; Professional engineerings; Retention; Student motivation; Undergraduate engineering educations; Students","Adelman, C., (1998) Women and Men of the Engineering Path: A Model for Analyses of Undergraduate Careers, , Research Report (143) 0-16-049551-2.

PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) The primary purpose was to develop a statistically reliable survey instrument to document teachers' beliefs and expectations about pre-college engineering instruction, college preparation, and career success in engineering, called the Engineering Education Beliefs and Expectations Instrument (EEBEI), and to compare teachers' views. DESIGN/METHOD Using two samples of teachers, EEBEI was established as a statistically reliable survey and was used to examine the beliefs and expectations of Project Lead the Way (PLTW) and non-PLTW teachers. The results were used to further examine teachers' decisions in advising fictional students (described in vignettes) with varying academic and socioeconomic profiles. RESULTS High school STEM teachers report their instruction was influenced by students' interests, family background, and prior academic achievement. Comparisons between PLTW and non-PLTW teachers revealed that non-PLTW teachers agreed more strongly that an engineer must demonstrate high scholastic achievement in math and science whereas PLTW teachers were more likely to report that science and math content was integrated into engineering activities. Although teachers report that students' socioeconomic status was not influential when asked explicitly, it did influence situated decision-making tasks using fictional student vignettes. CONCLUSIONS Findings address challenges of STEM integration and reveal conflicting purposes of K-12 engineering education as being for a select few or to promote technological literacy for all students, which affects recruitment, instruction, and assessment practices.","K-12 engineering education; STEM; Teacher beliefs","Decision making; Education; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Academic achievements; Assessment practices; Engineering activities; Engineering instructions; K-12 engineering education; Socio-economic status; Teacher beliefs; Technological literacy; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)","Anderson, K.J.B., Courter, S.S., Nathans-Kelly, T., Nicometo, C., McGlamery, T., Understanding the current work and values of professional engineers: Implications for engineering education (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 American Society of Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Austin, TX; Ball, D.L., Unlearning to teach mathematics (1988) For the Learning of Mathematics, 8 (1), pp. 40-48; Ball, D.L., Teacher learning and the mathematics reforms: What we think we know and what we need to learn (1996) Phi Delta Kappan, 77 (7), pp. 500-508; Battista, M.T., Teacher beliefs and the reform movement of mathematics education (1994) Phi Delta Kappan, 75 (6), pp. 462-470; Benner, A.D., Mistry, R.S., Congruence of mother and teacher educational expectations and low-income youth's academic competence (2007) Journal of Educational Psychology, 99 (1), pp. 140-153; Black, T.R., (1999) Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design, Measurement, and Statistics, , London: Sage Publications; Borko, H., Eisenhart, M., Brown, C.A., Underhill, R.G., Jones, D., Agard, P.C., Learning to teach hard mathematics-Do novice teachers and their instructors give up too easily?

PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) We explored three research questions: How do engineering students rate their college engagement compared to students in other majors? How do engineering persisters, non-persisters, and migrators compare in terms of collegiate engagement, time on task, and enriching educational experiences? What college engagement factors predict persistence in engineering? DESIGN/METHOD Data are from nearly 12,000 students who completed the NSSE survey in their first and senior years as undergraduates. Surveys were analyzed using ANOVA and Chi-square calculations to determine whether differences emerged in three dimensions of student engagement based on students' self-reported major. Due to the large sample, effect size was used to determine statistical significance. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors that predict persistence among first year students and seniors in engineering. RESULTS Results show that engineering majors are similar to non-engineering majors on most variables. However, engineering majors reported significantly higher gains in practical competence and higher order thinking, but the lowest means on reflective learning and gains in general education. Engineering majors reported significantly more time preparing for class and less time participating in educationally enriching experiences. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that different educational outcomes between majors are the result of programmatic differences. The packed engineering curriculum requires students to make trade-offs between gaining practical/marketable skills and participating in educationally enriching activities. We question this trade-off and suggest alternative approaches.","Persistence; Student engagement; Undergraduate major","Concentration (process); Economic and social effects; Education; Engineering education; Surveys; Binary logistic regression; Educational experiences; Higher-order thinkings; Persistence; Persistence in engineerings; Statistical significance; Student engagement; Undergraduate major; Students","Adelman, C., (1998) Women and Men of the Engineering Path: A Model for Analyses of Academic Careers, , Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education; (2007) Bachelor of Arts in Engineering Website, , http://www.sie.arizona.edu/BAE/info.html, Arizona Board of Regents, (last accessed, August 2010); Astin, A.W., The methodology of research on college impact (1970) Sociology of Education, 43, pp. 223-254; Astin, A.W., (1993) What Matters in College?

To provide a successful learning experience for students engaged in writing activities, timely feedback is necessary. Providing this feedback to increasing numbers of students poses a major challenge for instructors. New automated systems work towards providing both timely and appropriate writing feedback, but students' views on automated feedback, and feedback in general, are not well understood. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) To contribute to a deeper understanding of students' conceptions of feedback from tutors and an automated system called Glosser, and how these conceptions are related to achievement.

The design of the study involves in-depth interviews and the analysis employs an approach in which student conceptions of automated feedback are investigated in relation to related feedback from their tutor, perceptions of automated feedback in general, and their academic achievement. RESULTS Students' conceptions of feedback vary and can be grouped into cohesive and fragmented, which is consistent with other theoretical models. Close associations were found between more cohesive conceptions of feedback and better academic performance. CONCLUSIONS A student's conception of traditional and automated feedback is similar, being either cohesive or fragmented. Changing one may change the other. Deep learners see feedback as a way of learning about the topic whereas shallow learners see them as a way to improve the communication aspects of writing. Design considerations based on these results are discussed.","Automated feedback; Phenomenography; Professional writing","Automation; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students; Teaching; Academic achievements; Academic performance; Automated feedback; Design considerations; Engineering graduates; In-depth interviews; Learning experiences; Phenomenography; Education computing","Andeweg, B.A., De Jong, J.C., Helpviewer or textbook?

Students have shown favourable responses to podcasts and some universities now offer formal podcasting initiatives or programs to assist faculty in using the technology. As podcasting is becoming more popular, there is a need to accurately assess the educational potential of the technology and develop effective strategies for supporting a podcast community. This article explores recent developments in podcasting, reports on a recent survey of 137 US students' perceptions of the technology and describes existing support services for podcasting in 50 US universities.

Little is known about the usability of eBooks for academic reading. At The Chinese University of Hong Kong, a pilot study by five trained reviewers was carried out to investigate the readiness of the technology in terms of how usable and functional the current software is. Key functions were examined, including book organisation, search tool, orientation clues, customisation, bookmarking, highlighting and annotating, ease of reading, reading history and eBook management. Four eBook readers were reviewed: Adobe Reader, Microsoft Reader, eReader and Mobipocket Reader. The authors concluded that the readers exhibited all these functionalities but in varying degrees. Whilst there is considerable potential, there are significant challenges in the technology itself and the approaches needed in the pre-reading process; these will need to be overcome before users will adopt the technology.

A complicating factor is that regular education needs to revise its main paradigm. It is hard to find solid reference beacons for deciding who is changing most: school-based education or life-long learning for adults. Regular education seems to evolve from a transfer into a developmental paradigm. Life-long learning tends to migrate from 'incidental-' and 'continuous learning' into 'course-based-', 'institutionalised-' and 'certificate-driven' learning. Its mutual comparison is like estimating the speed of two opposing trains without seeing the landscape.

Learning is one of the crucial fields of activity that have benefited from such technological development. During the last decade, integration of ICT gave birth to what is now called E-learning. The trend towards mobile technologies led to Mlearning at the beginning of the current decade. The happening of these two learning environments has raised several research interrogations that revolve around the need to tap the progress by each one of these two environments for the benefit of the other. Our research group deals with this issue too. Coexistence between E and M learning has brought about the need for interoperability, which involves maximum use of technological breakthroughs in both environments and makes it, therefore, possible to build up an educational heritage, regardless of the technological learning tools used. We try to present our approach to create an E&M learning continuum. © 2010 IEEE.","Adapting standards; E-learning; IMS LD; Interoperability; M-learning; Madar learning; Mobile technologies; Modular architecture; Pedagogy; Standard","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Interoperability; Standards; Telecommunication equipment; IMS LD; M-Learning; Madar learning; Mobile Technology; Modular architectures; Pedagogy; Engineering education","Touzi, J., (2007) Aide À la Conception de Système D'Information Collaboratif Support de L'interopérabilité des Entreprises., , Toulouse : Institut national polytechnique de Toulouse; Daoudi, N., Ajhoun, R., An adaptation, of e-learning standards to mlearning (2008) International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (IJIM), 2 (3); Daoudi, N., Ebobisse Djene, Y., Ajhoun, R., Environnement de développement applications hybrides: PCs et Mobiles (2008) Wngn'08: 1er Workshop sur les Nouvelles Géné rations de Réseaux: la Mobilité., , Fès.

Some studies that examine graduate engineering education suggest that students are experiencing educational deficiencies that can affect the research experience. Thus, exploring engineering graduate student research proficiency is warranted. Purpose: (HYPOTHESIS) This work begins to earnestly answer the research questions ""How proficient are engineering graduate students in research?"" and ""What factors affect the research proficiency of these students?"" DESIGN/METHOD: In order to answer the two research questions specifically for the Georgia Institute of Technology Environmental Engineering graduate program, current students in the program participated in two surveys. Survey questions were designed to measure students' perceptions of their research proficiency and to aid in determining student academic motivations tied to proficiency. Results: Many students indicated that they lacked research preparation upon beginning graduate study and during the first year of study, lacked development in important research skills like statistics and communicating in writing, and were somewhat hindered in research organization and progress. Regarding academic motivations, students generally valued personal advancement and enrichment over paper publication. Doctoral students overall indicated more preparation with respect to several aspects of research and more value placed on paper publication than did master's students. Conclusions: The surveys provided important findings regarding student research proficiency for the engineering graduate program in question. These findings encourage the exploration of engineering graduate student research proficiency on a broader scale in future studies.","Graduate studies; Research proficiency; Surveys","Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Environmental technology; Motivation; Surveying; Surveys; Academic motivations; Engineering graduate programs; Engineering graduate students; Exploring Engineering; Georgia Institute of Technology; Graduate studies; Research organization; Research proficiencies; Students","(2007) Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs: Effective for Evaluations during the 2008-2009 Accreditation Cycle, , ABET Engineering Accreditation Commission.

Purpose: (HYPOTHESIS) This study uses an integrated model leveraging the strengths of multiple statistical techniques to analyze the educational process from pre-high school through college and predict which students will achieve a STEM education. DESIGN/METHOD: The probability of earning a STEM degree is modeled using variables available as of the eighth grade as well as standardized test scores from high school. These include demographic, attitudinal, experiential, and academic performance measures derived from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) dataset. The integrated model combines logistic regression, survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis to predict whether an individual is likely to obtain a STEM degree. Results: Predicted results of the integrated model were compared to actual outcomes and those of a separate logistic regression model. The modeling process identified a set of significant predictive variables and achieved very good predictive accuracy. The integrated model and logistic regression model performed with comparable precision. Conclusions: The modeling process was adept at identifying STEM students and a large pool of other degree students that might have been capable of pursuing a STEM degree. The results suggest that it is quite feasible to identify good STEM candidates for a pro-STEM intervention to engage their interest in STEM and support stronger quantitative skill development.","Integrated logistic regression modeling; NELS:88 longitudinal study; STEM persistence","Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Students; Academic performance; Integrated logistic regression modeling; Logistic Regression modeling; Nels:88 longitudinal studies; Predictive variables; Receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC); Statistical techniques; Stem persistences; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)","Adelman, C., Women and men of the engineering path: A model for analyses of undergraduate careers (1998) PLLI, pp. 98-8055. , U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, Washington, DC: Government Printing Office; Allison Paul, D., (1995) Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide.

While many researchers provide descriptions and suggestions that engagement is crucial to learning, there is no widespread, standard definition for engagement to guide engineering educators. Purpose: (HYPOTHESIS) The purpose of this study is to begin to understand student engagement by examining how students and faculty viewed the term engagement as it relates to their engineering courses. The two key questions asked were (1) How do faculty and undergraduate students define engagement? and (2) How are their definitions similar or different? DESIGN/METHOD: This exploratory study included a survey of all engineering faculty teaching first- and second-year students and first- and second-year engineering undergraduates enrolled in any engineering course within the standard curriculum at a small engineering school. Results: Students view engagement in terms of faculty enthusiasm for the subject and in teaching and the availability of faculty for out-of-class interactions. Faculty members believe that engagement rests with the students. Conclusions: This study suggests that there is not a single definition of engagement for engineering students. Rather, engagement is both a process and an outcome. Faculty stimulate engagement by providing students with active learning experiences, conveying excitement and enthusiasm for their subject, and providing opportunities for student-faculty interactions. Students show their engagement by participating in class discussions, doing research projects, and interacting with their professors and peers.","Engagement; Freshmen programs; Undergraduate engineering education","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Teaching; Technical presentations; Engagement; Engineering educators; Engineering undergraduates; Freshmen programs; Standard definitions; Undergraduate engineering educations; Undergraduate engineering students; Undergraduate students; Students","Akera, A., (2005) Education Simulation and Pedagogies of Engagement, , www.rpi.edu/~akeraa/prometheans/education/ihss1975/4spresentation.ppt, Last accessed, August 2009; Allen, D., Tanner, K., Infusing active learning into the largeenrollment biology class: Seven strategies, from the simple to complex (2005) Cell Biology Education, 4 (4), pp. 262-268; Belcheir, M., The national survey of student engagement: Results from Boise State freshmen and seniors (2004) Boise State University Research Report, pp. 2000-2004; Bjorkland, S., Fortenberry, N., Measuring student and faculty engagement in engineering education (2005) CASEE Report 5902001-2005-0705, , Washington, DC: National Academy of Engineering; Bjorkland, S., Fortenberry, N., Work in progress-developing national survey instruments to assess engagement in best instructional practices and attainment of targeted student outcomes (2005) Proceedings of the 35th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, , Indianapolis, IN; Bonous-Hammarth, M., Pathways to success: Affirming opportunities for science, mathematics, and engineering majors (2000) Journal of Negro Education, 69 (1-2), pp. 92-111; Brainard, S., Carlin, L., A six-year longitudinal study of undergraduate women in engineering and science (1997) Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of Frontiers in Education: Teaching and Learning in An Era of Change, , Pittsburgh, PA; Capie, W., Tobin, K.G., Pupil engagement in learning tasks: A fertile area for research in science teaching (1981) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 18 (5), pp. 409-417; Carini, R.M., Hayek, J.C., Kuh, G.D., Kennedy, J.M., Ouimet, J.A., College student responses to web and paper surveys: Does mode matter?

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SBL on learners' motivation and performance. In assessing students' motivation, we adopted a framework based on the Self-determination Theory (SDT), chosen on account of its comprehensive treatment of the relationship between students' perceived needs satisfaction and their motivation. Purpose: (HYPOTHESIS) It is hypothesized that SBL, which provides learners with interactive learning experiences, will enhance students' motivation and performance. We explored the effect of SBL on students' perceived psychological needs satisfaction, motivation, and learning, and how SBL affected students' understanding and application of content knowledge. DESIGN/METHOD: The intervention procedure involved the incorporation of SBL in Machining Technology, a 60 hour module in the mechanical engineering program. Survey findings and post-intervention assessment outcomes were used to assess the students' perceptions of their basic psychological needs satisfaction, motivation, and performance. Results: Our findings suggest that the students perceived their psychological needs to be satisfied and had high levels of self-determined motivation. Students who undertook SBL had higher mean performance test scores, although SBL may have differential effects on learners depending on factors such as gender, educational backgrounds, and IT knowledge. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the students perceived their basic psychological needs to be met and that SBL can potentially enhance self-determined motivation as well as improve learning in general.","Motivation; Self-determination theory; Simulation-based learning","Education; Learning systems; Machining; Motivation; Students; Differential effect; Interactive learning; Machining technology; Mechanical engineering program; Motivation and performance; School of engineering; Self-determination theories; Simulation-based learning; Engineering education","Abrahamson, S., Denson, J.S., Wolf, R.M., Effectiveness of simulator in training anesthesiology residents (2004) Quality and Safety in Health Care, 13 (5), pp. 395-397; Agnew, D.M., Shin, G.G., Effects of simulation on cognitive achievement in agricultural mechanics (1990) Journal of Agricultural Education, 31 (2), pp. 12-16; Anderson, L., Gilbride, K., The future of engineering: A study of the gender bias (2007) McGill Journal of Education, 42 (1), pp. 103-117; Ang, S.L., Gender differentials in fields of study among graduates (2006) Statistics Singapore Newsletter, , http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/ssn/archive/ssnsep2006.pdf, (September) Singapore Department of Statistics (last accessed, March 2010); Balamuralithara, B., Woods, P.C., Virtual laboratories in engineering education: The simulation lab and remote lab (2009) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 17 (3), pp. 108-118; Bandura, A., Barbaranelli, C., Caprara, G.V., Pastorelli, C., Multifaceted impact of self-efficacy beliefs on academic functioning (1996) Child Development, 67 (3), pp. 1206-1222; Black, A.E., Deci, E.L., The effects of instructors' autonomy support and students' autonomous motivation on learning organic chemistry: A self-determination theory perspective (2000) Science Education, 84 (6), pp. 740-756; Carlsen, D.D., Andre, T., Use of a microcomputer simulation and conceptual change text to overcome student preconceptions about electric circuits (1992) Journal of Computer-Based Instruction, 19 (4), pp. 105-109; Carrington, K., Pratt, A., How far have we come?

Diffusion of innovations theory is used to better understand this phenomenon. Purpose: (HYPOTHESIS) Research questions include: How widespread is awareness and adoption of established engineering education innovations? Are there differences by discipline or institutional type? How do engineering department chairs find out about engineering education innovations? What factors do engineering department chairs cite as important in adoption decisions? DESIGN/METHOD: U.S. engineering department chairs were surveyed regarding their awareness and department use of seven engineering education innovations. One hundred ninety-seven usable responses are presented primarily as categorical data with Chi square tests where relevant. Results: Overall, the awareness rate was 82 percent, while the adoption rate was 47 percent. Eighty-two percent of engineering departments employ studentactive pedagogies (the highest). Mechanical and civil engineering had the highest rates, in part due to many design-related innovations in the survey. Few differences by institution type were evident. In the past, word of mouth and presentations were far more effective than publications in alerting department chairs to the innovations. Department chairs cited financial resources, faculty time and attitudes, and student satisfaction and learning as major considerations in adoption decisions. Conclusions: The importance of disciplinary networks was evident during survey administration and in the results. Specific recommendations are offered to employ these networks and the engineering professional societies for future engineering education improvement efforts.","Change; Diffusion of innovations; Faculty development","Diffusion; Education; Statistical tests; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Change; Diffusion of innovations; Diffusion of innovations theories; Engineering department; Engineering education innovations; Engineering professionals; Faculty development; Student satisfaction; Engineering education","Agogino, A.M., Sheppard, S., Oladipupo, A., Making connections to engineering during the first two years (1992) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Nashville, TN; Amadei, B., Program in engineering for developing communities viewing the developing world as the classroom of the 21st century (2003) Proceedings of the Frontiers in Education Conference, , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber_1264725, Boulder, CO.

A retrospective survey was administered to classes of sophomores and juniors. The survey was focused on impressions of the first-year engineering experiences motivated by a desire to assess the new program. This assessment was used to address research questions relating to students' comfort approaching faculty/upperclass students and transition. The survey was first administered during January 2006, prior to program introduction, and again in January 2008, after the program was in place for two years. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression models for statistically significant differences. Findings indicate: (1) students are more comfortable approaching upperclass students than faculty for advice in many situations, (2) no measurable student benefit could be concluded as a result of the mentoring program introduction, (3) gender differences exist in terms of a student's comfort with their decision to stay in engineering, and (4) gender was not a statistically significant factor in predicting adjustment to engineering. Results support continued focus on increasing academic confidence in women and men entering engineering programs to support the adjustment to engineering. The affinity of students for obtaining advice from more experienced students rather than faculty suggests that support programs such as mentoring should aide that adjustment, yet it is clear that the success of such programs is sensitive to conditions that are not easily controlled. © 2010.","First-year engineering; Gender; Mentoring","Education; Professional aspects; Regression analysis; Students; Surveys; Descriptive statistics; First-year engineering; First-year engineering experience; Gender; Mentoring; Retrospective surveys; Statistically significant difference; University of Notre Dame; Engineering education","Agresti, A., Finlay, B., (1997) Statistical methods for the social sciences 3rd ed, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Arefi, M., Revisiting the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative (LANI): Lessons for planners (2003) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 22 (4), pp. 384-399. , DOI 10.1177/0739456X03022004005; Armstrong, J., Allinson, C.W., Hayes, J., Formal mentoring vsystems: An examination of the effects of mentor/protege styles on the mentoring process (2002) Journal f Management Studies, 39 (8), pp. 1111-1137; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55 (5), pp. 469-480; Astin, A., (1993) What matters in college?, , 1st ed.SanFranscisco, CA: Jossey-Bass Publishers; Besterfield-Sacre, M., Atman, C., Shuman, L., Characteristics of freshman engineering students: Models for determining student attrition in engineering (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (2), pp. 139-150; Bottomley Laura, J., Rajala Sarah, Porter Richard, Women in engineering at North Carolina State University: an effort in recruitment, retention, and encouragement (1999) Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, 1, pp. 11a51-11a53; Bozick, R., DeLuca, S., Better late than never?

This shift demands that technological skills be more fully integrated with one's academic knowledge of science and mathematics so that the next generation of engineers can reason adaptively, think critically, and be prepared to learn how to learn. Project Lead the Way (PLTW) provides a pre-college curriculum that focuses on the integration of engineering with science and mathematics. We documented the impact that enrollment in PLTW had on student science and math achievement. We consider the enriched integration hypothesis, which states that students taking PLTW courses will show achievement benefits, after controlling for prior achievement and other student and teacher characteristics. We contrast this with alternative hypotheses that propose little or no impact of the engineering coursework on students' math and science achievement (the insufficient integration hypothesis), or that PLTW enrollment might be negatively associated with student achievement (the adverse integration hypothesis). Using multilevel statistical modeling with students (N-140) nested within teachers, we report findings from a quantitative analysis of the relationship between PLTW enrollment and student achievement on state standardized tests of math and science. While students gained in math and science achievement overall from eighth to tenth grade, students enrolled in PLTW foundation courses showed significantly smaller math assessment gains than those in a matched group that did not enroll, and no measurable advantages on science assessments, when controlling for prior achievement and teacher experience. The findings do not support the enriched integration hypothesis. Engineering education programs like PLTW face both challenges and opportunities to effectively integrate academic content as they strive to prepare students for college engineering programs and careers. © 2010.","K-12 engineering education; Math achievement; Science achievement","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Integration; Professional aspects; Teaching; Alternative hypothesis; Engineering coursework; K-12 engineering education; Math achievement; Science achievement; Statistical modeling; Teacher Characteristics; Technological skills; Students","Allison, P.D., (2002) Missing Data, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Barron, B.J.S., Schwartz, D.L., Vye, N.J., Moore, A., Petrosino, A., Zech, L., Bransford, J.D., Doing with Understanding: Lessons from Research on Problem- and Project-Based Learning (1998) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 7 (3-4), pp. 271-311; Bransford, J., Brown, A., Cocking, R., (2000) How people learn: Brain, mind, experience and school, , Washington, DC: National Academies Press; Bransford, J.D., Schwartz, D.L., Rethinking transfer: A simple proposal with ultiple implications (1999) Review of Research in Education, 24, pp. 61-100; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Organizing Knowledge (1998) California Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 90-111; Brophy, S., Klein, S., Portsmore, M., Rogers, C., Advancing engineering education in P-12 classrooms (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3), pp. 369-382; Carroll, J., A model of school learning (1963) Teachers College Record, 64 (8), pp. 723-733; Committee on Science, engineering, and public policy (2007) Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future, , Washington, DC: National Academies Press; (2004) On Evaluating Curricular Effectiveness: Judging the Quality of K-12 Mathematics Evaluations, , Confrey, J., and V.

More specifically, we present findings from a series of moderated interactive sessions held at international engineering education conferences between July 2007 and December 2008, where participants were asked to discuss the current state and future trajectory of engineering education research. How did AGCEER session attendees describe: (1) the relationship between engineering education research and educational practice, policy considerations, and industry, and (2) important stakeholders, mechanisms/strategies, and challenges for relating research to practice, policy, and industry? Thematic analysis was used to categorize and understand the textual data of report back transcripts and note pages from ten AGCEER sessions involving 300 participants on six continents. An open coding procedure was used to capture issues raised in each of the sessions on the relation of research to practice, policy, and industry. We observed frequent discussion and widespread consensus among AGCEER participants about the need to relate engineering education research to the practice of engineering teaching. Discussions about relating research to policy and industry remain formative, but appear to be gaining traction. We propose a cyclic model to better conceptualize how engineering education research can be strategically related to practice, profession, and industry across diverse local and global contexts. © 2010.",,"Education; Engineering research; Professional aspects; Engineering education research; Engineering teachings; Global capacity; Global context; Interactive session; International engineering education; Session attendees; Thematic analysis; Engineering education","Abbott, A., Status and status strain in the professions (1981) American Journal of Sociology, 86 (4), pp. 815-835; Abbott, A., (2001) Chaos of disciplines, , Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press; (2010) Annals of Research on Engineering Education (AREE), , http://www.areeonline.org/, last accessed, November 2009; Educational research and methods (2008) AAEE Newsletter, , http://www.aaee.com.au/newsletters/Newsletter%20March%202008_files/index. html, Australasian association for engineering education ERM March 2008.last accessed, November 2009; Ball, D.L., (2003) Mathematical proficiency for all students: Toward a strategic research and development program in mathematics education, , Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation; Becher, T., The Significance of Disciplinary Differences (1994) Studies in Higher Education, 19 (2), p. 151; Biesta, G., Bridging the gap between educational research and educational practice: The need for critical distance (2007) Educational Research and Evaluation: An International Journal on Theory and Practice, 13 (3), pp. 295-301; Biglan, A., The characteristics of subject matter in different academic areas (1973) Journal of Applied Psychology, 57 (3), pp. 195-203; Blume, S.S., After the darkest hour Integrity and engagement in the development of university research (1985) The University Research System: The Public Policies of the Home Of Scientists, pp. 139-165. , (5th ed.), eds.

The landscape for engineering education studies that invoke the concept of culture is complex and multi-faceted, yet still ill-defined and incomplete. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS): The aim of this study is to develop a conceptual framework of cultural dimensions that has the potential to guide the understanding of culture in the context of engineering education to demonstrate ""where we are"" and ""how to get where we want to go."" DESIGN/METHOD: Ethnographic methods within an overarching interpretivist research paradigm were used to investigate the culture of engineering education as manifested in one institution. Adapting Schein's cultural framework, the data were collected and analyzed to distil from observable behaviors and practices the essence of the culture in the form of tacitly known cultural norms, shared assumptions, and understandings that underpinned the lived experience of staff and students. RESULTS: The findings are discussed within six cultural dimensions which emerged from the data as: An Engineering Way of Thinking, An Engineering Way of Doing, Being an Engineer, Acceptance of Difference, Relationships and Relationship to the Environment. CONCLUSIONS: The detailed findings from this study, combined with evidence from other studies, support the view that the proposed six dimensions have the potential to be transferred to other institutions as a practical tool for evaluating and positioning the culture of engineering education.","Cultural dimensions; Culture; Engineering education","Cell culture; Education; Professional aspects; Conceptual frameworks; Cultural dimensions; Cultural landscape; Cultural norms; Culture change; Ethnographic methods; Interpretivist; Observable behavior; Engineering education","(1996) Engineering Criteria 2000, , Baltimore MD:ABET; Ambrose, S., Changing the culture: What's at the center of engineering education?

PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS): This study identified gender differences on indicators of the undergraduate experience including faculty-related and student-related variables as well as measures of satisfaction with the institutional environment that are related to satisfaction with the engineering major and intent to pursue a career in engineering ten years from now. DESIGN/METHOD: The mixed methods approach used for this investigation involved nine institutions with engineering undergraduate degree programs. An online questionnaire was administered to undergraduate students enrolled in engineering. Qualitative data was collected through focus group interviews with students at each of the nine participating institutions. RESULTS: Findings reveal that satisfaction with the engineering major does not translate directly to pursuing a career in engineering, particularly among women. In terms of elements of the undergraduate experience, some types of interactions with faculty and peers have both short- and long-term impacts on interest in engineering as a major and as a career. CONCLUSIONS: Creating learning environments that emphasize care and respect for students as well as overseeing student interaction during group work can make a difference in students' satisfaction in the engineering major and in interest in engineering as a career, particularly for women.","Engineering workforce; Student satisfaction; Undergraduate experience","Computer aided instruction; Education; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Educational institutions; Engineering undergraduates; Learning environments; Online questionnaire; Student satisfaction; Students' satisfaction; Undergraduate experience; Undergraduate students; Students","Alfeld-Liro, C., Frome, P., Eccles, J., (1996) Factors That Distinguish Young Women Who Continue or Discontinue Male-typed Occupational Aspirations Two Years after High School, , Paper Presented at the Biennial Meeting of the Society for Research on Adolescence.

PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS): To validate an instrument designed to measure individuals' self-concepts toward engineering design tasks, three research questions were investigated: (a) how well the items in the instrument represent the engineering design process in eliciting the task-specific self-concepts of self-efficacy, motivation, outcome expectancy and anxiety, (b) how well the instrument predicts differences in the self-efficacy held by individuals with a range of engineering experiences, and (c) how well the responses to the instrument align with the relationships conceptualized in self-efficacy theory. DESIGN/METHOD: A 36-item online instrument was developed and administered to 202 respondents. Three types of validity evidence were obtained for (a) representativeness of multi-step engineering design processes in eliciting self-efficacy, (b) the instrument's ability to differentiate groups of individuals with different levels of engineering experience and (c) relationships between self-efficacy, motivation, outcome expectancy, and anxiety as predicted by self-efficacy theory. RESULTS: Results indicate that the instrument can reliably identify individuals' engineering design self-efficacy (α = 0.967), motivation (α = 0.955), outcome expectancy (α = 0.967) and anxiety (α = 0.940). One-way ANOVA identified statistical differences in self-efficacy between high, intermediate and low experience groups at the ρ < 0.05 level. Self-efficacy was also shown to be correlated to motivation (0.779), outcome expectancy (0.919) and anxiety (-0.593) at the ρ < 0.01 level. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the instrument was capable of identifying individuals' self-concepts specific to the engineering design tasks.","Assessment; Engineering design; Self-efficacy","Design; Motivation; Assessment; Engineering design; Engineering design process; On-line instruments; Research questions; Self efficacy; Self-efficacy theories; Statistical differences; Engineering education","(1999) Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, , American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association and National Council on Measurement in Education Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association; Atkinson, J.W., Motivational determinants of risk-taking behavior (1957) Psychological Review, 1 (6), pp. 359-372; Atkinson, J.W., Feather, N.T., (1966) A Theory of Achievement Motivation, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; (1974) Motivation and Achievement, , Atkinson, J.W. and J.O.
