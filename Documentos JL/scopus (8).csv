One example is the branch campuses operated by the University of Nottingham in Malaysia and China which award identical certificates to graduates from common programmes across the three campuses. This paper explores the specific challenges faced by transnational education in the case of a programme which has been validated by a national professional institution and consequently provides graduates with partial exemption from the full process of gaining individual professional recognition, typified by engineering education where programme validation by engineering institutions is highly prized by prospective students. An example is described where the local accreditation panels from different countries required different programme features from what was designed as a common, transnational, programme delivered in three countries. Achieving degree accreditation for students graduating in each different country is clearly challenging when maintaining the undifferentiated status of the degree, and whilst international agreements appear to provide a supportive framework for transnational education, this paper concludes that specific requirements of individual national accrediting bodies will continue to prove challenging to the higher education institutions involved.",,"Engineering accreditation; Engineering institutions; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Professional institution; Professional recognition; Transnational educations; University of Nottingham; Accreditation; Engineering education; Students","(2009) Learning without borders project brief., , http://intercurriculum.curtin.edu.au/project.html, ALTC Available from [accessed 27.05.2012]; Choudaha, R., Mobility of Chinese and Indian students International Higher Education, pp. 8-9. , http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/research/cihe/ihe.html, no. 68, summer 2012, Available from [accessed 27.05.2012]; (2011) The accreditation of higher education programmes: UK standards for professional competence., , http://www.engc.org.uk/education--skills/accreditation/information-for-universities, Engineering Council, London: Engineering Council.

This project investigated the apparent contradiction between this high demand for engineering graduates and an unemployment rate of about 13% amongst UK engineering graduates. Employability has received huge attention in recent years but there remains a distinct issue of why some engineers do not get graduate level work within a short time of graduation. The project interviewed a selection of unemployed graduates in order to investigate their experiences and gain an understanding of factors impeding their entry into graduate engineering employment. The data was analysed in the context of both previous research and data from interviews with engineering employers and employed graduates. Emerging from this study is that there is no single reason for unemployment amongst engineering graduates, with key findings centring on the importance of students' early engagement with career planning and the final year application process, relevant work experience, the distinction between the MEng and the BEng in employers' recruitment criteria and the ability of graduates to articulate their skills and competences effectively.",,"Application process; Career planning; Engineering employers; Engineering graduates; Graduate levels; Skills and competences; Unemployment rates; Work experience; Employment; Professional aspects; Students; Engineering education","(2010) Summer review 2010, , Association of Graduate Recruiters, Warwick: Association of Graduate Recruiters; Barr, B., UK civil engineering education in the twenty-first century (2008) Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Management, Procurement and Law, 161, pp. 17-23; (2010) Ready to grow: Business priorities for education and skills., , Confederation of British Industry, London: Confederation of British Industry; (2011) BIS research paper number 31: STEM graduates in non-STEM jobs, , Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, London: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills; (2011) Engineering UK 2011: The state of engineering., , EngineeringUK.

In recent years, there have been significant advances in information technology (IT), while a new generation of applications that are able to harness the power of the world wide web has been introduced under the banner of Web 2.0. The increased capabilities of IT and the nature of Web 2.0 applications have attracted interest from the academic community as a means of enhancing the delivery of higher education. This paper considers the implications of introducing technology into the higher education sector from the perspectives of academic staff and students, with particular emphasis on the use of technology and Web 2.0 applications, and the relationship between technology and teaching and learning. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies has been adopted. Online questionnaires were completed by 22 members of academic staff and 107 students from the University of Bradford's School of Engineering, Design and Technology. Interviews with university staff and the School's undergraduate students complemented the questionnaires. The results demonstrate a good awareness and usage of technology among academic staff and students alike, with certain Web 2.0 applications (particularly social networking) being widely used by students but less so by academic staff. Overall, technology is largely viewed as a positive contributor to the learning experience.",,"Design and technology; Global information society; Learning experiences; Online questionnaire; Quantitative methodology; School of engineering; Teaching and learning; Undergraduate students; Engineering education; Information technology; Social sciences computing; Surveys; World Wide Web; Students","Bennett, S., Maton, K., Kervin, L., The 'digital natives' debate: A critical review of the evidence (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 39 (5), pp. 775-786; Churchill, D., Educational applications of Web 2.0: Using blogs to support teaching and learning (2009) British Journal of Educational Technology, 40 (1), pp. 179-183; (2009) Higher education in a Web 2.0 world: Report of an inquiry into the impact of higher education of students' widespread use of Web 2.0 technologies., , http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/heweb20rptv1.pdf, CLEX (Committee of Inquiry into the Changing Learner Experience) Available from [accessed 28 November 2011]; (2009) Engineering Education: Journal of the Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre.

The change towards mechatronic products with a growing portion of information technology requires a holistic education approach to fulfil the requirements on engineers and their education. This paper suggests a potential solution for the interdisciplinary challenge of an information technology course for engineering. Higher functionality and complexity of almost any kind of product do not only affect the product itself but also the product engineering process. Systems engineering is a promising way to successfully design a mechatronic product. A number of requirements arise out of the need to understand and operate with mechatronics and engineering processes, e.g. interdisciplinary teamwork or systemoriented thinking. For a university one of the goals of education should always be the employability of all graduates. With only isolated knowledge of a few special disciplines the demand of the global job market for engineers is by far not met. The educational vision is derived from all relevant requirements and tries to provide students with an interdisciplinary and holistic understanding of the engineering process. This includes technical and methodological expertise, social and communicative skills and decision making and responsibility. A concrete implementation of this vision in engineering education has to fulfil all technical requirements, prepare the student for the global job market and still keep the motivation at a high level. Integrating mechatronic products into the curriculum is a promising way to successful engineering education.","Information technology; Interdisciplinary education; Product engineering","Engineering process; Holistic educations; Interdisciplinary education; Interdisciplinary teamwork; Mechatronic products; Potential solutions; Product engineering; Technical requirement; Commerce; Curricula; Employment; Engineering; Engineering education; Product design; Students; Information technology","Grasso, D., Burkins, M., Beyond technology: The holistic advantage (2010) Holistic Engineering Education: Beyond Technology, , Grasso D. and Burkins M., (Springer, New York); Austin, W., Wheaton, M., Tang, C., Goodman, M., The practice of systems engineering: A foundation for technical leadership (2010) Holistic Engineering Education: Beyond Technology, , Grasso D. and Burkins M., (Springer, New York); Kühnl, C., (2010) Software Gibt Den Takt Vor [Me] - Mechatronik & Engineering, (2), pp. 24-25. , AGT Verlag Thum GmbH, Ludwigsburg; Philip, E., Producing workers: Employability and quality in higher education (2008) Quality Education: Prospects and Challenges, , George D., (APH Publishing Corporation, New Delhi); Grabowski, U., Erfolgsfaktor persönlichkeit: anforderungen an eine ganzheitliche ingenieurausbildung (2004) Global J. of Engng.

As a result, in educating young designers the education philosophy employed in teaching product design demands an input from both technological and humanistic perspectives. Design demands compromise and only when due consideration is made to all relevant areas leading to optimal decisions being taken will good design result. It is imperative that engineering design students not only learn the importance of this but adopt into their design activities such a philosophy as second nature. Design output may be considered as delivering a ""specification to manufacture"" and accurate communication is imperative for all down-stream activities to occur. With a foundation in mathematics and sciences, the subject of technology is often shunned if not feared by design students. The challenge is to encourage and nurture appropriate skills and knowledge to enable development of the designers to meet future design industries demands. This paper discusses a project based teaching approach employing input from cross discipline sources that culminates in a major design activity in the students final year. Experience and benefits gained are described with particular emphasis being given to the way hard technology is integrated with human requirements and sociological considerations to enable optimal design decisions to be made.","Creativity; Design education; Humanistic; Technology","Creativity; Design Education; Engineering design; Holistic approach; Humanistic; Manufactured products; Optimal design decisions; Teaching approaches; Engineering education; Ontology; Students; Technology; Product design","Pyle, I., Mathematics - The lost art?

Observations and data have been collected over several cohorts to bring a valuable perspective to the approaches piloted across two similar university departments while trialling a number of innovative learning strategies. In addition to the concurrent institutional studies the work explores curriculum design that applies the principles of Co-Design, multidisciplinary and trans disciplinary learning, with both engineering and product design students working alongside each other through a practical problem solving learning approach known as the CDIO learning initiative (Conceive, Design Implement and Operate) [1]. The study builds on previous work presented at the 2010 EPDE conference: The Effect of Personality on the Design Team: Lessons from Industry for Design Education [2]. The subsequent work presented in this paper applies the findings to mixed design and engineering team based learning, building on the insight gained through a number of industrial process case studies carried out in current design practice. Developments in delivery also aligning the CDIO principles of learning through doing into a practice based, collaborative learning experience and include elements of the TRIZ creative problem solving technique [3]. The paper will outline case studies involving a number of mixed engineering and design student projects that highlight the CDIO principles, combined with an external industrial design brief. It will compare and contrast the learning experience with that of a KTP derived student project, to examine an industry based model for student projects.

This is particularly so in the higher educational fields and specifically so within the context of the global market positioning of many MBA programs currently. However, in many cases, it would appear that business schools are typically embarking on a journey of curriculum development from the point of the core teaching of business methodologies (i.e. silo thinking), rather than incorporating best practice from other disciplines such as those found in leading design and engineering education, where, for example, applied and immersive exercises and project based assignments embed learning and develop a richer knowledge base for the students. There are, however, significant challenges when attempting to transfer best practice from other educational disciplines into the business education environment. These include: designing the structural framework for the courses whilst incorporating relevant innovation, creativity and innovative thinking catalysts that are cross discipline and transferable within many cultural contexts simultaneously. Within this constraint, it is critical to design exercises that make sense to the multicultural and diverse student body, whilst being tangible, tactile and inclusive (i.e. immersed in the subject). Furthermore, the underpinning of complex theoretical principles, simply and effectively, is necessary if student learning outcomes are to be achieved. As such, developing assessment protocols that measure the understanding and application of curriculum material post the classroom environment is essential in maintaining learning momentum and knowledge retention. This paper discusses the current thinking, application and learning from the work to date on re-designing the framework and protocols for incorporating innovative and creative themes into higher business education. This paper also illustrates some of the high-impact accelerator learning sessions that have been developed from design and engineering educational principles and transferred into business education. Evidence is also provided to demonstrate how these protocols are remembered by the students post their graduation and how many students continue to use them in their professional practice.","Benchmark; Design; Education; Innovation creativity; MBA; Teaching","Assessment protocols; Classroom environment; Curriculum development; Educational principles; MBA; Professional practices; Structural frameworks; Student learning outcomes; Benchmarking; Curricula; Design; Education; Engineering education; International trade; Knowledge based systems; Product design; Teaching; Students","Mintzberg, H., (2004) Managers Not MBSs, , Berrett-Koehler Publishers Inc.

The patent system discourages the copy of registered technologies, and it allows the investment of resources in applied research to do new products. Currently the patent system is not much used in engineering design education, but it is necessary to prepare future engineers towards product innovation. In this article is explained the experience carried out in new product design and drafting patent in a free elective course entitled: Creativity, Ecodesign and Patents. It is commented the methodology of this process, from the election of the topic work of each group of students, to the drafting a corresponding patent. A case study of one work group of 2011-12 academic year, deals of a refrigerator redesign, in order to save energy and increase their efficiency. A patent application for this work was done and the group of students showed their interest and extra dedication to make it. A survey conducted to students about their experience of this course is discussed and some conclusions are extracted. Even if students do not perform patents in their future professional careers, the strategy of writing a patent is a good academic exercise to organize and improve the final design.","Conceptual design; Creativity; Engineering education; Patent drafting","Applied research; Creativity; Engineering design education; New product design; Patent applications; Patent drafting; Product innovation; Professional careers; Conceptual design; Employment; Engineering; Engineering education; Investments; Patents and inventions; Students; Product design","Oxford Dictionaries: "" Patent"", , http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/patent, Accesed, April 2012; Creativity Ecodesign and Patents (""Creativitat Ecodisseny i Patents"") Free Elective Course 2011- 12 UPC.

Delivery of under-graduate degrees, such as those offered in the Yacht Engineering Programme at SSU, are moving increasingly towards a more flexible and student-centred approach, with work in the ""Blended Learning"" technique and On-Line Learning Unit Design finding real potential at this level. Students are now entering university with an expectation that many of the technologies and communication mediums available to them in everyday life will be fully available within the H.E environment. This paper addresses the work being carried out as part of a personal research programme by the Author in completing a higher degree award Master of Professional Development (M Prof), firstly summarising early findings then identifying on-going challenges in completing the work. SSU has a supportive stance in assisting lecturing staff working in this way as part of the C.P.D programme in place within the Maritime and Technology Faculty (MARTEC) in this instance.

Alumni associations present first-hand opportunities for educational institutions to understand the ever-changing demands and expectations of the Industry and develop their curriculums accordingly. In times where Universities receive less funding from governments and have to depend more on networking within the Industry for funding, alumni associations have an important role to play. By effectively exploiting the everlasting nostalgic feeling of their graduates engineering institutions can come up with various curricular and co-curricular activities which can attract responsible alumni members to actively participate in the overall development of the institutes.

AI techniques have also been identified as one of the most valuable applications in the field of special educational needs (SEN). The goal of these tools is to enhance the way children interact with their environment to promote learning and to enrich their daily life. Due to the implicit characteristics of special educational needs, the diagnosis has been an issue of major importance. At the same time intervention strategies need to be highly individualized to be effective.

This study investigates how to encourage knowledge contribution in a large Asia online engineering education project. Based on long-term empirical research, we found economic incentive is more critical to facilitate explicit knowledge contribution, while social incentive is more important in encouraging tacit knowledge contribution. Moreover, we also found incentives may have different effects due to students' individual difference, e.g., personal value.

In this paper, a new tool for engineering education is presented: it is an automatic hepatitis diagnosis system based on associative memories. The characteristic of this approach is twofold: first, learning the fundamental set of associations in order to get an associative memory; second, computing a differential associative memory in order to get a threshold value for each unknown input pattern to be classified. Hepatitis disease dataset, taken from UCI machine learning repository, was used as medical dataset. Classification accuracy of the proposed approach is 82.67% and it was assessed using stratified 10 fold cross-validation. The correct diagnosis performance of the proposed approach is validated not only using classification accuracy, but also performing sensitivity and specificity analysis. The results presented in this paper demonstrate associative memories potential for automatic medical diagnosis systems. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Associative memories; Decision support systems; Engineering education;

Funding agencies, such as NSF, via the Advanced Technological Education Program (ATE), are supporting initiatives and research aimed at increasing the number of technicians and engineers and improving science, mathematics performance, and technological literacy among pre-college populations. This study focused on projects and programs awarded under the NSF-ATE program. It aimed to understand their approaches to K-12 engineering and technology education. Forty eight percent of the 2009 spring-summer active awards with K-12 components were identified. Through a mixed-method design, 49 NSF-ATE award representatives responded to an online survey, and five were interviewed after their online responses were analyzed. Results show that ""pathways to increase the number of engineers and technicians"" was the most prevalent goal, that their activities were more informational than instructional, that and their concerns concentrated primarily on their evaluations.","Nsf-ate program; Technological literacy; Two-year institutions","Advanced Technological Education; Funding agencies; K-12 engineering; Nsf-ate program; Online surveys; Postsecondary education; Pre-college; Technological literacy; Technical presentations; Engineering education","(2004) The Engineer of 2020 Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering.

Searches were conducted through education and engineering library engines and databases as well as queries in established publications in engineering education. More than 50 publications were found, including books, articles, and reviews that discussed P-12 engineering education research efforts. With the synthesis of literature and distinct criteria to classify the literature, a rubric was developed. This rubric allowed authors to synthesize retrieved publications in seven ways: (1) overarching agenda, (2) nature of the engineering program or intervention, (3) assessment methods, (4) object of the study/unit of analysis, (5) population/ sample of interest, (6) informing theory, and (7) standards addressed. Discussions of the current levels of research based on recommendations of National Agencies are presented along with a set of recommendations for the advancement of the P-12 engineering education research.",,"Assessment methods;

One project from a comprehensive middle school engineering curriculum developed by the authors is described to show how active learning and state frameworks can coexist. The theoretical basis for learning and assessment in a project-based curriculum is presented as a more favorable approach to teaching engineering in middle school. We address the unique issues of middle school students and how they engage the engineering process. We conclude that project-based active learning is integral in a successful engineering education program for middle school students.","Middle school engineering; Project-based learning; State engineering frameworks","Active Learning; Engineering curriculum; Engineering frameworks; Engineering process; Key parts; Middle school; Middle school students; Project based learning; Project-based; Project-based curriculum; Theoretical basis; Turbine designs; Curricula; Engineering education","(2006) Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering, pp. 81-99. , Curriculum Framework, (Malden, MA: Massachusetts DESE, October, Massachusetts DESE); Richards, L., Hallock, A., Schnittka, C., Getting Them Early: Teaching Engineering Design in Middle Schools (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (5), pp. 874-883; Rivoli, G., Ralston, P., (2009) Elementary and Middle School Engineering Outreach: Building a STEM Pipeline, , ASEE Southeast Section Conference, Marietta, GA, April 5-7; Hynes, M., Dos Santos, A., Effective Teacher Professional Development: Middle-School Engineering Content (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (1), pp. 24-29; Reynolds, B., Mehalik, M., Lovell, M., Schunn, C., Increasing Student Awareness of, and Interest in Engineering as a Career Option through Design-Based Learning (2009) International Journal of Engineering Education, 25 (4), pp. 788-798; (1989) Characteristics of Middle Grade Students, Caught in the Middle, pp. 144-148. , (Sacremento, CA: California Department of Education), California Department of Education; Doppelt, Y., Mehalik, M., Schunn, C., Silk, E., Krysinski, D., Engagement and Achievement: A Case Study of Design-Based Learning in a Science Context (2008) Journal of Technology Education, 19 (2), pp. 22-39; Staver, J., Constructivism: Sound Theory for Explicating the Practice of Science and Science Teaching (1998) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 35 (5), pp. 501-520; Rotjer, J., (2009) Proceedings of the 37th Annual SEFI Conference, , PBL and Constructivism in Engineering Education, Delft Rotterdam, July 1-4; Vygotsky, L.S., (1978) Mind in Society, , (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press 1978); Cheville, A., Transformative Experiences: Scaffolding Design Learning through the Vygotsky Cycle (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (4), pp. 760-770; Prince, M., Felder, R., Inductive teaching and Learning Methods: Definitions, Comparisons, and Research Bases (2006) Journal of Engineering Education, 95 (2), pp. 123-138; Kolodner, J., Camp, P., Crismond, D., Fasse, B., Gray, J., Holbrook, J., Puntambekar, S., Ryan, M., Problem-Based Learning Meets Case-Based Reasoning in the Middle School Classroom: Putting Learning by DesignTM Into Practice (2003) The Journal of the Learning Sciences, 2 (4), pp. 495-547; Kolodner, J., Facilitating the Learning of Design Practices: Lessons Learned from an Inquiry into Science Education (2002) Journal of Industrial Teacher Education, 39 (3); Prince, M., Does Active Learning Work?

The results discussed in this paper focused on the teachers' instruction and knowledge of the central aspects of the engineering design process (EDP)-the purpose of the EDP, that the EDP is a cyclical, iterative process, and that the EDP fosters communication. The analysis of the videotaped classroom observation data revealed that the teachers as a group covered the central ideas regarding 1. Purpose of the EDP and 2. EDP as a cyclical process quite well. Every teacher touched upon at least one of the sub-ideas for these two central ideas. The teachers did not cover 3. EDP for fostering communication well. Only Frieda and Monica conveyed anything regarding this idea to their students. This paper explores each central idea and the teachers' understandings of them as expressed through their explanations in the classroom observations and follow-up interviews.","Engineering design process; Engineering education; Teacher knowledge; Teacher professional development","Engineering design process; Engineering unit; Iterative process; Massachusetts; Middle school; Observation data; Pedagogical content knowledge; Public schools; Subject matters; Teacher knowledge; Teacher professional development; Communication; Engineering education; Teaching; Video recording; Engineering","Adams, R.S., Atman, C.J., (2000) Characterizing engineering student design processes: An illustration of iteration, pp. 18-21. , Paper presented at the ASEE Annual Conference, St. Louis, MO.

Determination of OSQ on certain institutional aspects is done by various agencies throughout the world. Each system uses a different set of weighted indicators to measure the overall service quality of institutions. Five service quality factors, namely professionalism, integrated education, facilities, responsiveness and empathy are considered in the study. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to determine the aggregate weights of the factors to handle the vagueness present in the linguistic values of the stakeholders' subjective opinions. Final weights of the factors are assessed by taking the distances of each factor between Fuzzy Positive Ideal Rating and Fuzzy Negative Ideal Rating. An illustrative study is presented to determine the OSQ of EEIs. The results help to focus on the factors which need immediate attention to enhance the quality of EEIs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","engineering education; fuzzy logic; integrated education;

While an identified learning objective of laboratories is to support the understanding of the relationship between models and reality, the paper illustrates that this understanding is hindered by inherently limited experiments and that there is scope for improvement. Despite the contextualisation of learning activities having been shown to support learning objectives in many fields, there is traditionally little contextual information presented during laboratory experimentation. The paper argues that the enhancing laboratory activity with contextual information affords an opportunity to improve students' understanding of the relationship between the theoretical model and the experiment (which is effectively a proxy for the complex real world), thereby improving their understanding of the relationship between the model and reality. The authors propose that these improvements can be achieved by setting remote laboratories within context-rich virtual worlds. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","context; engineering education; experimentation; laboratory; models; virtual world","context; Contextual information; Contextualisation; experimentation; Immersive virtual environments; Laboratory experiments; Learning Activity; Learning objectives; Remote laboratories; Support learning; Theoretical models; Virtual worlds; Engineering education; Experiments; Interactive computer graphics; Models; Virtual reality; Laboratories","Abdulwahed, M., Nagy, Z.K., Blanchard, R., Beyond the classroom walls: remote labs, authentic experimentation with theory lectures [online] Proceedings of the nineteenth annual conference of the Australian Association for Engineering Education, to industry and beyond, , http://hdl.handle.net/2134/4938, Australia, Yeppoon, Australia, Available from: [Accessed 30 August 2012]; Anderson, W.B., (1914) Physics for technical students: Mechanics and heat, pp. 112-122. , New York, New York,: McGraw Hill; Bailer-Jones, D., When scientific models represent (2003) International Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 17 (1), pp. 59-74. , (doi:10.1080/02698590305238); Bender, E.A., An introduction to mathematical modeling (1978), http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=adf515kSDOkC&pgis=1, [online] Courier Dover, 268.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the approaches used by engineering students when solving an open-ended engineering problem. A think-aloud method was used to collect data about the problem-solving approaches of eight materials engineering students. Through the use of script analysis three approaches to solving the problem were identified, which were consistent with the Reflective Judgment Model of epistemic development. Students who used a linear, systematic approach were most successful at solving the problem. Less successful students were overwhelmed by its open-endedness and/or became fixated on a single aspect of the problem. These results point to a need to develop open-ended problem-solving skills throughout the engineering curriculum. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","engineering education research; epistemology; problem-solving; think-aloud protocol","Engineering curriculum; Engineering education research; Engineering practices; Engineering problems; epistemology; Materials engineering; Open-ended problems; Problem solving skills; Qualitative study; Think-aloud protocol; Engineering; Engineering education; Students; Problem solving","(2008) 2009-2010 Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, , Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Baltimore, MD, Baltimore, MD,: ABET; Adams, R.S., Turns, J., Atman, C.J., Educating effective engineering designers: the role of reflective practice (2003) Design Studies, 24 (3), pp. 275-294. , (doi:10.1016/S0142-694X(02)00056-X); Ahmed, S., Wallace, K.M., Blessing, L.T., Understanding the differences between how novice and experienced designers approach design tasks (2003) Research in Engineering Design, 14 (1), pp. 1-11; Atman, C.J., A comparison of freshman and senior engineering design processes (1999) Design Studies, 20 (2), pp. 131-152. , (doi:10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00031-3); Atman, C.J., The design processes of engineering educators: thick descriptions and potential implications [online] http://research.it.uts.edu.au/creative/design/papers/32AtmanDTRS6.pdf, Expertise in Design: Design Thinking Research Symposium, Available from: [Accessed 8 November 2012]; Atman, C.J., Comparing freshman and senior engineering design processes: an in-depth follow-up study (2004) Design studies, 26 (4), pp. 325-357. , (doi:10.1016/j.destud.2004.09.005); Atman, C.J., Engineering design processes: a comparison of students and expert practitioners (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (4); Atman, C.J., Breadth in problem scoping: a comparison of freshman and senior engineering students (2008) International Journal of Engineering Education, 24 (2); Blanchard-Fields, F., Everyday problem solving and emotion (2007) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 16 (1); Brodie, L.M., eProblem-based learning: problem-based learning using virtual teams (2009) European Journal of Engineering Education, 34 (6), pp. 497-509. , (doi:10.1080/03043790902943868); William, D.C., (2007) Materials science and engineering: An introduction, , New York, New York,: John Wiley and Sons; Cardella, M.E., Atman, C.J., Adams, R.S., Mapping between design activities and external representations for engineering student designers (2006) Design Studies, 27 (1), pp. 5-24. , (doi:10.1016/j.destud.2005.05.001); Cardellini, L., The foundations of radical constructivism: an interview with Ernst Von Glasersfeld (2006) Foundations of Chemistry, 8 (2), pp. 177-187. , (doi:10.1007/s10698-006-9012-z); Chi, M.T.H., Glaser, R., Farr, M.J., (1988) The nature of expertise, , Hillsdale, NJ, Hillsdale, NJ,: Lawrence Erlbaum; Crotty, M., (1998) The foundations of social research, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; de Graaf, E., Kolmos, A., Characteristics of problem-based learning (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (5), pp. 657-662; Denayer, I., Teaching a structured approach to the design process for undergraduate engineering students by problem-based education (2003) European Journal of Engineering Education, 28 (2), pp. 203-214. , (doi:10.1080/0304379031000079031); Diefes-Dux, H.A., A framework for posing open-ended engineering problems: model-eliciting activities [online] http://fie-conference.org/fie2004/index.htm, Presented at the 34th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, Savannah, GA, Available from: [Accessed 8 November 2012]; Dym, C.L., Engineering design thinking teaching and learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 103-120; Ericsson, A., Simon, H., (1993) Protocol analysis: Verbal reports as data, , revised, Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Bradford; Ericsson, K.A., Smith, J., (1991) Toward a general theory of expertise: Prospects and limits, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; (2008) EUR-ACE Framework Standards for the Accreditation of Engineering Programmes, , European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education, Brussels, Brussels,: ENAEE; Fonteyn, M., Kuipers, B., Grobe, S., A description of think aloud method and protocol analysis (1993) Qualitative Health Research, 3 (4), pp. 430-441. , (doi:10.1177/104973239300300403); Fosnot, C., Constructivism revisited: implications and reflections (2005) Constructivism: Theory, perspectives, and practice, pp. 276-291. , In: Fosnot C., editors second, New York, New York,: Teachers College Press; Funkesson, K., Anbacken, E.-M., Ek, A.-C., Nurses' reasoning process during care planning taking pressure ulcer prevention as an example.

The laboratory has an in-scale model of a turbo-ferry tf-120 which keeps all the hydrodynamic characteristics of the full-scale vessel. The physical model was developed to be autonomous and is controlled remotely from a PC using Wi-Fi communications. It has the instruments commonly used in vessels such as: GPS, UMI, accelerometers and gyrocompass.

The major gender differences discussed in this study include the problem discovering and solving abilities, maneuverability, and inquiry attitude among middle grade students. In the project design, students were required to design and complete a wooden robot with limited materials in a restricted timeframe. Data was collected through field study during the project making. The results of this study indicated that some differences existed between male and female students. For example, power tool manupulation was more appealing to boys than girls. On the other hand, girls were better at resource management than boys. Through social learning, female students have an overtime improvement. Pedagogical considerations are suggested to strengthen gender-specific problem solving skills, so that all students can realize their design potential. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Gender difference; Junior high school student; Problem solving; Social Cognitive learning; Technological design","Cognitive learning; Female students; Field studies; Gender differences; Junior high schools; Power tools; Problem solving skills; Project designs; Resource management; Social learning; Technological projects; Technology projects; Machine design; Problem solving; Students; Engineering education","Akkerman, S., Van Den Bossche, P., Admiraal, W., Gijselaers, W., Segers, M., Simons, R.J., Reconsidering group cognition: From conceptual confusion to a boundary area between cognitive and socio-cultural perspectives?

Information technology for continuous patient health education and counseling could be a powerful means for health promotion and disease prevention however delivery of smoking cessation programs in hospitals via interactive technology has not be widely implemented. The goal of this project was to develop an interactive platform for patient health education and evaluate its feasibility in hospitalized smokers. We developed a universal platform for Individualized Continuous Patient Education (iCOPE). This platform is a comprehensive informatics framework for rapid adaptation and dissemination of Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) products tailored to different categories of health consumers including difficult-to-reach patients. The iCOPE platform implements universal means for customized delivery of CER information in the format of interactive self-paced educational modules, quick ""question & answer"" guides, and interactive decision aids. In addition, the iCOPE platform will support the innovative concept of continuous patient health education by providing patients with easy access to the interactive CER updates via web, MP3 players and phone-based interactive voice response (IVR) technology. We tested usability and acceptance of educational platforms in patients who are active smokers. Our results demonstrated high acceptance of this technology by patients and its potential to facilitate smoking cessation. © 2012 IEEE.","computer-assisted instruction; e-learning; health education; smoking cessation","Comparative effectiveness; Computer Assisted Instruction; Customized delivery; Decision aids; Disease prevention; Educational platforms; Health education; Health promotion; Informatics; Interactive platform; Interactive technology; Interactive voice response; MP-3 players; Patient education; Patient health; Rapid adaptation; smoking cessation; Universal platform; Computer aided instruction; Decision support systems; E-learning; Health; Information technology; Innovation; Engineering education","Fox, M.P., A systematic review of the literature reporting on studies that examined the impact of interactive, computer-based patient education programs (2009) Patient Educ Couns, 77 (1), pp. 6-13. , Review.

This paper proposes an RFID-enabled Engineering Workshop Training Center (EWTC) by first integrating the Teaching by Examples and Learning by Doing (TELD) principle to enhance the teaching efficiency and effectiveness. ''Teaching by examples'' allows the students to ''see and then remember'', while, ''Learning by Doing'' allows students to ''do and then understand''. Secondly, EWTC uses RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology to convert various resources into smart teaching objects (STOs), which are connected by wireless networks in order to collect real-time information in an intelligent ambience. Finally, it adopts the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) model to develop the system architecture to use the real-time RFID data for facilitating different users' operations and behaviors.Areal-life case study illustrates how the RFID-enabledEWTCrationalizes a typical mechanical workshop training item in a university. By qualitative analysis, the daily operations of typical end-users, such as teaching supervisors, tutors and students are reengineered and improved into a pedagogical level that is real-time, optimal and specific. A set of statistics implies the upgrade of EWTC in quantitative analysis.","Engineering education; Mechanical workshop training; Real-Time; RFID; TELD","Data collection; End-users; Engineering workshops; Learning by doing; Qualitative analysis; Radio frequencies; Real-Time; Real-time information; System architectures; Teaching resources; TELD; Training centers; Education computing; Engineering education; Information services; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Service oriented architecture (SOA); Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Personnel training","Kelly, R., Workshop teaching: An experiment in engineering education Physical Science Measurement and Instrumentation Management and Education-Reviews (1988) IEE Proceedings A, 135 (2), pp. 113-122; Garavan, T.N., O'Cinneide, B., Entrepreneurship education and training programmes:Areview and evaluation-Part 1 (1994) Journal of European Industrial Training, 18 (8), pp. 3-12; Lee, W., Li, J., Cheung, C., Development of a virtual training workshop in ultra-precision machining (2002) International Journal of Engineering Education, 18 (5), pp. 584-596; Kasamoto, N.H., Using workshop-training techniques in the engineering classroom (2001) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 127 (2), pp. 41-44; Stice, J.E., Felder, R.M., Woods, D.R., Rugarcia, A., The future of engineering education IV: Learning how to teach (2000) Chemical Engineering Education, 34 (2), pp. 118-127; Felder, R.M., Woods, D.R., Stice, J.E., Rugarcia, A., The future of engineering education II: Teaching methods that work (2000) Chemical Engineering Education, 34 (1), pp. 26-39; Huang, G.Q., Shen, B., Mak, K., Online courseware engine for teaching by examples and learning by doing (2001) Journal of Educational Technology Systems, 29 (3), pp. 219-236. , www.teld.Net; Huang, G.Q., Shen, B., Mak, K., TELD: Courseware engine as a virtual classroom for active and collaborative teaching (2001) International Journal of Engineering Education, 17 (2), pp. 164-175; Huang, Y.P., Chang, Y.T., Sandnes, F., RFID-based interactive learning in science museums (2010) Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, pp. 697-709; Lehlou, N., Buyurgan, N., Chimka, J.R., An onlinerfid laboratory learning environment (2009) IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 2 (4), pp. 295-303; Berisso, K., Teaching an applications-based radio frequency identification class (2009) The Technology Interface Journal, 10 (1), pp. 1-15; Yin, J., Yang, X., RFID-based ubiquitous learning environment for school students (2008) Proceeding of the 5th IEEE International Conference on Wireless, pp. 176-178. , Mobile, and Ubiquitous Technology in Education.

The simulation tools used in this study are part of the research and learning resources in nanoHUB.org. Data were collected by anonymous and optional online survey questionnaire given to 312 science and engineering students with access to nanoHUB.org. The quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that overall, graduate and undergraduate students reported positive experiences of nanoHUB.org simulation tools and their uses. However, differences were observed in the way undergraduate students reacted to the computational simulations as compared with graduate students. Possible explanations for these differences and suggestions to close this differential gap were also discussed. Potential explanations for these differences are that undergraduate students may have not fully developed graphical literacy skills, may lack the prior knowledge required at the time they interact with the tools, or tools may be too complex. Suggestions to overcome some of these difficulties include the development of well integrated curricular materials, the application of frameworks for technology-enhanced support for inquiry learning, and the use of just-intime instructional supports together with the simulation tools.","Computational simulations; Cyber-enabled learning; Engineering education; NanoHUB.org","Academic level; Computational simulation; Curricular materials; Cyber-enabled learning; Ease-of-use; Exploratory studies; Graduate students; Inquiry learning; Instructional support; Learning outcome; Learning resource; NanoHUB.org; Online surveys; Pedagogical approach; Prior knowledge; Qualitative analysis; Science and engineering; Undergraduate students; Engineering education; Nanotechnology; Tools; Students","Sabelli, N., Complexity Technology science and education (2006) The Journal of Learning Sciences, 15 (1), pp. 5-9; Winn, W., Research into practice: Current trends in educational technology research: The study of learning environments (2002) Educational Psychology Review, 14 (3), pp. 331-351; Magana, A.J., Brophy, S., Bodner, G., Instructors' Intended learning outcomes for using computational simulations as learning tools (2012) Journal of Engineering Education, 101 (2), pp. 220-243; Dede, C., Salzman, M.C., Loftin, R.B., Sprague, D., Multisensory immersion as a modeling environment for learning complex scientific concepts (1999) Modeling and Simulation in Science and Mathematics Education, pp. 282-319. , N.

Further, it has been complemented with significant advances in simulation-based engineering and science (SBE&S). Having become a crucial part of the present infrastructure, SBE&S is central to the application of advances in the conductance of scientific research and engineering practices. These facts clearly signify the need to integrate the use of computational simulation tools in 21st century engineering education curricula as one way to bridge the gap between school engineering and work engineering. The guiding research questions for this study are: (a) What technological pedagogical content knowledge do professors have for incorporating computational simulation tools to convey nanoscale science and engineering-related concepts and practices? and (b) How do students react to an instructor's technological pedagogical content knowledge with computational simulation tools? This study coupled the methodological framework of a case study with the theoretical framework of TPCK. Open-ended interviews, classroom observations, and document analyses were conducted with six engineering professors teaching undergraduate and graduate courses related to nanoscale science and engineering. Thirty-three students of these courses were also interviewed. Analyses present detailed descriptions of how instructors integrated computational simulation tools to support the learning of nanoscale-related concepts. Findings revealed that computational simulations were perceived by students as effective learning tools. Also revealed was that students continued to confront difficulties when interacting with these tools. Implications for education and educational research in engineering relate to the development, the research and implementation scaffolds, and the transparency at the physical/conceptual, mathematical, and computational levels to understand and then overcome student difficulties in learning with computational simulation tools.","Computational simulations; Computer simulations; Engineering education; Nanoscale science and engineering; Qualitative research methods; Technological pedagogical content knowledge","Computational level; Computational simulation; Document analysis; Educational research; Effective learning; Engineering practices; Engineering professors; Graduate course; Human lives; Integrated computational simulation; Methodological frameworks; Nano scale; Nanoscale science; Nanoscale science and engineering; Pedagogical content knowledge; Physical world; Qualitative research methods; Research questions; Scientific researches; Technological advances; Theoretical framework; Bridges; Computer simulation; Curricula; Engineering research; Nanotechnology; Scaffolds; Students; Teaching; Tools; Engineering education","World Technology Evaluation Center (WTEC), International assessment of research and development in simulationbased engineering and science, World Technology Evaluation Center, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, 2009; Oden, J.T., Belytschko, T., Fish, J., Hughes, T.J., Johnson, C., Keyes, D., Laub, A., Yip, S., (2006) Revolutionizing Engineering and Science Through Simulation, , National Science Foundation (NSF), Blue Ribbon Panel on Simulation-Based Engineering and Science; Johri, A., Olds, B.M., Situated engineering learning: Bridging engineering education research and the learning sciences (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 151-185; http://www.ncn.purdue.edu/, Accessed 9 April 2006; McLennan, M., Add Rappture to Your Software Development, , http://www.nanohub.org/resources/240/, Accessed 10 March 2010; Magana, A.J., Brophy, S., Bodner, G., Instructors' intended learning outcomes for using computational simulations as learning tools (2012) Journal of Engineering Education, 101 (2), pp. 220-243; Koehler, M.J., Mishra, P., What happens when teachers design educational technology? the development of technological pedagogical content knowledge (2005) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 32 (2), pp. 131-152; Mishra, P., Koehler, M.J., Technological pedagogical content knowledge: A framework for teacher knowledge (2006) Teachers College Record, 108 (6), pp. 1017-1054; Koehler, M.J., Mishra, P., What is technological pedagogical content knowledge (2009) Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, 9 (1), pp. 60-70; Shulman, L., Knowledge and teaching (1987) Harvard Educational Review, 57 (1), pp. 1-22; Gudmundsdottir, S., Shulman, L., Pedagogical content knowledge in social studies (1987) Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research, 31 (2), pp. 59-70; Gess-Newsome, J., Pedagogical content knowledge: An introduction and orientation (2002) Contemporary Trends and Issues in Science Education, 6 (1), pp. 3-17; Miller, M.L., Pedagogical content knowledge (2007) Theoretical Frameworks for Research in Chemistry/science Education, pp. 88-106. , G.

Eight documents and fourteen models of engineering education were analysed using content analysis. In order to define the objectives and standards of engineering education in Iran, common characteristics of the selected documents and models were identified. With regard to the results of the content analysis of these documents, twenty-four objectives in five categories for engineering education were determined. These categories include: knowledge and reasoning in technical and engineering topics; personal skills and attitudes; professional and ethical skills and attitudes; interpersonal skills and attitudes; and skills for developing system, product, or process. In addition, based on the content analysis of fourteen models derived from international consortia and agreements, seven standards including twenty-seven requirements were identified for engineering education. These standards are: the philosophy and objectives of engineering education; the curriculum; the instructional space and facilities; the teaching-learning process; faculty members; students; and assessment and evaluation.","Content analysis; Educational objectives; Engineering education; Globalization; Standards and requirements","Content analysis; Educational objectives; Faculty members; Globalization; Interpersonal skills; Personal skills; Teaching-learning process; Curricula; Education computing; Standards; Engineering education","Cheng, Y.C., (2005) New Paradigm for Reengineering Education: Globalization, , Localization and Individualization, Springer, The Netherlands; Cheng, Y.C., (2002) New Paradigm of Borderless Education: Challenges, Strategies, and Implications for Effective Education Through Localization and Internationalization, , Invited keynote speech presented at the International Conference on Learning & Teaching, Hatyai, Thailand, 14-16 October; National Academy of Engineering, The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2004; National Academy of Engineering, Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2005; Oliveira, A., Lima, I., (2009) Implementation of An International Multidisciplinary Engineering Education Consortium, , http://soa.asee.org/paper/conference/paper-view.cfm?id=10010, Accessed 28 May 2011; Crawley, E.F., Malmqvist, J., Ostlund, S., Brodeur, D., (2007) Rethinking Engineering Education: The CDIO Approach, , Springer, New York; Engineering Education Research Colloquies, Special report: The research agenda for the new discipline of engineering education (2006) Journal of Engineering Education, 95 (4), pp. 259-261; Dym, C.L., Agogino, A.M., Eris, O., Frey, D.D., Leifer, L.J., Engineering design thinking teaching and learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 103-120; Bankel, J., Berggren, K., Engstrom, M., Wiklund, I., Crawley, E.F., Soderholm, D., Gaidi, K.E., Ostlund, S., Benchmarking engineering curricula with the CDIO syllabus (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (1), pp. 121-133; Grimson, J., Re-engineering the curriculum for the 21st century (2002) European Journal of Engineering Education, 27 (1), pp. 31-37; Apelian, D., The engineering profession in the 21st century: Educational needs and societal challenges facing the profession (2007) International Journal of Metal Casting, pp. 21-30. , Fall; Spinks, N., Silburn, N.L.J., Birchall, D.W., Making it all work: The engineering graduate of the future a UK perspective (2007) European Journal of Engineering Education, 32 (3), pp. 325-335; Sevindik, T., Akpinar, B., The effects of the changes in postmodern pedagogical paradigms on engineering education in Turkey (2007) European Journal of Engineering Education, 32 (5), pp. 561-571; Haghi, A.K., New visions in engineering education: Breaking from conventional models creative approaches (2006) Iranian Journal of Engineering Education, 7 (4), pp. 1-12. , (in Persian); Bahadori-Nejad, M., Namaki, A., Parallel engineering education at universities and industries (2008) Iranian Journal of Engineering Education, 10 (3), pp. 63-74. , (in Persian); Rahimi, G.H., Engineering education and future developments of the country (1999) Iranian Journal of Engineering Education, 1 (3), pp. 1-11. , (in Persian); Zhang, Y., Wildemuth, B.M., Qualitative analysis of content (2009) Applications of Social Research Methods to Questions in Information and Library Science, pp. 308-319. , B.

This study employed an experiment, a pre-test, and a post-test, with control group designs. Participants comprised 53 first semester electrical engineering undergraduate students, who are attending the Electrical Technology (ET101) module. Participants completed a set of pre-test and a set of post-test multiple choice questions, covering a two-unit syllabus after ten weeks of treatment. Results suggested that student within the PBL group outperformed their counterparts in knowledge acquisition of principles and procedures. However, students using the conventional approach performed much better in knowledge acquisition of concepts. In terms of the whole structure of concepts, principles, and procedures, PBL enhanced students' knowledge acquisition in the electrical engineering course, compared to the use of conventional approach. This study also discusses the implication of PBL within engineering education.","Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Knowledge acquisition; Problem based learning","Comparative studies; Control groups; Conventional approach; Electrical engineering course; Electrical technology; Engineering undergraduates; Multiple choice questions; Problem based learning; Traditional learning; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Knowledge acquisition; Technical presentations; Students","Wee, K.N.L., (2004) Jump Start Authentic Problem Based Learning, , Prentice Hall Pearson Education South Asia Pte.

To fill this gap, a student-centered active learning approach to teaching grant proposal writing is developed in the present study. This approach combines three types of active learning activities: thinkpair- share discussions and reflections, mock panel review, and student development of a full proposal. This approach was implemented and assessed in a grant proposal writing course in a Ph.D. in Engineering Education program at Utah State University. Questionnaire surveys were administered in two semesters to assess the effectiveness of this approach. The results show that, on a 5-point Likert-type scale with 1 representing the least effective and 5 representing the most effective, the mean scores of student responses are more than 4.00 for all three types of active learning activities. The mean scores on ''student development of a full proposal'' activities are the two highest mean scores in both semesters: 4.71 in one semester and 4.63 in another semester. This implies that the most effective method for students to learn how to develop grant proposals is learning by doing, i.e., each student develops a proposal of his/her own.","Grant proposal writing; Pedagogy; Ph.D. in engineering education; Students-centered active learning","Active Learning; Learning by doing; Pedagogy; Proposal writing; Questionnaire surveys; Student development; Student response; Student-centered active learning; Utah state universities; Engineering education; Teaching; Students","Grose, T.K., 21st century prof (2007) ASEE Prism, 16 (2), pp. 26-31; Matsumoto, E., Masters, C., Akyurtlu, A., Hill, D., Ivory, M., Regan, A., Tutumluer, E., Pfatteicher, S., The engineering education scholars program-Preparing a new generation of faculty (1998) Proceedings of the 1998 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Seattle, WA, June 29-July 3; Purdy, C., Evaluating the effectiveness of mentoring doctoral students for academic careers (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Louisville,KY,June 20-23, paper No. AC 2010-1668; Fournier-Bonilla, S.D., Watson, K., Malave, C., Fryond, J., Managing curricula change in engineering at TexasA & MUniversity (2001) International Journal of Engineering Education, 17 (3), pp. 222-235; (2012), http://www.abet.org, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Engineering Criteria 2000, ABET, Inc., Baltimore, MD (2000), accessed on 20 February; National Academy of Engineers, Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, Washington, DC (2005); Donnell, J.A., Aller, B.M., Alley, M., Kedrowicz, A.A., Why industry says that engineering graduates have poor communication skills: What the literature says (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, June 26-29, paper No. AC 2011-1503; Mohan, A., Merle, D., Jackson, C., Lannin, J., Nair, S.S., Professional skills in the engineering curriculum (2009) IEEE Transactions on Education, 53 (4), pp. 562-657; Wheeler, E., McDonald, R.L., Writing in engineering courses (2000) Journal of Engineering Education, 89, pp. 481-486; Baren, R., Teaching writing in required undergraduate engineering courses: A materials course example (1993) Journal of Engineering Education, 82 (1), pp. 59-61; Davis, M.T., Assessing technical communication within engineering contexts tutorial (2010) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 53, pp. 33-45; Linsky, E., Georgi, G., Integrated technical writing instruction in freshman engineering (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Salt Lake City, UT, June 20-23; Calvo, R.A., Ellis, R.A., Students' conceptions of tutor and automated feedback in professional writing (2010) Journal of Engineering Education, 99 (4), pp. 427-438; Ford, J.D., Riley, L.A., Integrating communication and engineering education: A look at curricula courses and support systems (2003) Journal of Engineering Education, 92 (4), pp. 325-328; Shih, M., Content-based approaches to teaching academic writing (1986) TESOL Quarterly, 20 (4), pp. 617-648; Jackson, D.J., Developing STEM educational grant proposals: Best practices (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Portland, OR, June 12-15; Weissmann, K.E., Proposal writing-an important skill in academic chemistry programs (1990) Journal of Chemical Engineering, 67 (2), pp. 110-112; Miner, J.T., Miner, L.E., (2008) Proposal Planning & Writing (Fourth Edition), , Greenwood Press, Santa Barbara, CA; Moeller, R.M., Christensen, D.M., System mapping: A genre field analysis of the National Science Foundation's grant proposal and funding process (2010) Technical Communication Quarterly, 19 (1), pp. 69-89; Anderson, G.L., Garg, D.P., Suggestions for skillful proposal writing (2001) Journal of Intelligent Systems and Structures, 12, pp. 409-414; Higgs Iii, C.F., Graham, S., Mattei, N.J., Development of new faculty: Summary of the NSF-CMS WEE workshop (2006) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 132 (2), pp. 133-137; Lyman, F.T., The responsive classroom discussion: The inclusion of all students (1981) Mainstreaming Digest, pp. 109-113. , A.

This paper compared undergraduate civil engineering curricula in Arab countries. A review of the course requirements at 31 universities located in 19 countries was presented. Only universities that follow the American credit hour system are included in the study. Specifically, the study addressed degree requirements related to science, mathematics, general education, free electives, English language, engineering fundamentals, computer proficiency, required civil engineering courses, and technical electives. The study showed that the considered curricula took either 4 or 5 years to complete. The number of credit hours was found to be as little as 131 and as large as 204 credits. The humanities, social science and foreign language requirements at traditional universities were usually very low, whereas the same requirements were almost a full-year of study at Western-style universities located in the same region. Some universities followed a track system, which provided for specialization in one of the various civil engineering disciplines. As a result, the curricula of such universities were loaded with a large number of obligatory technical courses. The Western style universities, on the other hand, were heavy on fundamentals, but gave the student more choices with regard to technical and free elective courses.","Civil engineering; Curriculum development; Education; General education; Professional registration; Technical electives","Arab countries; Civil engineering curricula; Course requirements; Curriculum development; Elective course; Engineering course; Engineering disciplines; Engineering fundamentals; Engineering professionals; English languages; Foreign language; General education; Professional registration; Technical course; Technical electives; Track systems; Traditional universities; Undergraduate curricula; Civil engineering; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Technical presentations; Societies and institutions","United Nations, Demographic Yearbook 2009-2010.

Purpose: This study investigates early adoption processes in detail in the context of an assessment instrument designed for use in capstone design courses. Research at this level of detail is needed to better understand adoption processes in general and to encourage spread of innovation in engineering education practice. Design/Method: Semistructured clinical interviews were conducted with the developers and users of the assessment instrument and the educators who were introduced to it in a workshop. These interviews were analyzed thematically with respect to the diffusion of innovations theory. Results: The qualitative, in-depth nature of the analysis revealed surprising diversity in the participants' perceptions of the assessment instrument. The most important features affecting their adoption were the participants' perceptions of its compatibility with their own and their institutions' values and goals. The complex and varied ways in which the participants were involved with capstone courses at their university were important in understanding their adoption decisions. Conclusion: The findings are analyzed in terms of the context in which they arose, and their transferability to other contexts is discussed.

There are few efforts to purposefully connect research findings on how people design with what teachers need to understand and do to help K-16 students improve their design capability and learn through design activities. Purpose: This paper connects and simplifies disparate findings from research on design cognition and presents a robust framework for a scholarship of design teaching and learning that includes misconceptions, learning trajectories, instructional goals, and teaching strategies that instructors need to know to teach engineering design effectively. Method: A scholarship of integration study was conducted that involved a meta-literature review and led to selecting and bounding students' design performances with appropriate starting points and end points, establishing key performance dimensions of design practices, and fashioning use-inspired tools that represent design pedagogical content knowledge for teachers. Results: The outcome of this scholarship of integration effort is the Informed Design Learning and Teaching Matrix that contains nine engineering design strategies and associated patterns that contrast beginning versus informed design behaviors, with links to learning goals and instructional approaches that aim to support students in developing their engineering design abilities. Conclusions: This paper's theoretical contribution is an emergent educational theory of informed design that identifies key performance dimensions relevant to K-16 engineering and STEM educational contexts. Practical contributions include the Informed Design Teaching and Learning Matrix, which is fashioned to help teachers do informed teaching with design tasks while developing their own design pedagogical content knowledge. © 2012 ASEE.","Engineering design; Pedagogical content knowledge; Scholarship of integration","Design performance; Educational context; Engineering design; Instructional goals; Learning trajectories; Pedagogical content knowledge; Performance dimensions; Undergraduate engineering educations; Engineering education; Integration; Students; Teaching; Design","Adams, J.L., (1986) Conceptual blockbusting: A guide to better ideas, , Reading, MA: Perseus Books; Adams, R.S., (2001) Cognitive processes in iterative design behavior, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation.

Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 813 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332, United States","Background: Capstone design courses seek to prepare engineering students for industry by challenging student teams to solve real-world problems. To improve this preparation, university programs have recently focused on creating multidisciplinary teams. However, there is limited quantitative evidence showing that multidisciplinary student engineering teams develop higher quality projects or are better prepared for the work force. Hypothesis: Students who take a multidisciplinary capstone design (MCD) course have better outcomes than monodisciplinary capstone students as measured by job placement and/or independent evaluation by industrial professionals of students' products. Methodology: A single treatment was administered to Georgia Tech capstone design students for one semester with three course conditions: (1) monodisciplinary biomedical, (2) monodisciplinary mechanical, or (3) multidisciplinary biomedical and mechanical engineering. After course completion, students' cumulative GPA, job placement, and design exposition score were obtained and analyzed. This analysis used a generalized linear model for the exposition score and a logistic model for job placement outcomes. Results: A general linear model showed that all students who took the MCD course, regardless of major, produced an engineering solution that was better than that of their monodisciplinary contemporaries as measured by external industry professionals. Logistic and multinomial regressions showed that the MCD course increased the odds of employment significantly for biomedical engineering students. Conclusions: In this preliminary investigation, the MCD teams' holistic performance in innovation, utility, analysis, proof of concept, and communication skills was superior to that of their monodisciplinary counterparts, and, on average, they were hired more frequently. © 2012 ASEE.","Capstone design course; Interdisciplinary; Multidisciplinary; Senior design; Undergraduate education","Capstone design course; Interdisciplinary; Multidisciplinary; Senior design; Undergraduate education; Biomedical engineering; Engineering education; Industry; Product design; Students; Curricula","(2010) Criteria for accrediting engineering programs, 2011-2012, , http://www.abet.org/eac-current-criteria/, ABET.

Little is known about how pre-adolescents begin to construct their earliest conceptions of engineering and potential career aspirations. Further, there is little research on measuring young learners' engineering identity development. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the development of the Engineering Identity Development Scale (EIDS), an instrument designed to assess elementary school students' identity development in engineering. This study describes a three-phase approach to item construction, administration, and the gathering of reliable and valid evidence for scores on the EIDS. Design/Method: Item construction and administration of the instrument were conducted, and tests of reliability (internal consistency) and validity (content and internal structure) of the EIDS's scores were undertaken. The EIDS was intended to include four factors: (1) academic identity, (2) school identity, (3) occupational identity, and 4) engineering aspirations. Results: Findings indicate that two rather than four factors best describe young children's identity: academic and engineering career. Results provide initial support for score reliability and validity of the EIDS. Conclusion: The reliability and validity evidence support the proposed use of the EIDS instrument. Recommendations for infusing EIDS into science and engineering education and into research related to gender, identity, and learning in science and engineering education are suggested. © 2012 ASEE.","Elementary; Engineering; Identity","Educational research; Elementary; Engineering careers; Identity; Internal consistency; Professional engineerings; Reliability and validity; Science and engineering; Engineering; Engineering education; Instruments; Professional aspects; Reliability; Engineering research","Baker, D., The influence of role-specific self-concept and sex-role identity on career choices in science (1987) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 24 (8), pp. 739-756; Bartlett, M.S., A note on the multiplying factors for various chi square approximations (1954) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 16, pp. 296-298; Brickhouse, N., Eisenhart, M., Tonso, K., Forum identity politics in science education: Identity, politics, learning, and academic success (2006) Cultural Studies in Science Education, 1 (2), pp. 309-324; Brown, B., Discursive identity: Assimilation into the culture of science and its implications for minority students (2004) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41 (8), pp. 810-834; Brown, B., Reveles, J., Kelly, G., Scientific literacy and discursive identity: A theoretical framework for understanding science education (2005) Science Education, 89, pp. 779-802; Capobianco, B.M., (2010) Teachers' attempts at integrating engineering education in the elementary science classroom, , January A paper presentation at the annual meeting for the Association of Science Teacher Education, Sacramento, CA; Capobianco, B.M., Undergraduate women engineering their professional identities (2006) Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering, 12 (2), pp. 1-24; Capobianco, B.M., Osburn, K., (2005) How female undergraduate students ""engineer"" their professional identities, , April, A paper presentation at the annual meeting for the National Association for Research in Science Teaching, Dallas, TX; Capobianco, B.M., Habashi, M., Diefes-Dux, H., Generating measures for engineering identity development (2009) Proceedings of the ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, , October 18-21, 2009, San Antonio, TX; Carlone, H.B., Johnson, A., Understanding the science experiences of successful women of color: Science identity as an analytic lens (2007) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 44 (8), pp. 1187-1218; Case, J.M., Marshall, D., The ""No Problem"" discourse model: Exploring an alternative way of researching student learning (2008) International Journal of Educational Research, 47 (3), pp. 200-207; Comrey, A.L., Lee, H.B., (1992) A first course in factor analysis, , Hillsdale, N.J.: Erlbaum; Erikson, E.H., (1968) Identity: Youth and crisis, , New York: Norton; Faulkner, W., 'Nuts and bolts and people': Gender-troubled engineering identities (2007) Social Studies of Science, 37 (3), pp. 331-356; Finney, S.J., DiStefano, C., Non-normal and categorical data in structural equation modeling (2006) Structural equation modeling: A second course, pp. 269-314. , G.

The canal is used as an educational resource for teaching the master course Real-Time Control of Irrigation Canals. The prime educational objective of this course is that graduate students interested in building a professional career in water management, are trained to acquire skills that are essential in the development of automation projects for real irrigation canals. As supported by students' answers to an evaluation survey, using the experimental flume allows them to not only experience the involved hydraulics concepts, but also to be introduced in a hands-on manner to the necessary steps required to face any control system design process: modeling the system, designing the controller, testing the control system by simulation, and implementing them in real time. The theoretical background on dynamics and control supporting all these steps is not usually included in a civil engineering curriculum, and thus using the canal as a teaching resource is a better way of introducing future professional civil engineers to new technologies, making a perfect bridge between the classroom and practical activities on real canal facilities. The experience presented in this paper can be easily extrapolated to other disciplines complementing a classical civil engineering curriculum. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Automatic control; Control education; Educational resources; Irrigation canals; Teaching strategies; Water management","Automation project; Civil engineering curricula; Civil engineers; Control education; Dynamics and control; Educational objectives; Educational resource; Graduate students; In-buildings; Master course; ON dynamics; Professional careers; Real time; Scale models; Systems dynamics; Teaching resources; Teaching strategy; Automation; Control; Control systems; Dynamics; Employment; Engineering education; Engineers; Hydraulic structures; Irrigation canals; Real time control; Students; Teaching; Water management; Civil engineering","Aguilar, J.V., Langarita, P., Linares, L., Rodellar, J.J., Automatic control of flows and levels in an irrigation canal (2009) IEEE Trans.

This paper focuses on the question of how engineering students perceive the strategy of integrating creativity training into a PBL curriculum. A total of 20 medialogy students in the training programme were interviewed. The data shows that the training programme was thought useful and students get benefits such as gaining project work skills, creative concepts and confidence of being creative. However, limitations of the programme show that only five days of training did not fit the requirements of learning skills in PBL. So the supervisors are suggested to offer more creativity techniques and process engagement to move projects forward. © 2012 Copyright SEFI.","creativity training; engineering education; Problem and Project-Based Learning","Aalborg University; Denmark; Learning skills; Problem- and project-based learning; Project work; Training programmes; Curricula; Engineering education; Students; Personnel training","Amabile, T.M., The social psychology of creativity: a componential conceptualization (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45 (2), pp. 356-357; Amabile, T.M., (1996) Creativity in context, , Boulder, CO: Westview Press; Baumard, P., (1999) Tacit knowledge in organizations, , London: Sage; Brenner, M.E., Interviewing in educational research (2006) Hand book of complementary methods in education research, pp. 357-370. , In: Green J.

Specifically, the paper addresses students' responses to an initial design activity involving bridge construction, which was implemented at the end of seventh grade. This paper also addresses how students created their bridge designs and applied these in their bridge constructions; their reflections on their designs; their reflections on why the bridge failed to support increased weights during the testing process; and their suggestions on ways in which they would improve their bridge designs. The present findings include identification of six, increasingly sophisticated levels of illustrated bridge designs, with designs improving between the classroom and homework activities of two focus groups of students. Students' responses to the classroom activity revealed a number of iterative design processes, where the problem goals, including constraints, served as monitoring factors for students' generation of ideas, design thinking and construction of an effective bridge. © 2012 Copyright SEFI.","bridge construction; engineering design processes; mathematics and science education; middle school","Bridge constructions; Bridge design; Classroom activity; Design thinking; Engineering design process; First year; Focus groups; Initial design; Iterative design; Longitudinal study; Middle school; Science education; Testing process; Design; Engineering education; Students; Bridges","Borgford-Parnell, J., Deibel, K., Atman, C.J., From engineering design research to engineering pedagogy: bringing research results directly to the students (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (4), pp. 748-759; Cunningham, C.M., Hester, K., Engineering is elementary: an engineering and technology curriculum for children Proceedings of the 2007 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition, Washington, DC: American Society for Engineering Education; Dawes, L., Rasmussen, G., Activity and engagement-keys in connecting engineering with secondary school students (2007) Australasian Journal of Engineering Education, 13 (1), pp. 13-20; Erickson, F., Qualitative research methods for science education (1998) International handbook of science education (Part 2), pp. 1155-1173. , In: Fraser B.

A number of studies have shown that both students and professionals in this field write most discipline-specific genres collaboratively. Despite its centrality, CW in engineering is still an under-researched area with very few empirical studies on how it happens as situated practice. This article reports on a study that used a variety of data sets as its empirical base to examine CW in four schools of the faculty of engineering at a university in the UK. It also reports on the views of CW in the workplace that lecturers involved in industry hold. The article aims at contributing to the understanding of CW in engineering by identifying its role, nature and dynamics. It also examines pedagogical implications resulting from the study with a view to making a contribution to developments in writing in engineering education. The article finishes by making a number of recommendations for future research. © 2012 Copyright SEFI.","collaborative writing; engineering education; models of collaborative writing; nature and dynamics of collaborative writing","Collaborative writing; Data sets; Empirical studies; Undergraduate education; Dynamics; Engineering education; Teaching; Research","Alley, M., (2000) The craft of editing: A guide for managers, scientists and engineers, , New York: Springer; Barton, D., (2007) Literacy, lives and learning, , London: Routledge; Bazerman, C., Prior, P., (2003) What writing does and how it does it: An introduction to analyzing texts and textual practices, , New York: Routledge; Bracewell, R.J., Witte, S.P., Tasks, ensembles, and activity: linkages between text production and situation of use in the workplace (2003) Written Communication, 20 (4), pp. 511-559; Childs, P.R.N., (2004) Mechanical design, , 2, Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann; Gibson, I.S., Assessment criteria for undergraduate project work in engineering design (1998) European Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (3), pp. 389-395; Gimenez, J., Beyond the academic essay: discipline-specific writing in nursing and midwifery (2008) Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 7 (3), pp. 151-164; Gooch, J.C., The dynamics and challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration: a case study of 'Cortical Depth of Bench' in group proposal writing (2005) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 48 (2), pp. 177-190; Gygi, K., Zachry, M., Productive tensions and the regulatory work of genres in the development of an engineering communication workshop in a transnational corporation (2010) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 24 (3), pp. 358-381; Henderson, P., de Silva, N., A narrative approach to collaborative writing: a business process model [online] , pp. 23-27. , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.62.8495, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS), Available at: [Accessed 13 May 2012]; Hyland, K., Specificity revisited: how far should we go now?

Existing questionnaires have largely assumed the existence of these constructs; however, in a recent study Case and Marshall (2004) described two additional context-specific approaches to learning in engineering. The current study examines approaches to learning in a similar, but not identical educational context. Academically successful students adopted either a conceptual deep approach or a procedural deep approach, whereas their less academically successful peers resorted to a procedural surface approach. This study confirms constructs identified by Case and Marshall (2004); however, a much larger student sample would be necessary to generalise current findings.

We are witnessing the growing importance of biomedical engineering (BME). It leads to increasing needs for development of effective education in BME on the one side, and development of different models and simulation tools for both education and medical purposes on the other hand. BME is a highly interdisciplinary field, influenced by various other engineering and medical fields. This article describes the instrumentation, technique and the results in development of 3D parametric model of human spine and its kinematics using 3D computer aided modeling and simulation. Based on 3D parametric model of spine, software for simulation and visualization of scoliosis (deformation of spine) is also developed.

Furthermore, a case study workshop entitled 'Where is the Railway?' is presented detailing performed activities, results and the evaluation. Positive and negative aspects of designcentric approach to teaching/learning are discussed from the students' and the teachers' viewpoint. The balance of project preparation and management with the freedom in creating project's contents and results is stressed. Finally, the role of universities is accentuated through choice of locations, buildings and institutions involved in the workshops. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Design-centric education; Interdisciplinary engineering education; Project based learning; Student workshops","Croatia; Project based learning; Project preparation; Teaching/learning; Civil engineering; Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Students","(2005) The Higher Education Academy-Engineering Subject Centre: Engineering Subject Centre Guide: Assessment of Learning Outcomes; (2008), http://www.bie.org/index.php/site/PBL/pbl_handbook, 09.10; Katavic, M., Dukan, P., (1989) Gradevinski Inz?enjer Kao Menadz ?Er, pp. 767-779. , 3. jugoslavenski simpozij Organizacija gradenja, Cavtat; Katavic, M., Ceric, A., Imac, M.S., In the pursuit of a Perfect Project Manager (2002) 2nd SENET Conference on Project Management, Cavtat, pp. 73-83; Dolacek-Alduk, Z., Loncar Vickovic, S., Stober, D., (2011) Projektna Nastava U Obrazovanju Gradevinskih Inz?enjera, , Gradevinski fakultet Osijek, Osijek; Aslin, P.S., (2005) Stanovnis?tvo Baranje: Obiljez?ja i Procesi, , Meridijani, Samobor; Buselic, J., (1975) Ceste i Mostovi U Hrvatskoj: Supstitucija Ukinutih Nerentabilnih Z?eljeznickih Pruga, pp. 161-167. , Republicki fond za ceste i potpisnici Sporazuma o financiranju i koris?tenju monografije, Zagreb; Stoljeca Belja, T., (1986) Zbronik Radova, Urednik Dus?an Calic, , JAZU, Zavod za znanstveni rad, Osijek; Maddocks, A., EASIMAP: A coherent approach to the assessment of learning outcomes on engineering degree programmes (2007) Engineering Education, 2 (2), pp. 26-32; Loncar-Vickovic, S., Dolacek-Alduk, Z., Ishodi ucenja- prirucnik za sveucilis?ne nastavnike (2010) Sveucilis?te J.

Empirical Bayesian analysis comprising Exploratory Factor Analysis and Bayesian Con?rmatory Strategies is used to deeply mine and draw inferences from relatively small sample sizes. This research con?rms Biggs' suggestion that the tendency of education to erode towards Shallow Learning may be addressed through curriculum design that constructively aligns student choices with deep engagement. Students in subjects designed for pull-learning do appreciate the constructive alignment of their choices with deep engagement.

A well-constructed design project may excite the students and enhance their motivation and learning experience signi?cantly. At the same time, a poorly constructed design project may in fact reduce student motivation. Despite the importance of design experiences, there currently is a lack of systematic frameworks to help instructors in core engineering courses. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a conceptual framework based on the expectancy value theory of achievement motivation. The expectancy value theory is based on two important factors that a?ect students' task-related motivation: expectancy, which is an individual's belief about how well he/she will do on upcoming tasks, and values, which are the reasons/incentives for completing a task. The framework is illustrated using a Systems Dynamics course taught at Washington State University.

These organizations require recent graduates to have a strong handle on environmental issues related to new product development. Since mechanical engineering curricula are saturated with courses covering a broad spectrum of engineering fundamentals, there is little room to develop a separate course to teach principles related to sustainable product design. This manuscript presents a novel method for teaching Design for Environment (DfE) strategies within a mechanical engineering product design course through the use of expert critiques. The results from this study indicate that integration of a critique based module within an existing design project is an e?ective medium for teaching sustainable product design. Also, receiving feedback in the form of disruptive design critiques breeds innovative design modi?cations that lower the energy and carbon footprints of the design across multiple lifecycle stages. More importantly, the results indicate that after participating in this teaching module, students are more likely to apply the learned DfE principles within academia and industry. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Contextual learning; Design for environment; Design learning; Project critique","Broad spectrum; Contextual learning; Design for Environment; Design learning; Design projects; Engineering fundamentals; Engineering organizations; Engineering product design; Environmental issues; Innovative design; Life cycle stages; New product development; Project critique; Project-based; Recent graduates; Sustainable products; Teaching module; Carbon footprint; Engineering education; Mechanical engineering; Product design; Sustainable development; Teaching; Curricula","(2010), http://memagazine.asme.org/web/Sustainable_Design_Trend.cfm, Accessed 6 June; Azapagic, A., Perdan, S., Shallcross, D., How much do engineering students know about sustainable development? the findings of an international survey and possible implications for the engineering curriculum (2005) European Journal of Engineering Education, 30 (1), pp. 1-19; Huntzinger, D.N., Hutchins, M.J., Gierke, J.S., Sutherland, J.W., Enabling sustainable thinking in undergraduate engineering education (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (2), pp. 218-230; Allen, D., Allenby, B., Bridges, M., Crittenden, J., Davidson, C., Hendrickson, C., Matthews, S., Pijawka, D., (2008) Benchmarking Sustainability Engineering Education, , Final Report EPA Grant X3-83235101-0; Fuchs, V.J., Mihelcic, J.R., Engineering education for international sustainability curriculum design under the sustainable futures model (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 ASEE North Midwest Sectional Conference, , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, October 9-12; Mulder, F.K., Engineering curricula in sustainable development.

The most distinctive feature in DHEis that all students are required to select two disciplines for their major among three major disciplines, which are; (i) Integrated Industrial Design, (ii) A?ective and Human Factors Engineering, and (iii) Engineering and Systems Design. The DHE's major system of the new design-engineering program was developed to foster the next generation designers and engineers, having talent in not only creative ideation but also systematic realization. In this paper, we ?rst describe the founding background, educational rationale and curriculum structure. The curriculum includes students' selective curriculum paths based on their talent and aptitude; collaborative education structure as well as multidisciplinary team-based project courses taught by groups of instructors from di?erent disciplines. Then, the new design-engineering education program is assessed in both quantitative and qualitative ways. The ?rst step of the research is to assess the students' core competencies required in design-engineering combined program by using K-CESA (Korea Colligate Essential Skill Assessment) with 32 students enrolled in DHE. Aphenomenological study is also conducted to understand the problems in the current program via in-depth interviews with representative students in DHE. Also, a creative transdisciplinary short course for students from other universities with various majors (e.g., engineering and design) was o?ered and tested to evaluate the combined educational system. Finally, we propose the direction for curriculum improvement and follow-up assessment plans, including assessments for students and faculty. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Combined design and engineering education; Education curriculum; Interdisciplinary education","Assessment plan; Collaborative education; Combined design; Core competencies; Curriculum improvement; Curriculum structure; Education programs; Educational systems; In-depth interviews; Interdisciplinary education; Multiple disciplines; Science and Technology; Short course; Skill assessment; Team-based projects; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Human engineering; Product design; Teaching; Students","Bonjour, E., Micaëlli, J., Hlaoittinun, O., Deniaud, I., Design and core competency, the missing links (2007) 4th IFAC Conference on Management and Control of Production and Logistics, , Sibiu, Romania; Subrahmanian, E., Westerberg, A., Talukdar, S., Garrett, J., Jacobson, A., Paredis, C., Amon, C., Turk, A., Integrating social aspects and group work aspects in engineering design education (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (1 SPEC.), pp. 75-80; Kurfess, T.R., Producing the modern engineer (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (1 SPEC.), pp. 118-123; Hirsch, P., Shwom, B., Anderson, J., Colgate, J.E., Jacobson, S., Kelso, D., Lake, J., Yarnoff, C., Collaborating with design professionals and industry to build a design course for freshmen (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (1 SPEC.), pp. 103-109; Evans, R., Design: A theory of design (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (1), pp. 81-93; Kim, K., Lee, K., Two types of design approaches regarding industrial design and engineering design in product design (2010) International Design Conference -Design 2010, , Dubrovnik, Croatia; Bronet, F., Eglash, R., Gabriele, G., Hess, D., Kagan, L., Product design and innovation: Evolution of an interdisciplinary design curriculum (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (1 SPEC.), pp. 183-191; Talbot, D., (2011) The Problem with Design Education, , Technology Review; Daniels, M., Carbone, A., Hauer, A., Moore, D., Panel-illstructured problem solving in engineering education (2007) Frontiers in Education Conference-Global Engineering: Knowledge Without Borders, , Opportunities Without Passports, 2007.

A previous meta-analysis introduced a distinction between three levels of knowledge structure to be assessed (understanding of concepts, understanding of principles, and application of these concepts and principles) and showed that, in medical education, problem-based learning only signi?cantly outperformed conventional learning on the 'understanding of principles' component. The purpose of this study is to compare the understanding of concepts, understanding of principles, and application of knowledge among engineering students before and after the introduction of a problem-and project-based curriculum (PBL). To achieve this, four cohorts of students (total N = 385), two of which had followed a lecture-based curriculum and two a PBL curriculum, completed a criterion-referenced test assessing the three levels of knowledge structure. It was found that students from the PBL curriculum outperformed students from the conventional curriculum, particularly on the application of knowledge. In conclusion, these results indicate that PBL can be e?ective in engineering education, but bring into question the generalizability of ?ndings from medical education to other curricula in higher education (especially when a project-based learning component is added). © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Achievement; Curriculum; Innovation; Learning; Skills","Achievement; Comparative studies; Higher education; Knowledge structures; Learning; Meta-analysis; Problem based learning; Project based learning; Project-based curriculum; Skills; Engineering education; Innovation; Medical education; Students; Curricula","Evensen, D.H., Hmelo, C.E., (2000) Problem-Based Learning: A Research Perspective on Learning Interactions, , Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ; Hmelo-Silver, C.E., Problem-based learning: What and how do students learn?

We present case studies of design-centric projects related to home automation systems in the Bachelor and Master of Science programmes. The preliminary results in laboratory conditions with Engineering students and professors show the e?ectiveness of the integration between engineering and the human factors disciplines. Moreover, it is shown how Engineering students understand the bene?ts of the Human-centred approach by using holistic models to develop new and innovative products. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Active methodologies; Human-centred design; Product design education","Active methodologies; Design Education; Engineering curriculum; Holistic model; Home automation systems; Innovative product; Laboratory conditions; Master of science; Curricula; Engineering education; Human engineering; Product design; Product development; Models","Toft, Y., Howard, P., Jorgensen, D., Human-centred engineers - A model for holistic interdisciplinary communication and professional practice (2003) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 31 (3), pp. 195-202. , DOI 10.1016/S0169-8141(02)00197-X, PII S016981410200197X; Schaefer, D., Panchal, J.H., Choi, S.-K., Mistree, F., Strategic design of engineering education for the flat world (2008) Int.

The need for the development of competencies raised an incremental interest in applying innovative approaches in Engineering Education. One of the methodologies used in this context is Project-Based Learning (PBL). At the University of Brasilia, a course degree in Production Engineering was created having as a main reference the Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach. The use of PBL implies a change of behavior of teachers who play a main role of facilitators of competencies development, and of the students, who learn in a collaborative way, working with others in teams. Students' working in team and developing a project during a semester will require e?ective coordination models. The objective of this paper is to propose a model of coordination among students' teams based on project management knowledge. Furthermore, a qualitative approach is applied to evaluate the application of this model during one semester. The results show that a coordination model for student teams developing projects is important to support their learning process, which is not solely dependent on students, as teachers/tutors have an important role before, during and at the end of the project. The tutor is especially important, as he/she is responsible for supporting the teams in several project management dimensions. This is an essential support for students to know how to manage the team, communicate, de?ne goals, carry out the activities on time, plan the milestones and understand the impact of their decisions. These competencies are also part of student learning and are an important part of engineering education. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Coordination of student teams; Design centric education; Project based learning; Project management in education","Change of behavior; Coordination model; Developing projects; Engineering learning; Engineering professionals; Essential support; Innovative approaches; Learning process; Project based learning; Project management process; Qualitative approach; Student learning; Student teams; Education computing; Engineering education; Production engineering; Project management; Teaching; Students","(2010) Challenges and Opportunities for Development, , UNESCO, Engineering: Issues, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Paris, France; Simon, H.A., (1996) The Sciences of the Artificial, , 3rd ed., Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press; Adams, R.S., Turns, J., Atman, C.J., Educating effective engineering designers: The role of reflective practice.

This technological evolution imposes, among others, a process evolution within the organizations, the information multiplication to be integrated and processed, an increase in competitions to respond faster to global needs, and an increasing demand for systems integration. As a result, CEprograms have an undeniable and constant necessity to evolve their curricula to keep up to date. We have de?ned, put into production, and validated a curricula design model based on competences to facilitate the design and implementation of CE programs. The frame for competence de?nition is stable, allowing a fast adaptation to the continuous change. The curricula design model turns around a set of competences de?ned in terms of the life cycle of problem resolutions, which is structured around projects.

Gaps are brainstormed and analyzed with reference to their importance. Reasons that may lead the newly graduated engineers not to succeed right from the beginning of their professional lives have also been evaluated. A comparison among the two subjects above was prepared, reviewed and analyzed. The in?uence of multidisciplinary, multicultural and complex environmental in?uences created in the current global business era is taken into account. The industry requirements in terms of what they expect to 'receive' from their engineers are evaluated and compared to the remaining of the study above. An innovative approach to current engineering education that utilizes traditional designcentric methodologies is then proposed, aggregating new disciplines to supplement the traditional engineering education. The solution encompasses the inclusion of disciplines from Human Sciences and Emotional Intelligence ?elds willing to better prepare the engineer of tomorrow to work in a multidisciplinary, globalized, complex and team working environment. A pilot implementation of such an approach is reviewed and conclusions are drawn from this educational project. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Aerospace design-centric; Human relations; Leadership; Team working in engineering","Aerospace design-centric; Educational projects; Emotional intelligence; Global business; Human relations; Human science; Innovative approaches; Leadership; Pilot implementation; Professional life; Team working; Engineering education; Engineers; Design","Young, T.M., Aircraft design education at universities: Benefits and difficulties (2000) Aircraft Design, 3 (4), pp. 207-215. , DOI 10.1016/S1369-8869(00)00014-8; Delicato, F.L., (2009) Relató Rio de Atividades-Curso 'Desenvolvimento Pessoal Para Engenheiros', , Universidade de Sao Paulo-USP; Mcmasters, J.H., (2003) Influencing Engineering Education .

We noticed that students have huge interesting and active attitudes about experiment. In this paper, we introduced the experiment of point-to-point movement, typically in manufacture industry, for the students with no any control knowledge. Based on the principles of traditional rotary motors, students are guided to design a linear motor platform. The linear motor moves from zero position to a desired position. Students are requested to do their best to design a controller based on their intuitions and experiment results. The results and problems occurred will encourage students to study control knowledge and back to solve the problems. This practice-oriented intuitive approach (POIA) o?ers an alternative to learning control theory from concrete experience, so students can grasp knowledge and relate control concepts to simple events. A case study is provided, which involves a team of ?ve undergraduates with a project named linear motor driven inverted pendulum and controller design sponsored through the Undergraduate Research Program (URP) by China Agricultural University.

The challenge for educators everywhere is to nurture world-class solution developers, despite local constraints in available resources or organization, by leveraging native strength and opportunities. At the Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology (XAUAT) in China, proposed reforms towards a design-centric learning environment featuring multidisciplinary student teams for open-ended design projects from current public needs draw upon the existing academic specialties of this institution, and apply new ways of approaching education to enhance the existing Chinese undergraduate engineering curriculum. A design process is proposed that approaches those in professional ?rms, adjusted to maximize student acquisition of interpersonal (teamwork, con?ict management, and negotiation), communication (written, oral, and graphical), and project management and design skills. The example institution's academic strength and industry connections suggest a number of possible projects, of which a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is chosen as a representative example allowing the detailed working out of a schedule of student deliverables (in this case, a feasibility study and a preliminary design) and a description of the learning process, starting with initial lectures and ?eld trips, continuing through the discipline-by-discipline development of the project design, and culminating in reports and drawings evaluated on ability to satisfy the needs of the client by both faculty and experts from industry. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Capstone design; Design-centric education; Engineering education; Inter-disciplinary design; Waste water plant design","Capstone course; Capstone design; Chinese universities; Creative engineering; Design process; Design projects; Design skills; Feasibility studies; ICT management; Learning environments; Learning process; Local constraints; Preliminary design; Project designs; Student teams; Undergraduate engineering; Wastewater treatment plants; Water plant; Design; Engineering education; Project management; Students; Teaching; Curricula","(2011) Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, , http://www.moe.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_1668/201101/ 113656.html, Accessed 15 August; (2011) China Education and Research Network, , http://career.eol.cn/html/c/jy/index01.shtml, Accessed 1 December; (2011) Real World Real Learning,IMDWorld Competitiveness Yearbook 2010, , http://www.imd.ch/research/publications/wcy/upload/scoreboard.pdf, Accessed 6 January; (2011), http://www.zaobao.com/forum/pages2/forum_lx100217b.shtml, Accessed 18 August; (2011), http://www.chinanews.com/hb/2011/04-26/2998554.shtml, Accessed 18 August; (2011), http://news.xinhuanet.com/edu/2009-04/18/content_11210201.htm, Accessed 18 August; (2011), http://www.chinacdio.cn, Accessed 2 June; Dutson, A.J., Todd, R.H., Magleby, S.P., Sorensen, C.D., Areview of literature on teaching engineering design through project-oriented capstone courses (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86, pp. 17-28; Lovas, C.M., Capstone engineering design: A history (1994) Proceedings, Advances in Capstone Education Conference, pp. 103-108. , Brigham Young University, Provo, UT., Aug; National survey of engineering capstone design courses (2006) 2006 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, pp. 1-21. , Susannah Howe and Jessica Wilbarger 2005, Chicago, IL, June; Harrisberger, L., Heydinger, R., Seeley, J., Talburtt, M., (1976) Experiential Learning in Engineering Education, pp. 9-12. , American Society for Engineering Education, Suite 400, Washington, D.C., May; Wilbarger, J., Howe, S., Current practices in engineering capstone education: Further results from a 2005 nationwide survey The 36th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. T1E5-10. , San Diego, CA, October 200; (2011), http://cee.mit.edu/news/releases/2011/senior-bridge-design, Accessed 22 August; (2011), http://eeic.osu.edu/capstone, Accessed 20 August; (2011), http://capstone.byu.edu/about/history.php, Accessed 2 June; Magleby, S.P., Sorensen, C.D., Todd, R.H., Integrated Product and Process Design: A capstone Course in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (1992) Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 469-474. , West Lafayette, IN, September; (2011), http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ugrad/dcc/index.html, Accessed 2 August; Goldberg, J.R., Capstone design course-producing industry-ready biomedical engineers (2007) Morgan and Claypool, pp. 41-43; (2011), http://env.people.com.cn/GB/14889848.html, Accessed 20 June; (2004) Municipal Public Works Design Depth of Documentation Requirements, , Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's Republic of China, Beijing","Lu, J.-S.; Xi'An University of Architecture and Technology, Yanta Road 13, Xi'an, 710055, Shaanxi province, China; email: lujinsuo@xauat.edu.cn",0949149X,,,"English","Int.

Remote laboratories provide online workbenches unconstrained by neither temporal nor geographical considerations and allow an interactive learning that maintains student attention. Recently, remote laboratories have been developed at multiple universities and adopted in engineering education. Furthermore, some of these laboratories are replicated at many universities such as the electronic circuit's remote labs: NetLab, VISIR, and labs based on NI ELVIS II. This was the commence of a new mainstream which advocates a better remodeling of those laboratories to allow their allocation, sharing among universities, and their communication with other heterogeneous systems, e.g., Learning Management Systems (LMS). In this context, numerous sharable educational architectures for remote labs integration have emerged such as LiLa, Lab 2 go, ISILab, DCL, WebLab Deusto, iLab (ISA), and Labshare (Sahara). This paper reports on the emerging solutions for remote laboratories implementation and deployment in engineering education in an efficient way. The paper discusses different integration scenarios pointing out features, limitations, and upcoming challenges. © 2012 IEEE.","distance education; elearning; online learning; remote laboratory","Heterogeneous systems; Interactive learning; Learning management system; Multiple disciplines; Online learning; Remote laboratories; Remote labs; Distance education; Engineering education; Laboratories; Network architecture; Societies and institutions; E-learning","Gomes, L., Bogosyan, S., Current Trends in Remote Laboratories (2009) Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on, 56, pp. 4744-4756; Gravier, C., Fayolle, J., Bayard, B., Ates, M., Lardon, J., State of the Art about Remote Laboratories Paradigms - Foundations of Ongoing Mutations (2008) International Journal of Online Engineering (IJOE), 4, pp. 19-25; Guimaraes, E.G., Cardozo, E., Moraes, D.H., Coelho, P.R., Design and Implementation Issues for Modern Remote Laboratories (2011) Learning Technologies, IEEE Transactions on, 4, pp. 149-161; Gustavsson, I., Nilsson, K., Zackrisson, J., Garcia-Zubia, J., Hernandez-Jayo, U., Nafalski, A., Nedic, Z., Hkansson, L., On Objectives of Instructional Laboratories, Individual Assessment, and Use of Collaborative Remote Laboratories (2009) Learning Technologies, IEEE Transactions on, 2, pp. 263-274; http://netlab.unisa.edu.au/index.xhtml, NetLab - The Online Remote Laboratory - Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Martín, S., Gil, C., Pesquera, A., Losada, P., Díaz, G., Castro, M., A New Node in the VISIR Community REV 2011 Proceedings, Brasov, Romania, 2011, , presented at the; Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Martin, S., Gil, C., Losada, P., Diaz, G., Castro, M., Remote laboratories for electrical & electronic subjects in new engineering grades (2011) Promotion and Innovation with New Technologies in Engineering Education (FINTDI), 2011, pp. 1-6; Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Martin, S., Gil, C., Pesquera, A., Losada, P., Diaz, G., Alves, G.R., VISIR deployment in undergraduate engineering practices (2011) Global Online Laboratory Consortium Remote Laboratories Workshop (GOLC), 2011 First, pp. 1-7; Educational Design and Prototyping Platform, , http://www.ni.com/nielvis/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; Nakazinga, P., Karumuna, P., Asiimwe, A.T., Mwikirize, C., Musasizi, P.I., Tickodri-Togboa, S.S., Butime, J., Katumba, A., An Interactive Control Systems Online Laboratory Utilizing NI ELVIS IITM and the Quanser 010 DC Motor Control Trainer REV 2011 Proceedings, Brasov, Romania, 2011, , presented at the; Mwikirize, C., Asiimwe, A.T., Musasizi, L., Namuswa, V., Nakasozi, M.D., Mugga, C., Katumba, A., Musasizi, P.I., Development of Online Laboratories for Modulation and Combinational Logic Circuit Analysis Using NI ELVIS II&#153; Platform (2010) Information Technology: New Generations (ITNG), 2010 Seventh International Conference on, pp. 1069-1073; Popović, B., Popović, N., Mijić, D., Stankovski, S., Ostojić, G., Remote control of laboratory equipment for basic electronics courses: A LabVIEW-based implementation (2011) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, pp. n/a-n/a; Samuelsen, D.A.H., Graven, O.H., Low Cost Implementation of Remote Lab with Large Number of Configurations for a BJT Amplifier (2011) International Journal of Online Engineering (IJOE), 7, pp. 31-36; Maier, C., Niederstätter, M., Lab2go - A Repository to Locate Online Laboratories (2010) International Journal of Online Engineering (IJOE), 6, pp. 12-17; Lab2go: The Semantically Enriched Repository of Online Labs, , http://www.lab2go.net/, Retrieved December 30, 2011, from; http://dublincore.org/, Retrieved January 1, 2012; Learning Object Metadata (LOM), , http://ltsc.ieee.org/wg12/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; The Friend of A Friend (FOAF) Project, , http://www.foaf-project.org/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; Protégé - An Ontology Editor and Knowledge-base Framework, , http://protege.stanford.edu/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; OntoWiki, , http://ontowiki.net/Projects/OntoWiki, Retrieved Jaunuary 1, 2012, from; LRN Project Site, , http://openacs.org/projects/dotlrn/, Retrieved January 1, 2011, from; Collaboration and Learning - For Educators by Educators, , http://sakaiproject.org/, Retrieved January 1, 2011, from; Ferreira, J.M., Cardoso, A.M., A Moodle extension to book online labs (2005) iJOE International Journal on Online Engineering, 1; Uran, S., Hercog, D., Jezernik, K., Remote Control Laboratory with Moodle Booking System (2007) Industrial Electronics, 2007.

In response to these needs, the Performance-Centered Adaptive Curriculum for Employment Needs (PAC) project was launched in order to develop business adaptive and employment and labor market oriented master degree programs for computer, electronics, and fiber-optics engineering. The project aims to input business and employment into curriculum development. Likewise, it considers concrete and specific new standards of industry at national and regional level, not only in terms of formal qualifications but also in terms of detailed new skills requirements and competences. Thus, it will be able to foster employment by preparing qualified professional profiles in a particular occupation. The project provides virtual mobility of students and teachers by developing open educational resources on-line within the framework DIPSEIL (Distributed Internet-Based Performance Support Environment for Individualized Learning) which is released in five languages to organize different courses from available modules and tasks for performance according to the needs of a specific job place. These educational resources comprise innovative ICT-based learning content, services, pedagogies and practice for lifelong learning and vocational training. The PAC project is based on a partnership between European universities and enterprises and it supports progress towards European-wide certification of qualifications. In this session, the project is presented outlining the main objectives and the contributions carried out by each partner. © 2012 IEEE.","Adaptive Curriculum; Employment Needs; Engineering Education; Performance-Centered; Training","Curriculum development; Educational contents; Educational resource; Engineering curriculum; European Higher Education Area; European universities; Internet based; Labor markets; Learning contents; Life long learning; Master degree; Open educational resources; Performance support; Performance-Centered; Regional levels; Virtual mobility; Vocational training; Curricula; Employment; Engineering education; Industry; Information technology; Personnel training; Teaching; E-learning","http://pac.dipseil.net/, website, accessed on November 15th, 2011; http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/, website, accessed on November 15th, 2011","Mileva, N.; Plovdiv UniversityBulgaria; email: nevena.mileva@gmail.com",,9781467324861,,"English","Proc. - Technol.

They teach the student the basics of electronic circuit's components and the adjustment of electrical instruments, and allow him to wire and build circuits in order to realize and monitor measurements. Unfortunately, and despite the importance of this type of practices, they are not usually available at many universities owing to geographical, cost, and time constraints. With the evolving of communication and computer technologies, and the advent of E-Learning, it was possible to vanish these constrains by the powerful tools provided by E-Learning, among them the remote laboratories. Thus, recently, many universities have shifted from traditional hands-on laboratories to remote laboratories in order to tackle these constrains bringing fundamentals of electronic circuits practices on-line to students. This has allowed students to access the lab at any time and from anywhere and to design, wire and measure electronic circuits remotely, achieving a significant increase in the lab availability and cost reduction. This paper reports on the current trends in remote laboratories for fundamentals of electronic circuits practices, pointing out significant projects such as Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR), NetLab, and remote labs based on NI ELVIS II, which have been successfully adopted at many universities and deployed in the electrical engineering curricula. The paper, also, addresses other common independent approaches based on Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) in combination with measurement and control environments, such as LabVIEW and MATLAB. © 2012 IEEE.","electronics; NetLab; NI ELVIS II; remote laboratory; VISIR","Computer technology; Current trends; Data acquisition system; LabViEW; Measurement and control; NetLab; Remote laboratories; Remote labs; Time constraints; Virtual instrument systems; VISIR; Electrical engineering; Electronic equipment; Engineering education; Laboratories; Societies and institutions; Students; Wire; E-learning","Gustavsson, I., Nilsson, K., Zackrisson, J., Garcia-Zubia, J., Hernandez-Jayo, U., Nafalski, A., Nedic, Z., Hkansson, L., On Objectives of Instructional Laboratories, Individual Assessment, and Use of Collaborative Remote Laboratories (2009) Learning Technologies, IEEE Transactions on, 2, pp. 263-274; NetLab - The Online Remote Laboratory - University of South Australia, , http://netlab.unisa.edu.au/index.xhtml, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; United States Home | Agilent, , http://www.home.agilent.com/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; National Instruments VISA, , http://www.ni.com/visa/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; NI LabVIEW - Improving the Productivity of Engineers and Scientists, , http://www.ni.com/labview/, Retrieved December 30, 2011, from; Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Martín, S., Gil, C., Pesquera, A., Losada, P., Díaz, G., Castro, M., A New Node in the VISIR Community The REV 2011 Proceedings, Brasov, Romania, 2011, , presented at; Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Martin, S., Gil, C., Losada, P., Diaz, G., Castro, M., Remote laboratories for electrical & electronic subjects in new engineering grades (2011) Promotion and Innovation with New Technologies in Engineering Education (FINTDI), 2011, pp. 1-6; Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Martin, S., Gil, C., Pesquera, A., Losada, P., Diaz, G., Alves, G.R., VISIR deployment in undergraduate engineering practices Global Online Laboratory Consortium Remote Laboratories Workshop (GOLC), 2011 First, 2011, pp. 1-7; PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI), , http://www.pxisa.org/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; Test, Measurement, and Embedded Systems, , http://spain.ni.com/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; PC/104 Consortium, , http://www.pc104.org/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; http://www.ivifoundation.org/, Retrieved Januay 1, 2012, from; Hernández-Jayo, U., García-Zubía, J., A Remote and Reconfigurable Analog Electronics Laboratory based on IVI an LXI Technologies The REV 2011 Proceedings, Brasov, Romania, 2011, , presented at; LXI Consortium - Home, , http://www.lxistandard.org/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; NI ELVIS: Educational Design and Prototyping Platform, , http://www.ni.com/nielvis/, Retrieved December 30, 2011, from; Mahata, S., Maiti, A., Maiti, C.K., Cost-effectiveweb-based electronics laboratory using NI MultiSim, LabVIEW and ELVIS II The Technology for Education (T4E), 2010 International Conference on Mumbai, 2010, , presented at; Ayodele, K.P., Kehinde, L.O., Jonah, O., Ilori, O., Ajayi, E.O.B., Osasona, O.O., Development of an Operational Amplifier Virtual Laboratory based on iLab Architecture and NI ELVIS The Proceedings of the ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Pittsburgh, 2008, , presented at; Sousa, N., Alves, G.R., Gericota, M.G., An Integrated Reusable Remote Laboratory to Complement Electronics Teaching (2010) Learning Technologies, IEEE Transactions on, 3, pp. 265-271; Ursutiu, D., Iordache, D., Cotfas, P.A., Cotfas, D.T., Samoila, C., LabVIEW controlled NI-ELVIS web interface The Remote Eng. & Virtual Instrumentation (REV), Brasov, Romania, 2011, , presented at; Popović, B., Popović, N., Mijić, D., Stankovski, S., Ostojić, G., Remote control of laboratory equipment for basic electronics courses: A LabVIEW-based implementation (2011) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, pp. n/a-n/a; Samuelsen, D.A.H., Graven, O.H., Low Cost Implementation of Remote Lab with Large Number of Configurations for a BJT Amplifier (2011) International Journal of Online Engineering (iJOE), 7, pp. 31-36; Taneja, A., Kushwah, A., Gupta, A., Vats, V.B., TeleLab - A Remote Monitoring and Control System (2007) International Journal of Online Engineering (iJOE), 3; Costa, R.J., Alves, G.R., Experimenting through the Web a Linear Variable Differential Transformer (2006) International Journal of Online Engineering (iJOE), 2. , March 28; Harward, V.J., Del Alamo, J.A., Lerman, S.R., Bailey, P.H., Carpenter, J., DeLong, K., Felknor, C., Zych, D., The iLab Shared Architecture: A Web Services Infrastructure to Build Communities of Internet Accessible Laboratories (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE, 96, pp. 931-950; iLabs, , http://icampus.mit.edu/ilabs/, Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; Hardison, J.L., DeLong, K., Bailey, P.H., Harward, V.J., Deploying interactive remote labs using the iLab Shared Architecture Frontiers in Education Conference, 2008.

Moreover, they augment the learning outcomes by strengthening the understanding of scientific concepts and theories. Unfortunately, there exist a wide gap between the engineering educational curricula and the industrial real-world owing to the lack of experimentation availability. This is due to high cost and administration burdens that have hindered the adoption of practical sessions causing a significant decline in experimentation within engineering education. Recently, with the advent and exploitation of computer and communication technologies, remote laboratories have broadly proliferated among many universities. Remote laboratories provide on-line ubiquitous workbenches unconstrained by neither temporal nor geographical considerations and allow an interactive learning environment that maintains student attention. In this context, hundreds of remote laboratories for industrial electronics applications have been developed and numerous technologies have emerged in order to facilitate their construction and implementation. This paper reports on state-of-art remote laboratories for industrial electronics applications. and their design stages. The paper addresses many solutions in the development and the design stages, along with cutting edge technologies involved. This is in order to foster remote laboratories adoption within industrial electronics disciplines and hence, increase the industrial competencies in engineering education. © 2012 IEEE.","distance education;

Videotaped classroom sessions and teacher interviews were analyzed to understand the subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge the teachers used and developed as they introduced the eight steps of the engineering design process (from content standards for the state of Massachusetts, USA). The teachers demonstrated wide-ranging knowledge of the engineering design process, and this paper describes two of the steps the teachers showed a more sophisticated understanding-constructing a prototype and redesigning. Examples from the teachers illustrate strengths that can be built upon as well as some areas for further development. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Design education; Design knowledge; Design process; Design research; Engineering education; Pedagogical content knowledge; Subject matter knowledge","Design Education; Design knowledge; Design process; Design research; Pedagogical content knowledge; Subject matters; Engineering education; Product design; Standards; Video recording; Teaching","Ball, D.L., The mathematical understandings that prospective teachers bring to teacher education (1990) The Elementary School Journal, 90 (4), pp. 449-466. , 10.1086/461626; Ball, D.L., Bridging practices: Intertwining content and pedagogy in teaching and learning to teach (2000) Journal of Teacher Education, 51 (3), pp. 241-247. , 10.1177/0022487100051003013; Ball, D.L., Bass, H., Toward a practice-based theory of mathematical knowledge for teaching (2003) Proceedings of the 2002 Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mathematics Education Study Group, pp. 3-14. , B.

The results show that there is a positive transfer effect of the systems approach applied to industrial automatisms on systems of another nature (hydrodynamic and electrical problems). However, this effect is less important for the pupils who study engineering sciences initiation for just 1 year (ISI) than for those who continue this education (SI) for a further year. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Systems thinking; Technical systems; Technological education; Transfer of learning","Electrical problems; Engineering science; Industrial systems; Physical science; Systemic approach; Systems approach; Systems thinking; Technical systems; Technology education; Transfer of learning; Economics; Engineering education; Technical presentations; Problem solving","Andreucci, C., La fabrication d'artefacts comme moyen didactique de conceptualisation de la réalité technique (2006) Aster, 41, pp. 153-184; Andreucci, C., The structuring role of artefacts in thought development (2008) The Cultural Transmission of Artefacts, Skills and Knowledge.

This need is important for nanotechnology to achieve its full potential. This paper describes and analyzes some contemporary philosophical interpretations of the concept of technological literacy. The paper then focuses on some of the metaphysical assumptions underpinning the techno-scientific literacy framework; and theories governing public understanding of science and technology, as the basis to propose a new technological literacy framework suitable in the era of nanotechnology. A case is made that the new technological literacy framework proposed is a suitable and essential pedagogic endeavour which should be seen as yielding a perspective through which meaning may be infused into the importance of nanotechnology development-a perspective as essential to the informed lay person as it is to the truly literate technologist. The paper concludes by analyzing the implications of the proposed epistemological framework on nanotechnology workforce development and makes recommendations based on this new framework to achieve a 'nanoliterate' society. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Curriculum; Epistemology; Nanoliteracy; Systems dynamics modeling; Triple Helix; Workforce","Epistemology; Nanoliteracy; Systems dynamics; Triple helixes; Workforce; Curricula; Nanoscience; Philosophical aspects; Engineering education","Batchelor, R., Bryan, L., Bodner, G., Daly, S., Delgado, C., Fornes, W., Introduction of emerging science into the classroom - The case of nanoscience and nanotechnology (2009) The NanoEd Resource Portal, , National Centre for Learning and Teaching of Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NCLT).

Teacher knowledge for technology education is generally assumed to play an important role in affecting pupils' learning in technology. There are an abundant number of teacher knowledge models that visualise different domains of teacher knowledge, but clear empirical evidence on how these domains interact is lacking. Insights into the interaction of teacher knowledge domains could be useful for teacher training. In this study, the hypothesised relations between different domains of teacher knowledge for technology education in primary schools were empirically investigated. Subject matter knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy were measured with tests and questionnaires. Results from a path analysis showed that subject matter knowledge is an important prerequisite for both pedagogical content knowledge and self-efficacy. Subsequently, teachers' self-efficacy was found to have a strong influence on teachers' attitude towards technology. Based on the findings in this study, it is recommended that teacher training should first of all focus on the development of teachers' subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. This knowledge will positively affect teachers' confidence in teaching and, in turn, their attitude towards the subject. More confidence in technology teaching and a more positive attitude are expected to increase the frequency of technology education, which consequently increases teaching experience and thereby stimulates the development of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge. This circle of positive reinforcement will eventually contribute to the quality of technology education in primary schools. © 2010 The Author(s).","Attitude towards technology; Pedagogical content knowledge; Self-efficacy; Subject matter knowledge; Teacher knowledge; Technology education","Pedagogical content knowledge; Self efficacy; Subject matters; Teacher knowledge; Technology education; Engineering education; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Teaching; Technology; Personnel training","Ajzen, I., Nature and operation of attitudes (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52 (2), pp. 27-58. , 10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.27; Appleton, K., Developing science pedagogical content knowledge through mentoring elementary teachers (2008) Journal of Science Teacher Education, 19 (6), pp. 523-545. , 10.1007/s10972-008-9109-4; Bleicher, R.E., Revisiting the STEBI B: Measuring self-efficacy in preservice elementary teachers (2004) School Science and Mathematics, 104 (8), pp. 1-10. , 10.1111/j.1949-8594.2004.tb18004.x; Enochs, L.G., Riggs, I.M., Further development of an elementary science teaching efficacy belief instrument: A preservice elementary scale (1990) Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the National Association Research in Science Teaching, , Atlanta, April 8-11, 1990; Garmire, E., Pearson, G., (2006) Tech Tally.

This paper reports the results of a case study whereby mechanical engineering students studying at a newly established branch campus in Dubai of a British university were exposed to vertical and horizontal integration. Different activities have been embedded to ensure that students integrated and worked together with their peers and colleagues at different levels. The implemented processes and practices led to improved academic achievements, which were better than those of a similar cohort of students where no effort had been made to integrate. The analysis revealed that cooperative learning and the degree of academic support provided by teachers are positively and directly correlated with academic as well as the students' own sense of personal achievement. The results are discussed in light of previous research and with reference to the cultural context of the study. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","engineering education; group work; students learning; vertical and horizontal integration","Academic achievements; Academic supports; British University; Cooperative learning; Cultural context; Enhanced learning; Group work; Horizontal integrations; Mechanical engineering students; Students learning; Education; Engineering education; Students","(2010) ABET: Assuring quality, stimulating innovation [online], , http://www.abet.org, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology Available from: [Accessed 5 December 2010]; Berg, K.E., Latin, R.W., (2003) Essentials of research methods in health, physical education, exercise science, and recreation, p. 108. , Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; Betz, S., The student-teacher relationship at the college level (1942) Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors, 28 (5), pp. 634-639; Feldman, M.L., (2006) Vertical integration of engineering education comprehensive report 2004-2006 [online], , http://www.eng.iastate.edu/vie/documents/final_report_60512.pdf, 12 May 2006.

The analysis emphasises the need for education in the social dimension of sustainability assessment in the context of the life cycle of a building and how such education of building agents could increase sustainability. Their approach includes a definition of sustainable education and describes both useful indicator and a descriptive-analytic method. Next, strategies and technologies required to implement and measure education are presented. From a holistic viewpoint, 'sustainable social building' factors must be evaluated, in part, using an educational indicator, to cover all aspects of sustainable building. It is contended that those responsible for building (local authorities, constructors and users) must be informed of and trained in sustainable issues. The proposed educational indicator could complement other commercially available methods (e.g. LEED) and incidentally improve the sustainability of other building parameters (e.g. energy). © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","architecture and building; engineering education; multidisciplinary education; social systems; sustainability","Building parameters; Local authorities; Multidisciplinary education; Social dimensions; Social systems; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable building; Engineering education; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Education","Aga, B., Cokl, U., (2011) Mapping potential: Identifying opportunity for innovation through interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, , http://www.plymouth.ac.uk, [online].

The aim of the course is not to teach design, albeit this is a side product, but rather to teach the fundamentals and the function of electrical machines through design. The teaching method is evaluated by a student questionnaire, designed to measure the quality and effectiveness of the teaching method. The results of the questionnaire conclusively show that this method labelled 'learning through design' is a very effective way of teaching a components-based course. This teaching method can easily be generalised and used in other courses. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","active learning; electrical engineering; engineering education; problem-based learning; teamwork","Active Learning; Electrical machine; Enhanced learning; Learning through design; Problem based learning; Side products; Teaching methods; teamwork; Curricula; Electric machinery; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Product design; Surveys; Teaching","Brandenburg, D.C., Ellinger, A.D., The future: just-in-time learning expectations and potential implications for human resource development (2003) Advances in Developing Human Resources, 5, pp. 308-320; Costa, L.R.J., Honkala, M., Lehtovuori, A., Applying the problem-based learning approach to teach elementary circuit analysis (2007) IEEE Transaction on Education, 50, pp. 41-48; Dorado, R., Teaching turbochargers via computer aided design software (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26, pp. 59-67; Harrison, W., Do you learn just in time or just in case?

Only the methods that use or can be converted into some form of mathematical equations are analysed. Some of these methods focus primarily on the assessment of the quality of teamwork product (product assessment) while the others put greater emphasis on the assessment of teamwork performance (process assessment). The remaining methods try to strike a balance between product assessment and process assessment. To discuss the characteristics of these methods, graphical plots generated by the mathematical equations that collectively cover all possible team learning scenarios are discussed. Finally, a typical teamwork example is used to simplify the discussions. Although each of the methods discussed has its own merits for a particular application scenario, recent methods are relatively better in terms of a number of evaluation criteria. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","analytical methods; assessment; individual mark; team mark; teamwork","Analytical method; assessment; individual mark; team mark; teamwork; Engineering education; Education","Biggs, J., Tang, C., (2007) Teaching for quality learning at universities, , Berkshire: Open University Press; Conway, R., Peer assessment of an individual's contribution to a group project (1993) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 18 (1), pp. 45-56; Goldfinch, J., Further developments in peer assessment of group projects (1994) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 19 (1), pp. 29-35; Goldfinch, J., Raeside, R., Development of a peer assessment technique for obtaining individual marks on a group project (1990) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 15 (3), pp. 210-231; Hansen, R.S., Benefits and problems with student teams, suggestions for improving team project (2006) Journal of Education for Business, 82 (1), pp. 11-19; Johnston, L., Miles, L., Assessing contributions to group assignments (2004) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 29 (6), pp. 751-768; Kennedy, G.J., Peer-assessment in group projects, is it worth it? , 42, pp. 59-65; Kilic, G.B., Cakan, M., The analysis of the impact of individual weighting factor on individual scores (2006) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 31 (6), pp. 639-654; Lejk, M., Wyvll, M., Farrow, S., A survey of methods of deriving individual grades from group assessments (1996) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 21 (3), pp. 267-280; Lew, M.D.N., Alwis, W.A.M., Schmidt, H.G., Accuracy of students' self-assessment and their beliefs about its utility (2010) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 35 (2), pp. 135-156; Li, L.K.Y., Some refinements on peer assessment of group projects (2001) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 26 (1), pp. 5-18; Nepal, K.P., An approach to assign individual marks from a team mark: the case of Australian Grading system at Universities (2011) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, pp. 1-8. , iFirst Article; Powell, P.C., Assessment of team-based projects in project-led education (2004) European Journal of Engineering Education, 29 (2), pp. 221-230; Race, P., A briefing on self, peer & group assessment (2001), York: Learning and Teaching Support Network; Willey, K., Keith, W., Gardner, A., Improving self- and peer assessment processes with technology (2009) Campus-Wide Information Systems, 26 (5), pp. 379-399; Zhang, B., Johnston, L., Kilic, G.B., Assessing the reliability of self- and peer rating in student group work (2008) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 33 (3), pp. 329-340","Nepal, K.; School of Engineering, Waurn Ponds Campus, Australia; email: knepal@deakin.edu.au",03043797,,,"English","Eur.

The complexity of engineering practice has been thought of as the root of challenges for engineers. Moreover, creativity has been emphasised as one key capability that engineering students should master. This paper aims to illustrate deeply why engineering education needs to foster creative students to face the challenges of complex engineering work. So a literature review will be provided by focusing on the necessity of developing creativity in engineering education. As the literature demonstrates, this paper reveals the understanding of complexity in engineering practice and the roles of creativity in engineering practice. In addition, the barriers to creativity in current engineering education and some implications of pedagogic strategies will be discussed. So this paper contributes to rethinking the engineering profession in a social context and a link between creativity research and engineering education. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","complexity; creativity; engineering education; engineering practice","Complex engineering; complexity; creativity; Engineering practices; Engineering profession; Literature reviews; Social context; Engineering education; Professional aspects","Amabile, T.M., (1996) Creativity in context, , Boulder, CO: Westview Press; Baillie, C., Enhancing creativity in engineering students (2002) Engineering Science and Education Journal, pp. 185-192. , October; Baillie, C., Catalano, G., (2008) Engineering and society, working toward social justice, , San Rafael, CA: Morgan & Claypool Publishers; Baillie, C., Fitzgerald, G., Motivation and attribution in engineering students (2000) European Journal of Engineering Education, 25 (2), pp. 145-155; Barakat, N., Engineering ethics: a critical dimension of the profession (2010) International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy, 1 (2), pp. 24-28; Beder, B.S., Beyond technicalities: expanding engineering thinking (1999) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 125 (1), pp. 12-18; Blicblau, A.S., Steiner, J.M., Fostering creativity through engineering projects (1998) European Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (1), pp. 55-65; Buijis, J., Smulders, F., Meer, H., Towards a more realistic creative problem solving approach (2009) Creativity and Innovation Management, 18 (4), pp. 286-298; Calvano, C.N., John, P., System engineering in an age of complexity (2004) Systems Engineering, 7 (1), pp. 25-34; Charyton, C., Merrill, J.A., Assessing general creativity and creative engineering design in first year engineering students (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (2), pp. 145-156; Chen, C., Hsu, K., Creativity of engineering students as perceived by faculty: a case study (2006) International Journal of Engineering Education, 22 (2), pp. 264-272; Christensen, S.H., Delahousse, B., Meganck, M., (2009) Engineering in context, , Copenhagen, Denmark: Academica; Corsi, P., (2006) Innovation engineering: The power of intangible networks, , London: ISTE Ltd; Craft, A., (2005) Creativity in schools: Tensions and dilemmas, , New York: Routledge; Craft, A., Jeffrey, B., Leibling, M., (2001) Creativity in education, , New York: Continuum; Cropley, D., Cropley, A., Engineering creativity: a systems concept of functional creativity (2005) Creativity across domains: Faces of the muse, pp. 169-186. , In: Kaufman J.

In order for the Internet to constitute an attractive alternative to the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), it must provide high quality VOIP services. Given the importance of VOIP today, a new course was introduced as part of the undergraduate curriculum for the Information Technology students with specialization in Networking. The main focus of this course is on VOIP protocols and requirements. Laboratory experiments were designed so that students can obtain needed hands on experience to better realize the concepts being taught. This paper will provide details on the VOIP course material, structure with a focus on the designed hands on experiments the tools used, and assessment process. © 2012 IEEE.","course assessment; course design; laboratory experiments; laboratory infrastructure; VOIP","Assessment process; Course assessment; Course design; Course development; Course material; Hands-on experiences; High quality; Laboratory experiments; Public switched telephone network; Undergraduate curricula; Voice over IP; VOIP; VOIP service; Engineering education; Experiments; Information technology; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Laboratories; Students; Curricula","O'Malley, S., Enterprise IP telephony: Evaluating the options (2003) Internet Telephony, , March; Collins, D., (2003) Carrier Grade Voice over IP, , second edition Mcgraw-Hill Networking Professional; Keromytis, A.D., Voice-over-IP security: Research and practice IEEE Security & Privacy, 8 (2), p. 2010; Klanjsek, J., Stergar, J., Vadlja, S., An educational multimedia IP telephony platform (2011) Proceeding of IEEE IWSSIP; Yue, K.-B., Effective course-based learning outcome assessment for ABET accreditation of computing programs (2007) Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 22 (4), pp. 252-259. , Apr; Sanderson, D.B., Revising an assessment plan to conform to the new ABET-CAC guidelines (2009) SIGCSE '09: Proceedings of the 40th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education; www.ABET.org; http://www.IEEE802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html; http://www.zti-telecom.com/EN/LanTrafficV2.htm; http://www.touchstone-inc.com","Shuaib, K.; Faculty of Information Technology, P.O Box 17551, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

The teaching model suggested by the present paper advances a genuinely workable and interactive framework providing a commonly-shared environment for students and tutors. Within this highly interactive environment, students can explore examples of tutor-proposed algorithms run on a large number of images from different areas, while developing their own methods for image processing on their own initiative or by observing the tutor's requirements. Conversely, the tutor can assess students' work within the same environment.

A number of key issues and questions clearly need to be solved and answered before any attempt for implementing e-learning is taken. The purpose of this paper is hence to investigate how to implement e-learning in the higher education institutions (HEI) associated with the subject of electricity in Turkey, considering the student perspective. For this reason, a web-based survey has been conducted to measure the extent to which the representative students in the Turkish HEI are ready for e-learning and to investigate their perspectives on issues for implementing e-learning. Two techniques were used: an online questionnaire with close-and open-ended items and semi-structured online interviews. 704 responses were analysed. At the end of the questionnaire, respondents were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. 63 accepted the invitation, but only 33 of them actually attended the interview. Based on the findings derived from the interviews, we develop a model to illustrate what principles are needed for implementing e-learning in the respective institutions. Overall, our findings show that e-learning is perceived as a solution for resolving some issues and it brings some innovation in the respective institutions in Turkey; and that it should be integrated into campus-based education and training via the blended learning approach. © 2012 IEEE.","e-learning; electricity; higher education; readiness for e-learning","Blended learning; Education and training; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Online questionnaire; Semi structured interviews; Semi-structured; Turkishs; Web-based surveys; Education computing; Electricity; Engineering education; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; E-learning","Childs, S., Blenkinsopp, E., Hall, A., Walton, G., Effective elearning for health professionals and students-barriers and their solutions.

Using a course assignment on software architecture styles, students had study a problem, find basis for a tentative approach, and discuss it online with programmers. The expectation was that students would find motivation for their studies from both the contact with communities of programmers, and from having to study and reflect upon their problem well enough to be able to draw the interest of members of those communities. We present the strategy we used, the developments and outcomes, and ideas for further application of this approach. © 2012 IEEE.","collaboration; learning; PLE; programming; social networks; virtual worlds","collaboration; learning; PLE; Social Networks; Virtual worlds; Engineering education; Mathematical programming; Social networking (online); Software engineering; Virtual reality; Students","Computer science curriculum 2008: An interim revision of CS 2001 (2008) Computing Curriculum Series, , http://www.acm.org//education/curricula/ComputerScience2008.pdf, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) & IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS); Robins, A., Rountree, J., Rountree, N., Learning and teaching programming: A review and discussion (2003) Computer Science Education, 13 (2), pp. 137-172; Despacho n.° 14253/2011-Regulamento do curso de Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática (2011) Diário da República, 2.

Being extensible via the addition of simple text files, the presented package constitutes a concrete approach that was missing from the related approaches that follow the virtual laboratories paradigm. © 2012 IEEE.","free; open-source; Virtual laboratories; wireless communications","Antennas and propagation; Educational software; Field measurement; free; Network planning; Open-source; Path loss; Text file; Virtual laboratories; Wireless channel modeling; Wireless communications; Engineering education; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems","Roehrig Christof, Jochheim Andreas, Virtual lab for controlling real experiments via internet (1999) Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Aided Control System Design, pp. 279-284; Coble, A., Smallbone, A., Bhave, A., Watson, R., Braumann, A., Kraft, M., Delivering authentic experiences for engineering students and professionals through e-labs (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1085-1090. , IEEE; Jochheim Andreas, Roehrig Christof, Virtual lab for teleoperated control of real experiments (1999) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 1, pp. 819-824; Casini, M., Prattichizzo, D., Vicino, A., The automatic control telelab: A user-friendly interface for distance learning (2003) IEEE Transactions on Education, 2 (46), pp. 252-257; Sancristobal, E., Castro, M., Harward, J., Baley, P., Delong, K., Hardison, J., Integration view of web labs and learning management systems (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1409-1417. , IEEE; Restivo, M., Lopes Antonio, M., MacHado, L., Moraes, R.-M., Adding tactile information to remote & virtual labs (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1120-1124. , IEEE; Edwards, L., (2011) JHU Wireless Technology VLab, , http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/userstories.html?file=10695, John Hopkins University; (2009) CNX Digital Communications VLab, , http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece463/SP11/cnx.htm, University of Illinois; Dimakis, C., (2007) Virtual Laboratory in Wireless Communications, , http://vlab-thlep.ee.auth.gr; (2010) WiFi Virtual Laboratory, , http://grid.cs.standrews.ac.uk/wine_vl/wifi_vl.html, University of St. Andrews, Computer Science Dept; (2011) EDX Signal Pro+Network Design, , http://www.edx.com, EDX Wireless; (2011) OPNET Modeler Wireless Suite, , http://www.opnet.com/solutions/network_rd/modeler.html, OPNET Technologies-Inc; (2005) ELANIX System View, , http://www.home.agilent.com, Elanix, Inc./Agilent Technologies; (2011) Analog/Digital Communications Training System, , http://www.labvolt.com/products/telecommunications, Lab-Volt Systems Inc; MATLAB Version (R2010a), , http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/, MathWorks-Inc; Liaskos, C., Koutitas, G., (2010) Virtual Laboratories on Wireless Communications, , http://vlabs.ihu.edu.gr, International Hellenic University; Molisch, A.F., (2010) Wireless Communications, , 2nd Edition.

Instead of using the traditional method based on doing practical exercises, a teamwork methodology was followed that consisted on a chip design project implemented by a group of students, each one playing a different role in the design team and being in charge of different tasks. A short training period at the beginning of the course was used for a preliminary assessment of students in order to assign their task and role in the design project. One of the students was selected as the project manager, while teachers acted as project reviewers. A set of control mechanisms, including internet-based video conferences and chats, was established. These tools allowed students to coordinate their activities and also were used by professors to check the work in progress during the course-apart from those review sessions taking place on-site in classroom. As a result of all these initiatives, students become more encouraged to do the practical exercises required to fulfill the course objectives and-at the same time-they developed and improved other complementary competencies, like the ability to work in a team and to defend their work by means of oral presentations. © 2012 IEEE.","learning with case studies; teamwork-based education","Analog integrated circuit; Chip design; Control mechanism; Course objectives; Design projects; Design team; Internet based; Laboratory course; learning with case studies; Oral presentations; Preliminary assessment; Project managers; Review sessions; Video conference; Work in progress; Analog circuits; CMOS integrated circuits; Curricula; Engineering education; Linear integrated circuits; Managers; Teaching; Technical presentations; Students","López-Martín, A., Attracting prospective engineering students in the emerging european space for higher education (2010) IEEE Trans. on Education, 53, pp. 46-52. , February; Dehaene, W., Circuits and systems engineering education through interdisciplinary team-based design projects (2011) Proc. of IEEE Int.

The effectiveness of the educational process is given by such factors as learner's intelligence, prior knowledge, level of motivation, stress, self-confidence, and learner's cognitive and learning style. The process of instruction supported by ICT is considered suitable and beneficial for learners of all styles. The reason is it offers a wide range of activities which can be used by any learning style learner and any teaching style instructor. The possibility of individualization of the educational process from both students' and teachers' point of view is the greatest advantage. © 2012 IEEE.","eLearning; ICT; LCI; Learning Combination Inventory; learning pattern; learning style; LMS; teaching style; university education","ICT; LCI; Learning combination inventories; Learning patterns; Learning Style; LMS; Teaching styles; University education; E-learning; Engineering education; Learning systems","Felder, R.M., Silverman, L.K., Learning/Teaching styles in engineering education (1998) Journal of Engineering Education, 78 (8), pp. 674-681; Gregorc, A.F., Learning/teaching styles : Potent forces behind them (1979) Educational Leadership, 36, pp. 234-238; Honey, P., Learning Styles-The Key to Personalised E-learning, , http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf, Access date 31 January 2011; Honey, P., Mumford, A., (2002) Using Your Learning Styles, , Maidenhead : Peter Honey Publications; Coffield, F., Learning Styles and Pedagogy in post-16 Learning.

They alternate with four weeks of regular lectures, classroom exercises, and hands-on laboratory exercises in a 4-1-4-1-4-1-structure. The structure is used for self-learning exercises in the first study year to overcome problems with academic performance and promote self-learning as a personal qualification. From the second year on, projects are carried out in the three reserved weeks. This allows time for working on challenging problems.

The method-which can be applied to both undergraduate and master courses-allows students to better understand complex circuit-and device-level phenomena, by describing them at a higher abstraction level. As a demonstration vehicle of the presented methodology, two examples are considered in this work: an analog front-end of a direct-conversion digital radio receiver and a modulator. In both cases, behavioral models of the different subcircuits have been implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and used by the students enrolled in two different courses: an undergraduate course and a master course. The results presented in this paper reveal that students become highly motivated and satisfied with the course contents and the proposed simulation-based learning methodology. © 2012 IEEE.","behavioral modeling; simulation-based education","Abstraction level; Analog front-end; Behavioral model; Behavioral modeling; Behavioral modeling and simulation; Behavioral simulation; Communication circuits; Course contents; Direct conversion; Electrical engineering course; Master course; MATLAB /simulink; Simulation-based learning; Sub-circuits; Teaching-learning process; Undergraduate Courses; Communication systems; Computer simulation; Digital radio; Education computing; Engineering education; Networks (circuits); Technical presentations; Students","Stefan, A., Behavioral models for microwave circuit optimization (2011) Proc. of IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 806-808; Abramovitz, A., Teaching behavioral modeling and simulation techniques for power electronics courses (2011) IEEE Trans. on Education, 54, pp. 523-530. , November; Pishva, D., A survey on howblackboard is assisting educational institutions around the world and the future trends (2010) Proc. of IEEE Int.

The project started in January 2011. The project formed part of wider research into how successfully SE (Systems Engineering) can be taught at undergraduate levels. The project reported here considered the ability of undergraduate SE students to identify and record SE competencies, building on recent work completed by INCOSE. It investigated how SE competencies may be enhanced or developed throughout an undergraduate course and industrial placement, and further whether undergraduate students recognize and record such development. This paper presents the findings of the project and proposes a simple mechanism to identify and map SE competencies throughout an undergraduate course. © 2012 IEEE.","competencies; professional development; STEM; systems engineering","competencies; Higher education; Professional development; STEM; Undergraduate Courses; Undergraduate students; Curricula; Engineering education; Systems engineering; Students","(2007) Creating Systems That Work: Principles of Engineering Systems for the 21st Century, , RAEng London, The Royal Academy of Engineering; (2008) UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence: The Accreditation of Higher Education Programmes, , Engineering Council UK London, Engineering Council UK; Evans, D.L., Beakley, G.C., Crouch, P.E., Yamaguchi, G.T., Attributes of engineering graduates and their impact on curriculum design (1993) Journal of Engineering Education, 82 (4), pp. 203-211; Keenan, T., Graduate engineers' perceptions of their engineering courses and their conventional counterparts (1993) Higher Education, 82 (4), pp. 255-265; Lang, J.D., Cruise, S., McVey, F.D., McMasters, J., Industry expectations of new engineers: A survey to assist curriculum designers (1999) Journal of Engineering Education, 88 (1), pp. 43-51; Meier, R.L., Williams, M.R., Humphreys, M.A., Refocusing our efforts: Assessing non-technical competency gaps (2000) Journal of Engineering Education, 89 (3), pp. 377-385; Martin, R., Maytham, B., Case, J., Fraser, D., Engineering graduates' perceptions of how well they were prepared for work in industry (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 30 (2), pp. 167-180. , DOI 10.1080/03043790500087571; (2010) SE Competencies Framework 2010-0205, (3). , http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/competenciesframework.aspx, INCOSE INCOSE UK Ltd [accessed 20 July 2011]; Bull, S., Gardner, P., Raising learner awareness of progress towards UK-SPEC learning outcomes (2010) Engineering Education: Journal of the Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre, 5 (1), pp. 11-22; Hubbard, E., (2011) Developing Systems Engineering Competencies in Undergraduate Students for Industrial Placements, , (unpublished); Barthorpe, S., Hall, A., A collaborative approach to placement preparation and career planning for university students: A case study (2000) Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 52 (2), pp. 165-175; Adriguzel, O.C., An evaluation of industrial placement in engineering programmes: A case study in Turkey (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (1), pp. 33-43; Willis, L., Horner, J., Engagement of academic staff with UKSPEC (2010) The Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre Case Study Report, , http://www.engsc.ac.uk/downloads/teaching-awards/case-studies-2010/ 230610-Horner-TA2010_web.pdf, [accessed 10 August 2011]","Hubbard, E.-M.; School of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, United Kingdom; email: E.Hubbard@lboro.ac.uk",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

These technologies (or tools) can be employed in distance education scenarios, or can also enhance traditional learning-teaching (blended or hybrid learning scenario). It is known and a wide advocated issue that laboratory practice is essential to technical education, foremost in engineering. In order to develop a feasible implementation to this research area, a prototype was developed, called 3DAutoSysLab, in which a metaverse is used as social collaborative interface, experiments (real or simulated) are linked to virtual objects, learning objects are displayed as interactive medias, and guiding/feedback are supported via an autonomous tutoring system based on user's interaction data mining. This prototype is under test, but preliminary applied results indicate great acceptance and increase of motivation of students. © 2012 IEEE.","Blended Learning; CSCL; Immersive Virtual Environments; Mixed Reality;

To make this revolutionary learning environment possible, we must allow the different users to carry out an experiment simultaneously. In recent times, multi-user environments are successfully applied in many applications such as air traffic control systems, team-oriented military systems, chat-text tools, multi-player games etc. In this investigation, collaborative working environments from theoretical and practical perspectives are considered in order to build an effective collaborative real lab, which allows two students or more to conduct remote experiments at the same time as a team.

The approach is based upon a general perception and definition of a system which can be applied to any level of system decomposition, throughout subsystems, components, units etc. Five principle levels-of-interest are introduced and appropriate UML models are suggested at each level, preserving model consistency within and between levels. Each modeled entity along the process possesses a functional, a structural and a behavioral model. The use of models is demonstrated not only at the analysis and design stages of development but also at the integration and testing stages. The entire agenda of the SWISE course is presented, detailing the instructional tools and case-studies used during the course. © 2012 IEEE.","Life-Cycle; Model-Based Development; Software Engineering; Systems Engineering; Unified Modeling Language (UML)","Academic course; Analysis and design; Behavioral model; Case-studies; Instructional tool; Model based development; Model based software engineering; Model consistency; Software modeling; System decomposition; UML Model; Engineering education; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Unified Modeling Language","(2008) Systems and Software Engineering-System Life Cycle Processes, , ISO/IEC 15288; Unified Modeling LanguageTM (UML®), , http://www.omg.org/spec/uml, OMG; Rumbaugh, J., Jacobson, I., Booch, G., (2004) The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual, , Second Edition Addison-Wesley; Gamma, E., (1994) Design Patterns, , Addison-Wesley; (1994) Software Development and Documentation, , MIL-STD-498 USA Department of Defense; Cockburn, A., (2001) Writing Effective Use Cases, , Addison-Wesley; Schach, S.R., (2002) Object-Oriented and Classical Software Engineering, , Fifth Edition McGraw Hill; System Modeling Language (SysMLTM), , http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML, OMG; Friedenthal, S., Moore, A., Steiner, R., A practical guide to SysML (2009) Morgan-Kaufman","Tomer, A.; Software Engineering Department, , Tzemach, Israel; email: tomera@kinneret.ac.il",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Moreover, standards can facilitate that games exchange data with other software agents (e.g. Learning Management Systems-LMS) in a standardized manner, which opens up a wide range of possibilities for next generation Game-Based Learning experiences. However, the application of standards to games poses a technical challenge. There is a clear need for tools that simplify this process for teachers and educators with limited technical background. In this paper we present how the #60;e-Adventure platform is addressing this problem, with special focus in the exchange of data to/from the games. Tools being developed for facilitating packaging, deployment and debugging of educational games with standards are described. On the one hand, these tools facilitate testing and debugging since they allow simulation of game deployment with active communication without needing a back-end LMS. On the other hand, they smooth the learning curve that is needed to understand the standards and their possibilities when combined with games. Finally a case study focusing on the SCORM standard is presented. © 2012 IEEE.","e-Adventure; educational games; SCORM; standards","Active communications; e-Adventure; Educational game; Game-based Learning; Learning curves; SCORM; Technical background; Technical challenges; Testing and debugging; E-learning; Engineering education; Information management; Learning systems; Reusability; Software agents; Standards","Padilla Zea, N., González Sánchez, J.L., Gutiérrez, F.L., Cabrera, M.J., Paderewski, P., Design of educational multiplayer videogames: A vision from collaborative learning (2009) Advances in Engineering Software, 40 (12), pp. 1251-1260. , Dec; Blunt, R., Does game-based learning work? results from three recent studies (2007) NTSA; Kebritchi, M., Hirumi, A., Bai, H., The effects of modern mathematics computer games on mathematics achievement and class motivation (2010) Computers & Education, 55 (2), pp. 427-443. , Sep; Annetta, L.A., Minogue, J., Holmes, S.Y., Cheng, M., Investigating the impact of video games on high school students' engagement and learning about genetics (2009) Computers & Education, 53, pp. 74-85; Smith, B., McDowell, P., Integrating the delta 3d engine with a scorm-managed learning environment (2006) Learning Technology, 8 (1), pp. 11-12; Torrente, J., Moreno-Ger, P., Martínez-Ortiz, I., Fernández- Manjón, B., Integration and deployment of educational games in e-learning environments: The learning object model meets educational gaming (2009) Educational Technology & Society, 12 (4), pp. 359-371; Wexler, S., Corti, K., Derryberry, A., Quinn, C., Van Barneveld, A., (2008) The ELearning Guild: 360 Report on Immersive Learning Simulations; Shute, V.J., Spector, J.M., (2008) SCORM 2.0 White Paper: Stealth Assessment in Virtual Worlds; Jiménez, A.D.A., Rodríguez, J.R., Alfaro, Z.M., Architecture for integration of simulations with scorm in e-learning environments (2008) 2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 217-221; (2007) IMS Content Packaging Specification Version 1.2, , IMS Global Consortium Public Draft v2.0; (2006) Advanced Distributed Learning Sharable Content Object Reference Model (ADL-SCORM), 2006 (20). , ADL; Malone, T.W., Toward a theory of intrinsically motivating instruction (1981) Cognitive Science, 5 (4), pp. 333-369. , Dec; Greenlaw, P.S., Wyman, F.P., The teaching effectiveness of games in collegiate business courses (1973) Simulation & Games, 4 (3), pp. 259-294; Hays, R.T., The effectiveness of instructional games: A literature review and discussion (2005) Naval Air Warfare Center; Pivec, P., Game-based learning or game-based teaching?

Even though positive correlation factors exist, e.g. between the number of Moodle accesses versus the final exam grade obtained by each student, the explanation behind it may not be straightforward. Mapping this particular factor to course numbers reveals that the quality of the resources might be preponderant and not only their quantity. This paper also addresses teachers who used this platform as a complement to their courses (b-learning) and identifies some particular issues they should be aware in order to potentiate students' engagement and learning. © 2012 IEEE.","case studies; Moodle reports; Moodle resources; performance analysis","Comparative studies; Learning management system; Moodle reports; Moodle resources; Performance analysis; Positive correlations; Engineering education; Students","Gomez, M.V., Contribuições para uma pedagogia da educação online (2003) Educação Online: Teorias, Práticas, Legislação, Formação Corporativa.

They are supported by pedagogical devices. We consider a pedagogical device as a set of means (methods, tools, procedures, and actors) intended to support a learning process. These devices include a pedagogical method (MAETIC, French acronym which stands for educational method instrumented by the Information and Communication Technologies), which supports, for learners, the acquisition of professional knowledge and know-how. This article presents the development of an Assistance Tool, which helps a teacher to design a pedagogical device dedicated to the training of professional know-how according to a project-based group active pedagogy. The device thus designed is instrumented using Web 2.0 tools. This work seems interesting to us because many teachers do not have the needed competences to set up a technological environment and few of them have the assistance of engineers to help them in this task. The interest of this assistance tool is then, to help teachers to formulate their needs (assistance in the design) and to relieve them from the sometimes tiresome and repetitive tasks related to the deployment of a teaching device (development assistance). © 2012 IEEE.","Assistance in Design; Authoring Tool for Teacher; Design Method; Pedagogical Engineering","Authoring tool; Collective learning; Design method; Development assistance; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning process; Pedagogical method; Professional knowledge; Professional training; Project-based; Repetitive task; Technological environment; Web 2.0; Design; Engineering education; Engineering research; Information technology; Learning systems; Technology transfer; Personnel training","Gibson, I.S., Group project work in engineering design learning goals and their assessment (2001) International Journal of Engineering Education, 17 (3), pp. 261-266; Thomas, J.W., A review of research on project-based learning For Autodesk Foundation, , http://www.bie.org/research/pbl/summary.php?id=27; Schneider, J.-G., Johnston, L., Joyce, P., Curriculum development in educating undergraduate software engineers - Are students being prepared for the profession?

In response we developed an engineering preparation course, a mathematics based diagnostic tool, Peer-Assisted learning support, engineering cultural activities, and redeveloped our core first year engineering course. Although in the early stages of delivery, these initiatives have been well received by the students. We are closely monitoring the results of these initiatives with the expectation that fewer students will abandon their studies and a greater portion of the marginal students will attain passing grades. © 2012 IEEE.","diagnostics; engineering foundation course; engineering retention","Academic achievements; Academic preparation; Diagnostic tools; Digital engineering; Engineering foundation; First-year engineering; Focus groups; Learning support; Secondary schools; Student expectations; Student surveys; Engineering education; Plasma diagnostics; Students; Technical presentations; Engineering","http://www.tec.govt.nz/Documents/Reports%20and%20other%20documents/ sac-educational-perfromance-indicators-march-2010.pdf, Tertiary Education Commission, New Zealand Government; Knight, R., (2004) Five Easy Lessons, , Addison Wesley; David, H., Malcolm, W., Gregg, S., Force concept inventory (1992) The Physics Teacher, 30, pp. 141-158. , March; David, H., Malcolm, W., A mechanics baseline test (1992) The Physics Teacher, 30, pp. 159-166. , March; Carnegie, D.A., Watterson, C., Andreae, P., Browne, W.N., Prediction of success in engineering study (2012) IEEE EDUCON, , (Forthcoming); Parkinson, T.J., Hughes, H., Gardner, D.H., Suddaby, G.T., Gilling, M., MacIntyre, B.R., Engaging learners effectively in science, technology and engineering: The pathway from secondary to university education (2011) Ako Aotearoa-The National Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence; Woodhead, C., (2009) A Desolation of Learning-is This the Education Our Children Deserve?, , Pencil-Sharp Publishing Ltd; Awad, E.M., (2004) Knowledge Management, Pearson Education India, p. 72; Shulruf, B., Hattie, J., Tumen, S., Individual and school factors affecting students' participation and success in higher education (2008) Higher Education, 56 (5), pp. 613-632; http://www.victoria.ac.nz/science/awhina/, The Rpwhina whnau","Carnegie, D.A.; School of Engineering and Computer Science, , Wellington, New Zealand; email: Dale.carnegie@vuw.ac.nz",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

During the years, standard formats to describe learning resources have been provided, reference content models to exchange them among repositories and between repositories and Learning Management Systems have been specified, large repositories have been deployed both from academia and from private organizations (as IEEE and ACM, for example). Researchers observe that open and widely available educational resources can significantly reduce the time required to prepare lectures; other authors argue that repositories facilitate education, combining different learning style theories with technology preferences. The focus is mainly on learning content. In this paper we give a different perspectives on repositories for education, having as a central point the educational experience. We report on a case study we are completing structuring a repository to collect credible evidence from Italian teachers who create innovation in schools using technology. We describe the technical issues we encountered developing an online repository of hundreds of experiences, carried out in classes of all levels of schooling, where technology was skillfully combined with pedagogical solutions to generate substantial educational benefits. © 2012 IEEE.","educational experience; Educational repository; experience metadata; experience taxonomy; multiple taxonomy","Central point; Content model; Educational benefits; Educational experiences; Educational repository; Educational resource; Learning contents; Learning management system; Learning resource; Learning Style; Online repositories; Private organizations; Standard format; Engineering education; Metadata; Research; Taxonomies; Innovation","Wenk, B., Open educational resources (OER) inspire teaching and learning (2010) Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 435-442. , IEEE 14-16 April; (2009) EDRENE-D2.6 State of the Art Report-II, , http://edrene.org/results/deliverables/EdReNe%20D%202.6%20SoA%20-%20II. pdf, January; Klicek, B., Zekic-Susac, M., Architecture of an experimental Web multimedia educational repository (2003) Video/Image Processing and Multimedia Communications 2003. 4th EURASIP Conference Focused on, 2, pp. 733-739. , 2-5 July; Nash, S., Learning object repositories, and learning theory: Preliminary best practices for online courses (2005) Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects, 1, pp. 217-228. , S.

Development of such generic or key competencies should be integrated throughout curricula along with specific competencies in the disciplines such as engineering. This is a common educational goal in higher education in the USA and in Europe inside the Bologna Process. To enhance the capability of students to articulate their lifelong learning competencies, we developed a Lifelong Learning Competencies for Engineers program. This was presented as a workshop in a senior design course at the University of San Diego. The workshop includes presentations on lifelong learning competencies and specific recommendations for engineers as well as an active learning exercise that helps students recognize their lifelong learning competence developed throughout their undergraduate career. After the workshop, the students improved their awareness of the importance of LLL for their future careers. Since lifelong learning spans disciplinary and national boundaries, this program could be adopted by other engineer educators and adapted by educators from a variety of fields. © 2012 IEEE.","Engineering Education; Key Competencies; Lifelong Learning; Professional Development","Active Learning; Bologna process; Educational goals; Higher education; Key Competencies; Knowledge economy; Life long learning; Professional development; Senior design; University of San Diego; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects; Students","Faure, E., Learning to be: The world of education today and tomorrow (1972) UNESCO, , Paris; Delors, J., Learning: The treasure from within (1996) UNESCO, , Paris; Knapper, C., Cropley, A.J., (1985) Lifelong Learning in Higher Education, , Kogan Page, Routledge, London; (2007) Lifelong Learning and Human Capital, , http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/50/38982210.pdf, OECD Policy Brief July Accessed 12 July 2011; (2004) Outcomes for Graduates Dublin Descriptors A Report from A Joint Quality Initiative Informal Group, , www.jointquality.org, European Union Accessed 12 July 2011; www.abet.org, ABET Inc.

It is a simple question to ask, but difficult to answer because learning is an individual process and there are normally too many factors involved. Therefore, benchmarking educational software is a complex task and a complete evaluation process requires a holistic approach where the evaluator, in order to understand how students learn, must determine how and whether the learning objectives were achieved with the educational software. When we talk about Game-Based Learning, we refer to a very specific type of educational software, games, with very definite properties and characteristics. Games develop personal characteristics that can contribute to becoming a good engineer.

The evaluation is challenging in most cases but especially when educational games are used. In educational games if in-game evaluation exist it is usually based on a series of simple goals and whether these goals are achieved (i.e. assessment). But we consider that evaluation can be improved by taking advantage of in-game interaction, such as the user behavior during the game and the type and number of interactions performed by the user while playing. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for educational games based on in-game interaction data. We discuss how user interaction data is collected in the most automatic and seamless way possible, how to analyze the data to extract relevant information, and how to present this information in a usable way to educators so they achieve the maximum benefit from the experience. The evaluation framework is implemented as part of the eAdventure educational platform, where it can be used both to improve upon traditional basic assessment methods (i.e. goals, scores & reports) and to provide information to help improve interaction with games (e.g. discovery strategies). © 2012 IEEE.","case study; Educational video games; framework proposal; Learning Analytics","Assessment methods; Educational game; Educational platforms; Educational videos; Evaluation framework; Evaluation process; framework proposal; Learning Analytics; User behaviors; User interaction; Behavioral research; Engineering education; Learning systems; Human computer interaction","Communiqué, L., (2007) Towards the European Higher Education Area: Responding to Challenges in A Globalised World, , Techreport; Elias, T., Learning Analytics : Definitions, processes and potential (2003) Learning 23, 6 (4), pp. 134-148; Paulsen, M.F., Experiences with learning management systems in 113 European institutions (2003) Educational Technology & Society; Brown, M., Learning analytics (2010) Learning Circuits Retrieved March, 2 (1), pp. 1-4; Williams, S., Williams, N., The business value of business intelligence (2003) Intelligence, 8 (301), pp. 30-39. , The Data Warehouse Institute; Hassler, M., Web analytics (2010) Redline Heidelberg, 3 (1), pp. 1-14. , doi:10.1080/19322900802660292; Dawson, S., Bakharia, A., Heathcote, E., SNAPP : Realising the affordances of real-time SNA within networked learning environments (2010) Learning, pp. 125-133; Jovanovic, J., Gasevic, D., Brooks, C., Devedzic, V., Hatala, M., LOCOAnalyst: A Tool for raising teachers' awareness in online learning environments (2007) The 2nd European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, pp. 112-126. , Crete, Greece; Gilleade, K., Dix, A., Using frustration in the design of adaptive videogames (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGCHI International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology ACE 04, 74, pp. 228-232; Shute, V., Spector, J.M., SCORM 2.0 white paper: Stealth assessment in virtual worlds (2008) Learning., pp. 1-10; Marchiori, E.J., Serrano, Á., Torrente, J., Martínez-Ortiz, I., Fernández-Manjón, B., Extensible Multi-platform Educational Game Framework (2011) The 10th International Conference on Web-based Learning, , In press; Marchiori, E.J., Torrente, J., Del Blanco, Á., Moreno-Ger, P., Sancho, P., Fernández-Manjón, B., A narrative metaphor to facilitate educational game authoring (2012) Computers & Education, 58, pp. 590-599. , (doi: 10.1016/j.compedu.2011.09.017). 2011; Del Blanco, Á., Torrente, J., Marchiori, E.J., Martínez-Ortiz, I., Moreno-Ger, P., Fernández-Manjón, B., Easing assessment of game-based learning with e-Adventure and LAMS (2010) Proceedings of the ACM International Workshop on Multimedia Technologies for Distance Learning (MTDL 2010), pp. 25-30. , In Conjunction with the ACM International Conference on Multimedia, October 2010, Firenze, Italy; Del Blanco, Á., Torrente, J., Martínez-Ortiz, I., Fernández-Manjón, B., Análisis del Uso del Estándar SCORM para la Integración de Juegos Educativos (2011) IEEE-RITA, 6 (3), pp. 118-127. , Ago; Dagger, D., O'Connor, A., Lawless, S., Walsh, E., Wade, V.P., Service-Oriented e-learning platforms: From monolithic systems to flexible services (2007) IEEE Internet Computing, 11 (3), pp. 28-35. , DOI 10.1109/MIC.2007.70","Serrano, A.; Department of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, , Madrid, Spain; email: aserrano@e-ucm.es",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

We show that contemporary society-as the result of social and technological processes-is markedly changing, so that social scientists speak about software modernity, the society of education, the information age, but also about the risk society. One of the problems in this society is the problem of fragmentation, which is among others manifested in the field of education and science. This paper tries to indicate what demands this situation puts on basic educational functions-ie. the functions of qualification, information, innovation, humanising, integration, and democratization-and how from this perspective the question of learning of social sciences of technicians should be considered in the current system of education. © 2012 IEEE.","contemporary society; educational functions; learning of social sciences; risks; technicians education","contemporary society; Educational function; Information age; Social scientists; Engineering education; Risks; Social sciences","Bauman, Z., (2002) Tekutá Modernita, pp. 182-183. , Praha: Mladá fronta; Toffler, A., (1992) Šok Z Budoucnosti, , Praha: Práce; Bell, D., (1973) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting, , New York: Basic Books; Drucker, P., (1969) The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines to Our Changing Society, , New York: Harper & Row; Stehr, N., (1994) Knowledge Societies, , London: Sage; Willke, H., (1997) Supervision des Staates, , Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp; Toffler, A., Tofflerová, H., (2001) Nová Civilizace.

This paper proposes an improved personalized e-course composition approach using shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA). The results of the simulations performed demonstrate that the proposed approach is a good solution to the problem raised.

However, there is no doubt that many personal data is currently improperly managed, especially by education centers and professors. This article presents GADM (Gestor de Alumnos para Dispositivos Mviles), an ad-hoc free software specially designed to help teachers to manage and monitor school information about the students' progress, their evaluation marks, etc. Moreover, GADM offers secure communications and appropriate management of such kind of data in educational environments. Our application has been tested by several teachers at the secondary education stage, with very satisfactory results. © 2012 IEEE.","Education; LOPD; Mobile Device; Personal Data","Educational environment; Free software; LOPD; Secure communications; Computer applications; Data privacy; Education; Mobile devices; Engineering education","(1978) Constitución Española de, , http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/enlaces/documentos/ConstitucionINGLES. pdf; Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos de Carácter Personal, , http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1999-23750, Ley Orgánica 15/1999 de 13 de Diciembre; Mileva, N., Stoyanova-Petrova, S., Tzanova, S., Mobile technology enhanced learning (performance-centered approach) (2011) IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 831-836. , 4-6 April; Ahmed, B., Alsaleh, K., Robotics: Its effectiveness as a tool to teach engineering design and computer programming (2011) IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1018-1021. , 4-6 April; Manso, A., Marques, C.G., Dias, P., Portugol IDE v3.x: A new environment to teach and learn computer programming (2010) IEEE Global Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 1007-1010. , 14-16 April; Romero, K.J.G., Lopez, D.A.R., Luengas, L.A., Guevara, J.C., Virtual flute: Electronic device that uses virtual reality to teach how to play a flute (2010) IEEE Global Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 211-216. , 14-16 April; Dueñas, J.C., Cuadrado, F., Experiments in evaluation: Towards an eXtreme Learning method (2010) IEEE Global Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 761-768. , 14-16 April; Paris-Requeiro, M.T., Cabrero-Canosa, M.J., Personalized constructionof self-evaluation tests (2010) IEEE Global Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 863-868. , 14-16 April; Besbes, R., Alimi, A.M., Benkhelifa, M.M., Gorce, P., Intelligent evaluation in educational context (2010) IEEE Global Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 401-405. , 14-16 April; (2010) On-Palm Solutions, , http://www.on-palm.com; (2012) Microsoft Access, , http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/; (2012) The Free and Open Productivity Suite, , http://www.openoffice.org/, OpenOffice.org; Tramullas, J., Garrido, P., (2006) Software Libre Para Servicios de Información Digital, , Madrid, Prentice Hall; (2005) Berkeley Source Distribution, , http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html; Naughton, P., (1997) The Java Handbook, , McGraw-Hill; (2012) MySQL Open Source Database, , http://www.mysql.com/; (2012) The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), , http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136101.html; (2012) The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), , http://www.gimp.org/; The secure hypertext transfer protocol (1999) Request for Comments: 2660, , http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2660, Network Working Group","Barrachina, J.; University of ZaragozaSpain; email: barrachina@unizar.es",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

The efficient retrieval of learning knowledge is a critical support mechanism for educational institutions to enhance the skills of their students and at the same time useful for learning process. Teachers and students face many difficulties when working with knowledge retrieval in education. Studies show that still it demands more effective approach. Semantic and Artificial Intelligence represent potential technologies for realizing e-Learning requirements. The convergence of e-Learning and digital libraries creates challenge to be solved not only at storage resources level but also at the knowledge retrieval level. Nowadays availability of infrastructure, flexibility of time, learning resources and their means of sharing has increased adaptability of Digital Library to learn and attain knowledge to a great extent. The objective of our study is to present an e-learning management system for Digital Library in Seville University that provides a general platform for learning environment. The idea is investigated from a search perspective possible intelligent infrastructures form constructing decentralized digital libraries where a global semantic schema exists. We suggest a conceptual architecture for a semantic and intelligent search engine. This project is a collaborative effort that proposes a new form of interaction between engineering students and E-learning platform, where the latter is adapted to individuals and their surroundings. We propose a comprehensive approach for discovering information objects in large digital collections based on analysis of recorded semantic metadata and the application of Artificial Intelligent technologies. © 2012 IEEE.","Case-based reasoning; Digital Library; E-learning systems; Intelligent Agents; Knowledge Management; Ontology; Retrieval","Artificial intelligent; Conceptual architecture; Digital collections; E-learning management systems; E-learning platforms; E-learning systems; Educational institutions; Information object; Intelligent e-learning; Intelligent search engine; Knowledge retrieval; Learning process; Learning resource; New forms; Platform for learning; Potential technologies; Retrieval; Semantic metadata; Seville; Storage resources; Support mechanism; Artificial intelligence; Digital libraries; E-learning; Engineering education; Intelligent agents; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Metadata; Ontology; Search engines; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Students","Jianfeng, Z., Study on E-learning education model based on web intelligence (2010) E-Education, E-Business, E-Management, and E-Learning, 2010.

This paper presents some statistics on the current situation and names some reasons for this fact. Furthermore, the fact that the majority of the students are male students is discussed, and some possibilities to increase the number of female students in these courses are presented. Arrangements which can be taken to increase the motivation of students and how potential students can be motivated to choose such a study program are also discussed in this paper. To get an idea of what is interesting to potential students and to students attending an embedded systems course, a questionnaire was developed.

In this work, a web platform that exploits semantic technologies to address such heterogeneity issues is presented. The platform allows migrants to annotate their knowledge, skills and competences in a shared format based on the European tools. The resulting knowledge base is then used to enable the automatic matchmaking of job seekers' abilities with companies' needs.

It is therefore important to be able to predict whether a student has a reasonable likelihood of succeeding in tertiary engineering study. New Zealand secondary schools mostly operate on the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) model whereby subjects are assessed on the basis of discrete individual modules. The paper compares the NCEA results to first year grades in tertiary engineering subjects obtained from most New Zealand providers of the BE degree to determine whether these NCEA grades can be used as a predictor of success or failure in tertiary engineering programmes. This is the first nation-wide survey of its kind and has yielded surprising results. For example, predicting success based on whether a student has not achieved is more insightful than basing on achievements, which is counter to the basis of many school league tables worldwide. © 2012 IEEE.","engineering preparation; managed entry; prediction of engineering success","Engineering programmes; First year; Government IS; managed entry; New zealand; Secondary schools; Tertiary education; Education computing; Engineering education; Forecasting; Engineering","Nash, R., A change of direction for NCEA: On re-marking, scaling and norm-referencing (2005) New Zealand Journal of Teachers' Work, 2 (2), pp. 100-106; Shulruf, B., Hattie, J., Tumen, S., New Zealand's standard-based assessment for secondary schools (NCEA): Implications for policy makers (2010) Asia Pacific Journal of Education, 30 (2), pp. 141-165; Loader, M., Dalgety, J., (2008) Students' Transition between School and Tertiary Education, Demographic and Statistical Analysis Unit, , www.educationcounts.govt.nz, Ministry of Education, Wellington; Everett, J.E., Robins, J., Tertiary Entrance Predictors of First-Year University Performance (1991) Australian Journal of Education, 35 (1), pp. 24-40; McClelland, A.A., Kruger, P.W., (1993) An Investigation of the Subsequent Performance in Tertiary Studies of Students Admitted through the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre in 1989-90, , Canberra Australian Government Publishing Service; Engler, R., (2010) Are Particular School Subjects Associated with Better Performance at University?, , Ministry of Education, Wellington; James, A., Montelle, C., Williams, P., From lessons to lectures: NCEA mathematics results and first-year mathematics performance (2008) International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology, 39 (8), pp. 1037-1050","Carnegie, D.A.; School of Engineering and Computer Science, , Wellington, New Zealand; email: Dale.Carnegie@vuw.ac.nz",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Non formal and informal education is the cornerstone for a lifelong learning and career development. But related knowledge and skills, derived from several years of professional experience, personal development, or continuous vocational training, are hardly recognized in the formal education arena. Candidates for a diploma or qualification have to confront more or less referenced educational syllabus. For a better classification and promotion of individual knowledge and skills, and a more effective definition of associated competency proficiency levels, this paper investigates two approaches, supported with tools, so as to guide candidates in self-assessment and as such facilitate knowledge and skills validation by examination boards. As preliminary results, applied in two higher engineering qualification contexts at Master degree level, they show that: (i) when candidates directly rely on a formal syllabus in a top-down approach, they tend to limit the scope of their potentialities; (ii) thanks to reflexivity using a bottom-up approach, when candidates define from scratch their own syllabus, impacts on self-confidence and self-efficacy are much more significant. In the latter case, individuals better underpin their lifelong learning and training, and thus enhance quality of personal employment management and actions plans. © 2012 IEEE.","autonomy; certification; continuing professional development; engineering education; qualifications; self-confidence","autonomy; certification; Continuing professional development; qualifications; self-confidence; Employment; Engineering education","(2005) What Is Lifelong Learning the View from the European Commission, , European Society of Association Education; Schön, D., (1983) The Reflexive Practitioner, , Basic Books; (2010) Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, , ABET.Inc Effective for Evaluations During the 2010-2011 Accreditation Cycle; Crawley, E., Malmqvist, J., Ostlund, S., Brodeur, D., Rethinking, D., (2007) Engineering Education: The CDIO Approach, p. 286. , http://www.cdio.org, Springer Verlag Details Accessed: November 2011; Rouvrais, S., Ormrod, J., Landrac, G., Mallet, J., Gilliot, J.-M., Thépaut, A., Tremenbert, P., A mixed project-based learning framework: Preparing and developing student competencies in a french grande ecole (2006) EJEE European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (1), pp. 83-93; Boud, D., Assessment 2020: Seven propositions for assessment reform in higher education (2010) Australian Learning and Teaching Council; Hussey, T., Smith, P., The uses of learning outcomes (2003) Teaching in Higher Educations Journal., 8 (3), pp. 357-368; Biggs, J., Enhancing teaching through constructive alignment (1996) Higher Education, 32, pp. 347-363; Rouvrais, S., Chiprianov, V., Modeling and architecting educational frameworks (2010) Electronic Proceedings of the 7th International CDIO Conference, pp. 20-23. , Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen June; Bloom, B.S., Englehart, M.D., Furst, E.J., Hill, W.H., Krathwohl, D.R., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook ICognitive Domain, , New York: McKay; Rouvrais, S., Chelin, N., Engineer professional identity: For an early clarification of student's perceptions (2010) Electronic Proceedings of the 6th International CDIO Conference, École Polytechnique, , Montréal, June 15-18; Zimmerman, B.J., Investigating Self-Regulation and Motivation: Historical Background, Methodological Developments, and Future Prospects (2008) American Educational Research Journal, 45 (1), pp. 166-183","Rouvrais, S.; Telecom Bretagne, , Brest, France; email: siegfried.rouvrais@telecom-bretagne.eu",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Such limited possibilities stipulate longer course durations and reduce knowledge creation quality. Possibility to gain some practical skills before carrying out laboratory assignments in real laboratory can become an essential part of the studies., facilitating much deeper understanding of the subject.

To this end, a number of software tools provided by nanoHUB.org have been incorporated as part of the practical lab exercises and linked to an e-learning virtual environment of a course on Electronic Materials, with emphasis on Nanoelectronic devices. The activities carried out during the course allowed students to enhance their understanding of those theoretical concepts dealing with Nanoelectronic materials and devices, thus becoming more motivated and satisfied. As an application and example, a set of experiences carried out by students is described. These experiences cover different Nanoelectronic materials and devices, going from physical and theoretical principles to device simulation. The proposed method has been applied to an undergraduate course, although it could be extended also to master students enrolled in courses dealing with materials science and engineering. © 2012 IEEE.","carbon nanotubes; Nanoelectronics; nanoHUB.org","Computational resources; Device simulations; Educational methodologies; Electronic materials; Materials engineering; Materials science and engineering; Nanoelectronic devices; nanoHUB.org; Online research; Teaching and learning; Undergraduate Courses; Carbon nanotubes; Engineering education; Nanoelectronics; Students; Virtual reality; E-learning","Pishva, D., A survey on how blackboard is assisting educational institutions around the world and the future trends (2010) Proc. of IEEE Int.

This survey was designed in order to refine our previously derived normative competence structure model for developers of embedded micro-and nanosystems towards an empirically refined competence structure model. Today the size of structural parts of nanosystems has scaled down to as few as a couple of molecules. This results in a lot of challenges regarding permanent and transient faults. Therefore bottom-up development techniques for nanostructured systems are now included into our competence model to prepare future developers to the specific challenges of designing at the nano scale. The evaluation of the content validity of the empirically refined competence structure model was accomplished by the presented expert rating. © 2012 IEEE.","competence development; embedded systems; fault tolerance; nanoelectronics; parallel processing; redundancy; systems engineering education","Competence development; Competence models; Development technique; Expert survey; Nano scale; Nanostructured systems; Parallel processing; Structural parts; Structure models; Transient faults; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Fault tolerance; Nanoelectronics; Redundancy; Surveys; Systems engineering; Nanosystems","(2008) Computer Science Curriculum 2008.

This implementation fits in the new European Space of Higher Education (ESHE) of the regulatory modifications promulgated by the Declaration of Bolognia. A new framework is proposed in order to optimize the continuous evaluation process for large groups. In this sense, ICTs allow continuous and interactive assessment with automatic and real-time results. A novel economically viable system is presented. It has been tested in the Telecommunication Engineering and Environmental Engineering Degrees at Rey Juan Carlos University.

Furthermore, attracting more young people, particularly young women, into Engineering Education, is a key-element in contemporary higher education. Universities will have to face these challenges, in living up to the requirements of change processes in a sustainable manner. Project-Mentoring as one example is an competence-oriented teaching and learning approach which focuses on integrative enhancement of students' specific and personal competencies, serves to increase young people's interest in Engineering and attracts new peer groups, connects theory and its translation into practical action and is sensitizing students for self-reflection and life-long-learning. Project-Mentoring is based on the theoretical framework of constructivist learning theories by supporting collaborative and active learning. It is founded on the mentoring relationship between students in their role as mentors and secondary school pupils (in their role as mentees). It combines a classic mentoring approach with action-oriented engineering projects and therefore can contribute to a widespread development of competencies of engineering students, of which this paper presents a detailed review in differentiation, and examines its efficacy. Project-Mentoring is aimed at secondary school pupils, in order to share the fascination of technology and to strengthen school-university networks. The objectives mentioned above are supported by the educational concept and by the structure of the module. The theory-based concept, its curricular implementation and research data of the complex efficacy analysis will be presented. © 2012 IEEE.","attracting and retaining practice; Collaborative and active learning; competencies development in Engineering education; mentoring","Active Learning; attracting and retaining practice; Change process; Constructivist learning theory; Engineering project; Engineering science; Higher education; mentoring; Mentoring relationship; Peer groups; Research data; Secondary schools; Self reflection; Teaching and learning; Teaching methods; Theoretical framework; Engineering; Group theory; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","(2010) Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development with Assistance of Irina Bokova, , Unesco UNESCO Publ., Paris; Istance, D., Dumont, H., Future directions for learning environments in the 21st century (2010) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), pp. 317-338. , F.

The data collected through face-to-face and telephone interviews with employers from Kelang Valley area of Malaysia in 2010 and from employers across sectors in various regions of Malaysia in 2006. The interviews were carried out only with high ranking officers, in this case; Head of Division or higher position to ensure accurate results. The employers responded to the level of satisfaction on each of the attributes performed by Malaysian graduates using Likert scale. The findings discovered that employers tend to rate engineering graduates better in 2010 than those in 2006. The result in 2010 indicates that there are 10 out of 13 attributes have a higher percentage of employers satisfied on the graduates' performance than to result in 2006. In 2010, the highest percentage (67.4%) of employers satisfied the performance of graduates on the ability to communicate effectively, not only with engineers but also with the community at large. However, in 2006, only 49.5% of employers satisfied the performance of graduates on this attribute. The attributes that obtained lower agreement on employers satisfaction in 2010 compared to those in 2006 are (1) ability to utilise a systems approach to design and evaluate operational performance, (2) ability to function effectively as an individual and in a group with the capacity to be a leader or manager as well as an effective team member and (3) having the knowledge of contemporary issues. © 2012 IEEE.","attributes; employers; engineering; graduates; satisfactory","attributes; employers; Engineering graduates; graduates; Level of satisfaction; Malaysia; Malaysians; Operational performance; Past and present; satisfactory; Systems approach; Team members; Engineering; Managers; Engineering education","Kamsah, M.Z., Developing generic skills in classroom environment engineering students' perspective (2004) Conference on Engineering Ducation (CEE 2004), , Kuala Lumpur; Shahrin, M., Nor Hasanan, Md., Wahid, O., Danial, M., Enhancing teaching and learning through the incorporation of generic skills for civil engineering undergraduates (2004) Conference on Engineering Education (CEE 2004), , Kuala Lumpur; Zaharim, A., A gap study between employers' perception and expectation of engineering graduates in malaysia (2008) 5th WSEAS/IASME International Conference on ENGINEERING EDUCATIon (EE'08), , Heraklion, Greece July 22-24; Yuzainee, M.Y., Omar, M.Z., Zaharim, A., Employability skills for an entry-level engineer as seen by malaysian employers (2011) IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference.-Learning Environments and Ecosystems in Engineering Education, EDUCON2011, , Princess Sumaya University for Technology.

The term intelligent transport systems is rather abstract and thus only vaguely associated with mobility by young people. Moreover, ITS is a young academic and professional field and cannot yet fully convey its significance as an attractive career choice to young people. Empirical evidence shows that attracting young talents to science and technology is a complex task and many practical approaches fail due to simplistic assumptions about factors affecting interest, motivation and career choice.

Precisely for hands-on exercises, the implementation of effective and cheating-proof assessment tests poses a great challenge. That is because of the static characteristics of exercise scenarios in the laboratories: adopting the environment for the provision of a unique hands-on experience for every student in a manual manner is connected with enormous maintenance efforts and thus not scalable to a large number of students. This work presents a software solution for the assessment of practical exercises in an online lab based on virtual machine technology. The basic idea is to formally parameterize the exercise scenarios and implement a toolkit for the dynamic reconfiguration of virtual machines in order to adopt the defined parameters for the training environment. The actual values of these parameters come to use again in the dynamic generation of multiple-choice or free-text answer tests for a web-based e-assessment environment. © 2012 IEEE.","Cyber Security Training; Online Assessment; Remote Laboratory; Self Assessment; Virtual Machine","Cyber security; On-line assessment; Remote laboratories; Self assessment; Virtual machines; Computer simulation; Dynamic models; Engineering education; Security of data; E-learning","Border, C., The development and deployment of a multi-user, remote access virtualization system for networking, security, and system administration classes (2007) SIGCSE 2007: 38th SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 576-580. , DOI 10.1145/1227310.1227501, SIGCSE 2007: 38th SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education; Bullers Jr., W.I., Burd, S., Seazzu, A.F., Virtual machines-an idea whose time has returned: Application to network, security, and database courses (2006) Proc. 37th SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, , Houston, Texas, USA; Gaspar, A., Langevin, S., Armitage, W.D., Virtualization technologies in the undergraduate IT curriculum (2007) IT Professional, 9 (4), pp. 10-17. , DOI 10.1109/MITP.2007.80; Hu, J., Schmitt, M., Willems, C., Meinel, C., A tutoring system for IT-Security (2003) Proceedings of the 3rd World Conference in Information Security Education, pp. 51-60. , Monterey, USA; Hu, J., Meinel, C., Tele-Lab IT-Security on CD: Portable, reliable and safe IT security training (2004) Computers & Security, 23, pp. 282-289; Hu, J., Cordel, D., Meinel, C., (2006) A Virtual Machine Architecture for Creating IT-Security Laboratories, , Technical report, Hasso-Plattner-Institut; Keller, J., Naues, R., A collaborative virtual computer security lab (2006) Proc. 2nd IEEE International Conference on E-Sciece and Grid Computing (E-Science '06), , IEEE Computer Society, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Lahoud, H.A., Xin, T., Information security labs in IDS/IPS for distance education (2006) Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIG-Information Technology Education Conference, SIGITE 2006, 2006, pp. 47-52. , DOI 10.1145/1168812.1168826, Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIG-Information Technology Education Conference, SIGITE 2006; Roschke, S., Willems, C., Meinel, C., A security laboratory for CTF scenarios and teaching IDS (2010) Proc. 2nd Intl.

Importance of Electronics hardware knowledge is based upon the fact that mostly parts of engineers in all branches are in your praxis often in contact with electronics hardware. Electronics hardware ranges from individual chips to signal processing systems and instruments in various applications areas as communication and control equipments. These should be consumer, medical, automotive, informatics, telecommunication and many others. To manage hardware in the right way means to save cost, to assure quality and to care and protect about environment and human health. To help and create fundamentals in this way is the main contribution for the introducing this subject as interdisciplinary. The reason to involve this topic in the electric engineering education system is endorsed also by increasing interest of students from various branches for this topic in last three years of its introducing in education process.

Undergraduate engineering students face packed curricula with little or no room for languages and an often unforgiving structure that puts them a year out of course sequences if they do travel for a study abroad. In this paper, we examine how online education can be a transformational factor in this challenge. When designed to create interactive, engaging learning, an online platform can support joint international experiences that develop cultural competency without requiring the time and expenses that are often a barrier for students.

The work centers the attention on the design and definition of a PjBL (Project Based Learning) initiative covering three different subjects. The main goal of this work is to develop social and collaborative skills not only between the partners of the same subject, but also between students from different generations and courses. The work proposes a multi-subject PBL (Problem Based Learning) activity where expert members from different subjects train to students groups. The initiative, which is carried out in the last courses of an undergraduate program, has been well received by students with having a direct impact on their motivation. In any case, but some aspects need to be planned with more deeply: coordination between students from different subjects and impact of the student groups that do not finish the activity. © 2012 IEEE.","educational innovation; multi-subject activity; project based learning initiative; student motivation","Collaborative activities; Direct impact; Educational innovations; Problem based learning; Project based learning; Student groups; Student motivation; Undergraduate program; Engineering education; Motivation; Students","Jenkins, T., Motivation = Value x expectancy (2001) Proceedings of the Conference on Integrating Technology into Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, p. 174; Alorda, B., Suenaga, K., Pons, P., Design and evaluation of a microprocessor course combining three cooperative methods: SDLA, PjBL and CnBL (2011) Computers & Education, 57, pp. 1876-1884. , Elsevier; Burguillo, J.C., Using game theory and competition-based learning to stimulate student motivation and performance (2010) Computers & Education, 55, pp. 566-575. , Elsevier; Bergan, S., Rauhvargers, A., (2006) Recognition in the Bologna Process: Policy Development and the Road to Good Practice, 4. , Council of Europe higher Education; Magdalena, R., Serrano, A., Matín-Guerrero, J.D., Rosado, A., Martinez, M.A., Teaching laboratory in analog electronics: Changes to address the bologna requirements (2008) IEEE Transactions on Education, 51 (4), pp. 456-460; Ebner, M., Holzinger, A., Successful implementation of user-centered game based learning in higher education: An example from civil engineering (2007) Computers and Education, 49 (3), pp. 873-890. , DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2005.11.026, PII S0360131505001910; Savander-Ranne, C., Lundén, O.-P., Kolari, S., An alternative teaching method for electrical engineering courses (2008) IEEE Transactions on Education, 51 (4), pp. 423-431; Mantri, A., Butt, S., Gupta, J.P., Chitkara, M., Design and evaluation of a PBL-based course in analog electronics (2008) IEEE Transaction on Education, 51, pp. 432-438; Valero, M., El aprendizaje basado en proyectos en los estudios de Ingeniería (2010) Cuadernos de Pedagogía, 403, pp. 51-55; Kjersdam, F., Enemark, S., (1994) The Aalborg Experiment.

On one hand, the Semantic Web provides data structures in order to break meanings barriers between distributed and heterogeneous data sources presents on the Web. On the other hand, the Social Web helps in clustering Web users into communities, and let them be prosumers of their Web experience. Both visions encompass many online applications, including Education. On the question of what is really the next stage of Web developments for Education, authors usually focus on a single of these two facets of the Web.

The biggest continual problems appear in mathematics. This is based on the high degree of abstraction and on the fact that the mathematical education for non-mathematicians, mainly engineering students, takes place at the beginning of the studies. Thus, deficiencies become apparent at an early stage. In order to facilitate freshmen's transition from high school to the university the Department of Mathematics offers a four-week introductory course to mathematics before the begin of each semester. The course is addressed particularly to freshmen of the engineering and natural sciences and mathematics. Additionally, a so-called mathematics computer course is offered for a part of the participants of the introductory mathematics course. In this two-week course the participants learn how to handle the Linux operating system, the employment of a computer algebra system (Maple) and obtain an introduction to the scientific text processing system LATEX. © 2012 IEEE.","computer algebra system; engineering mathematics; LATEX; mathematics bridge course; undergraduate students","Academic education; Computer algebra systems; Engineering mathematics; High school; Introductory course; LINUX- operating system; Mathematics course; Scientific texts; Undergraduate students; Engineering education; Latexes; Mathematical techniques; Text processing; Students","Scharlau, W., (1995) Schulwissen Mathematik: Ein Überblick, , Vieweg, Braunschweig; Schirotzek, W., Scholz, S., (2005) Starthilfe Mathematik, , 5th ed.

A study of international post-graduate programs is used to obtain insights with reference to student's relationships with colleagues, school staff and faculty, student's cognition about the program and learning process. The article shows how cultural and professional diversity can be addressed by leveraging a strategy based on interdisciplinarity, action learning and open learning environment. Findings are used to envision a model favoring the adoption of a glocal approach in the design of engineering programs. The model can be of value for practitioners and educators involved in the creation of multicultural learning initiatives to address the culture-specific needs of students while adhering, at the same time, to the global trends in engineering education. © 2012 IEEE.","action learning; cultural diversity; engineering education; glocalization; interdisciplinarity; multicultural education; student diversity","Action learning; Cultural diversity; Engineering program; Global trends; glocalization; Interdisciplinarity; Learning initiatives; Learning process; Open learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Students","Teichler, U., The changing debate on internationalisation of higher education (2004) Higher Education, 48 (1), pp. 5-26. , DOI 10.1023/B:HIGH.0000033771.69078.41; Vaira, M., Globalization and higher education organizational change: A framework for analysis (2004) Higher Education, 48 (4), pp. 483-510. , DOI 10.1023/B:HIGH.0000046711.31908.e5; Burbules, N.C., Torres, C.A., (2000) Globalization and Education: Critical Perspectives, , London: Routledge; Van Damme, D., Quality issues in the internationalisation of higher education (2001) Higher Education, 41 (4), pp. 415-441; Gho, J.W.P., Globalization's culture consequences of MBA education across Australia and Singapore: Sophistry or truth?

Globalization requires professionals being excellent in their fields and being able to work on a global scale at the same time. So far, engineering education has put too little stress on integrating intercultural competences into curricula. This paper shows new approaches to incorporate international experiences into higher engineering education. First, it analyzes the current situation of international student mobility in Germany, before emphasizing the general motivation for international student exchange especially in engineering science. A consortium of three excellent German engineering universities was put up to introduce new measures for increasing student mobility as is described subsequently. This paper represents work in progress. Thus, further results will be published continuously. © 2012 IEEE.","curricula development; engineering education; inbound; intercultural competences; International student mobility; outbound","Current situation; Curricula development; Engineering science; Engineering universities; Germany; Global scale; inbound; Intercultural competence; International experiences; outbound; Work in progress; Curricula; Engineering education; Students","Heublein, U., Internationale Mobilität im Studium 2009 (2009) Wiederholungsuntersuchung zu Studienbezogenen Aufenthalten Deutscher Studierender in Anderen Ländern, , Hannover:Hochschul-Informations-System (HIS); Wissenschaft weltoffen 2011 (2011) Daten und Fakten Zur Internationalität von Studium und Forschung in Deutschland, , Bielefeld:HIS, DAAD; Bach, U., Jungmann, T., Müller, K., Projektbeschreibung TeachINGLearnING.

As it has been argued in mathematics education research, not only the content, but also the form in which students learn is important for mathematics learning. Particularly, an inquiry approach permeates through the mathematics curriculum of several countries around the world. Additionally, the use of technology to learn mathematics has been increasing in the last decades, requiring teachers and professionals in education to constantly explore and learn new possibilities or affordances in the classroom. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a discussion about the possible and complex forms of interaction among students, teacher, mathematical tasks, and the electronic tablet (iPad) in an inquiry learning environment. An experience from a grade 10 classroom is used as a context to exemplify these interactions. © 2012 IEEE.","embodied cognition; enactivism; iPad; Mathematics K-12; problem solving; technology","Affordances; Complex forms; Embodied cognition; enactivism; Inquiry learning; iPad; Mathematics curricula; Mathematics education; Mathematics learning; Science and Technology; Undergraduate study; Curricula; Engineering education; Hand held computers; Mathematical techniques; Problem solving; Technology; Students","Gutiérrez, A., Boero, P., (2006) Handbook of Research on the Psychology of Mathematics Education: Past Present and Future, , Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers; The common curriculum framework for grades 10 to 12 mathematics (2008) WNCP, , WNCP; The common curriculum framework for grades K to 9 mathematics (2006) WNCP, , http://www.wncp.ca/english/subjectarea/mathematics/ccf.aspx, WNCP Retrieved February, 2012 from; The learning principle (2012) NCTM, , http://www.nctm.org/standards/content.aspx?id=2680, NCTM Retrieved February, 2012 from; Leikin, R., Zazkis, R., (2010) Learning Through Teaching Mathematics: Development of Teachers' Knowledge and Expertise in Practice, , Springer DOI 10.1007/978-90-481-3990-3; Anthony, A.B., Clark, M.L., Examining dilemmas of practice associated with the integration of technology into mathematics classrooms serving urban students (2011) Urban Education, 46 (6), pp. 1300-1331. , ERIC.

We propose that the use of ontologies can be very helpful when we seek to accomplish an overall domain interoperability and knowledge description. It is also fundamental for our proposal that a common vocabulary is used. For that, the core of the ontologies are described with the use of the OBAA metadata standard, an extension to IEEE LOM that provides interoperability among hardware platforms for the Brazilian context.

A network of eight Moroccan universities and the University of Brest has set up a mobility scheme for Moroccan Master students. The OTI programme Offshoring des Technologies de l'Information is governed by the strong principle of driving skilled young engineers to the benefit of Morocco economic development. Education in Morocco and France is specialized on the issue of software development. The mobility scheme should help to reduce the socio-cultural distance that is inherent to offshore software projects. Without neglecting the need of the good quality of academic education, the programme success relies also on complementary actions: students' selection in Morocco; welcome and support in France; search, placement and follow-up of internships in France with pre-employment in Morocco.

Such an independent work may be implemented e.g. in the context of lessons and visits in science labs for pupils [1]. Due to the steadily increasing content in school curricula-in Germany especially caused by the reduction of the high school duration by one year-many teachers do not find time to perform experiments with their pupils in the lessons. To extend and enhance the general education with independent experiments our science lab SinnTec has developed experiments that are closely aligned to the curriculum [2]. However, a single visit to a science lab alone does not provide the required holistic approach to education in natural sciences and engineering. We have therefor developed an integrated approach offering many different points of interaction between pupils and natural sciences/engineering topics covering exhibits and demonstrators, visits to our science lab as well as events and project work for pupils. A central aspect of the integrated approach is our versatile experimentation platform VenDASys, which allows teachers and especially the pupils to design, develop and perform their own experiments [3]. In this contribution we will outline the different aspects of the holistic approach especially using the VenDASys in combination e.g. with lessons, projects and our science lab for continuously enhancing the interest of young pupils in natural sciences and engineering. © 2012 IEEE.","cooperation; integrated approach; open experimentation platform; school curricula; science lab","cooperation; General education; Germany; High school; Holistic approach; Integrated approach; Intrinsic motivation; open experimentation platform; Project work; science lab; Engineering education; Experiments; Integrated control; Laboratories; Natural sciences; Stress intensity factors; Curricula","Euler, G.M., Quality development: Challenges to physics education (2003) Proc.

Mobile learning is raising growing expectations and is considered by some authors the next disruptive revolution in education. Cognitive and pedagogical theories supporting this prospect are reviewed. How these theories can be translated into meaningful educational practices is analysed by exploring ways of usage of mobile devices for supporting learning and teaching. Finally, a portfolio of experiments and case studies carried out by the Gradient group of the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid testing the application and effects of mobile learning are reported. These experiments show that the use of these devices is changing educational practices in a fundamental way. © 2012 IEEE.","e-learning; mobile learning; technology-enhanced learning","Experiments and case studies; M-Learning; Mobile Learning; Mobile teaching; Technology enhanced learning; E-learning; Engineering education; Mobile devices; Experiments","Gromik, N.A., Cell phone video recording feature as a language learning tool: A case study (2012) Computers & Education, 58 (1), pp. 223-230. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2011.06.013, [Accessed 21 September 2011]; Rojas, I.G., García, R.M.C., Carlos delgado kloos: Orchestration and feedback in lab sessions: Improvements in quick feedback provision (2011) LNCS, p. 6964. , Towards Ubiquitous Learning. 6th European Conference of Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2011 Palermo Italy, September 20-23, 2011 Proceedings; Heylighen, F., Clément vidal: Getting things done: The science behind stress free productivity (2008) Long Range Planning, 41, pp. 585-605; Immersive Education Initiative, , http://mediagrid.org/, [Accessed November 2011]; George, A., Miller: The magical number seven, plus or minus two (1956) Psychological Review, 63 (2), pp. 81-97; Moore, M.G., Kearsley, G., (1996) Distance Education: A Systems View, , Belmont, CA.

To improve performance the database system architecture and data structures, are designed accordingly. In this paper we design and develop a simulation tool based on the object oriented concept implementing class hierarchy and composite class hierarchy. A new simulation tool for object oriented databases entitled SOOD, is proposed in this paper, provides the flexible environment for defining, modifying and simulating the components of a OODB management system architecture. Thus providing a platform to plug-in different protocols and measures their performance under different conditions. It also enables users to customize and extend the framework to add more functionality or adapt simulation behavior as required. In particular, SOOD simulation tool represents a tool to highlight the strength and weakness and evaluate new architectural components in a relatively short time. © 2012 IEEE.","Database Management System (DBMS); Distributed System; GUI; Object Oriented Database (OODB); Software Architecture","Architectural components; Class hierarchies; Different protocols; Distributed systems; Flexible environments; Management systems; Object oriented database; Object-oriented concepts; Object-oriented database systems; Plug-ins; System architectures; Architecture; Data structures; Database systems; Engineering education; Graphical user interfaces; Management; Object oriented programming; Relational database systems; Software architecture; Tools","Elmasri, R., Navathe, S.B., (2010) Fundamentals of Database Systems, , 6th Edition"" Addison-Wesley; Paul, H.S., Gupta, A., Badrinath, R., Combining checkpoint and recovery protocols for distributed systems (2001) Proc. of 3rd Intl.

The main objective is to easily implement different control architectures in the developed platform and evaluate them under different conditions to better understand the main advantages and drawbacks of each control scheme. So, the student's tasks are focused on adjusting the control parameters of the predefined controllers and designing new ones to analyze the changes in the behavior of the whole system. A description of the subject, main topics and the platform constructed are detailed in the paper. Furthermore, the methodology followed in the practices and the bilateral control algorithms are presented.

What students learn as a consequence of these assessments is also called outcome based learning. However, designing questions in various subjects that directly assess the satisfaction of SOs is difficult for most instructors. If the questions are not properly designed such that they address the relevant SOs, student scores will not be a true reflection of their outcome based learning. CLOs (Course Learning Outcomes), on the other hand, are related directly to the course content and it is normal for an instructor to design questions that assess the satisfaction of CLOs. This is a traditional approach of designing questions where outcome based learning is not obvious. This paper compares the normally followed approach of designing SO based assessments with that of CLO based. Further, the paper presents a simple approach that allows an instructor to ask questions directly related to the CLOs and then convert the assessment data to obtain the satisfaction of SOs in each course. This way the results of outcome based learning are more authentic and are achieved with a lot less effort. © 2012 IEEE.","accreditation; assessments; course learning outcomes; student outcomes","ABET accreditation; assessments; Course contents; Direct assessment; Learning outcome; Simple approach; Accreditation; Data handling; Engineering education; Students; Systems engineering; Curricula","(2011) Assessment for Curricular Improvement, , http://www.engin.umich.edu/teaching/assess_and_improve/handbook/plans. html#creating, University of Michigan [Online] [Accessed 30 October 2011]; Blaha, K., Murphy, L., Targeting assessment: How to hit the bull's eye (2001) J.

To carry out our approach, we benefit from the techniques of image processing at end to make the conversion of raster images towards the format Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG), and to introduce semantic classification into SVG. © 2012 IEEE.","accessible visual pedagogical resource; image classification; image clustering; image mining; image semantic; SVG; vision with computer","Image clustering; Image mining; Image semantics; Pedagogical resources; SVG; Computer vision; E-learning; Engineering education; Image classification; Semantics","(2008) ISO/IEC 24751-1 Access for All Framework and Reference Model, , ISO/IEC; (2008) ISO/IEC 24751-2 Access for All Digital Resource Description, , ISO/IEC; (2008) ISO/IEC 24751-3 Access for All Personal Needs and Preferences for Digital Delivery, , ISO/IEC; (2003) IMS Learner Information Package Accessibility for LIP: ACCLIP, , http://imsglobal.org/accessibility, IMS Global Learning Consortium version 1 July; (2004) IMS AccessForAll Meta-data Specification, , http://imsglobal.org/accessibility, IMS Global Learning Consortium version 1, ACCMD July; (2002) IMS Guidelines for Developing Accessible Learning Applications, , http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/accv1p0/imsacc_guidev1p0.html, IMS Global Learning Consortium version 1.0 June; García-Robles, R., Del Río, F.D., Civit, A., Prieto, J.A., Promoting accesibility by using metadata in the framework of a semantic-web driven CMS (2005) Proceedings DC-2005 : International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications, pp. 71-77. , September; Smeulders, A.W.M., Worring, M., Santini, S., Gupta, A., Jain, R., Content-based image retrieval at the end of the early years (2000) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22 (12), pp. 1349-1380. , DOI 10.1109/34.895972; Almouzni, G., Traitement numérique des images (2010) Internet, , http://ga.perso.eisti.fr/download/TiPoly.pdf, [Nov. 2 2011]; Liu, N., Dellandrea, E., Tellez, B., Chen, L., Reconnaissance de la sémantique émotionnelle portée par les images basée sur la théorie de l'évidence (2010) Proceedings Conference sur la COmpression et REprésentation des Signaux Audiovisuels (CORESA), pp. 231-237; Scalable vector graphics (SVG) (2010) Internet, , http://www.w3c.org/Graphics/SVG, W3C [Nov. 13 2011]; Antonio, B., Tsoulous, L., Converting raster images to XML and SVG (2004) SVG Open 2004 Conference, , Tokyo, Japan, Sep. 7-10; Matseevskiy, A., Fourier transform in SVG graphics (2010) SVG Open 2010 Conference, , Paris, France; Battiato, S., Gallo, G., Messina, G., SVG rendering of real images using data dependent triangulation (2004) ACM/SCCG2004 Spring Conference on Computer Graphic, , Slovakia; Battiato, S., Barbera, G., Di Balsi, G., Gallo, G., Messina, G., Advanced SVG triangulation/polygonalization of digital images (2005) Proc. of SPIE EL-Internet Imaging VI, 5670 (1); Battiato, S., Messina, G., SVG rendering of digital images :an Overview (2005) POSTERS Proceedings WSCG'2005, , January 31-February 4; Dyn, N., Levin, D., Rippa, S., Data dependent triangulation for piecewise linear interpolation (1990) IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis, 10, pp. 137-154; Kermad, C.D., Chehdi, K., Automatic image segmentation system through iterative edge-region co-operation Image and Vision Computing, 20, pp. 541-555; Bellet, F., Salotti, M., Garbay, C., Une approche opportuniste et coopérative pour la vision de bas niveau (1995) Traitement du Signal, 12 (5), pp. 479-494; Pal, N.R., Pal, S.K., A review on image segmentation techniques (1993) Pattern Recognition, 26 (9), pp. 1277-1294; Bertolino, P., Montanvert, A., Coopération régions contours multirésolution en segmentation d'image (1996) Actes du 10e Congrès AFCET/Reconnaissance des Formes et Intelligence Artificielle, Rennes, , 16-18 Jan. 16-18; Sebari, I., He, D.-C., Les approches de segmentation d'image par coopération régions-contours (2007) Revue Télédétection, 7, pp. 499-506. , 1-2-3-4 Apr; Sebari, I., (2008) Développement d'Une Nouvelle Approche Basée Objets Pour l'Extraction Automatique de l'Information Géographique en Milieu Urbain À Partir des Images Satellitaires À Très Haute Résolution Spatilae., , PhD thesis,Sherbrouke University,Canada; Nagao, M., Matsuyama, T., (1980) A Structural Analysis of Complex Aerial Photographs, p. 199. , New York Plenum press; Boucher, A., Comment extraire la sémantique d'une image?

The research was divided into two parts. First, the pedagogical experiment ran following the pre-test-instruction-post-test structure providing comparison of students' knowledge defined by the level of test scores. The process of instruction either includes multimedia elements within the phase of explanation, or the explanations are mostly presented in the verbal form only. Second, the questionnaire monitoring the instruction was applied to show students' attitudes towards implementing the multimedia elements in the process. Despite the results did not prove significant differences in the test scores, students' positive attitudes towards the multimedia elements were discovered, which contributes substantially to the motivation to learning, as minimum. © 2012 IEEE.","engineering education; multimedia supported lectures; pedagogical experiment; questionnaire; technical subjects teaching","Multimedia elements; multimedia supported lectures; Positive attitude; questionnaire; Technical subjects; Engineering education; Experiments; Surveys; Students","Bílek, M., (2003) Visualization in Science and Technical Education, , (In Czech).

We used TUT Circle, a university-specific social-media service, as a tool for collecting and sharing alumni stories. For additional insights into alumni data, we created a set of visualisations, such as those showing educational paths leading to different professions. After reading the stories, we asked the students what they wanted from alumni stories and how social media (and face-to-face meetings) could be used to make interactions with alumni more useful. Students thought that alumni stories and visualisations were useful, but information that is more detailed and face-to-face meetings were also considered important. With more alumni stories, it would be possible to build alumni networks that would help students and educators to better link students' studies with future careers and increase their motivation to study. © 2012 IEEE.","Alumni story; commitment; motivation; social media; visualisation","Alumni story; commitment; Face-to-face meetings; Social media; Engineering education; Motivation; Visualization; Students","Krause, K.L., Social involvement and commuter students: The firstyear student voice (2007) J.

The idea is that the exam is a virtual race, competition or a match meaning that the students are graded according to the success achieved in the competition. The aim of the competition is set by the professor, and the students have to design a computer program to achieve the best possible result they can. In the paper the continuation of the proposed examining practice of CACSD education at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, is reviewed with emphasis on the robot soccer. The mathematical model of the two wheeled nonholonomic robot was given to students. Their task was to design the control algorithm for steering the robot and to implement a high level strategy to prescribe the reference path of the robot. This new approach also tries to break the traditional notion that students are allies against the professor and introduce a new notion with the professor and student being allies and with students competing against each other. © 2012 IEEE.","Computer aided engineering; Robot motion; Robot soccer; Systems engineering education","Computer aided control systems designs; Non-holonomic robot; Reference path; Robot motion; Robot soccer; Algorithms; Computer aided engineering; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Machine design; Mathematical models; Robots; Systems engineering; Students","Matko, D., Blazic, S., Belic, A., Virtual race as an examination test: Models, solutions, experiences (2001) IEEE Transactions on Education, 44 (4), pp. 342-346. , DOI 10.1109/13.965782, PII S0018935901098788; http://www.gemanigames.com/html/3d_xo_noughts_crosses_.html; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_sudoku; Kolmanovsky, I., McClamroch, N.H., Developments in nonholonomic control problems (1995) IEEE Control Systems, 15 (6), pp. 20-36; Laumond, J.P., Robot motion planning and control (1998) Lecture Notes in Control and Information Science, 229. , Springer-Verlag; Luca, A., Oriolo, G., Modelling and control of nonholonomic mechanical systems (1995) Kinematics and Dynamics of Multi-Body Systems, , J.

Educational engineering labs present an essential part in engineering education because they provide practical knowledge for students. Unfortunately, these labs equipped with costly instruments are available for little and limited periods of time for a huge number of students. An approach to circumvent the mentioned problems is by employing virtual and remote labs that assist the students in developing their practical skills, but applying this type of labs leads to the fact that students suffer from the weakness of the reality representation of experiment equipment. Our research is aimed at checking and proofing the appropriateness of augmented reality (AR) to be used in representing client user-interfaces in remote labs. Students can carry out an engineering experiment represented by real and virtual elements, components and equipment overlaid with virtual objects. © 2012 IEEE.","augmented reality; comparative evaluation; image processing; instrumentation; remote labs","Comparative evaluations; Educational engineering; Experiment equipment; instrumentation; Practical skill; Remote labs; Virtual elements; Virtual objects; Augmented reality; Engineering education; Image processing; Laboratories; Students; Experiments","Dormido, S., Vargas, H., Sánchez, J., Duro, N., Dormido, R., Dormido-Canto, S., Esquembre, F., Using web-based laboratories for control engineering education (2007) International Conference on Engineering Education, , Coimbra, Portugal September; Nedic, Z., MacHotka, J., Nafalski, A., Remote laboratories versus virtual and real laboratories (2003) Proc. 33rd ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, Boulder, , Colorado, USA, November; Nedic, Z., MacHotka, J., Nafalski, A., Remote laboratory netlab for effective interaction with real equipment over the internet (2008) Proc. 2008 IEEE Conference on Human Systems Interaction (HSI), pp. 846-851. , Krakow, Poland May; Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., The role of the laboratory in undergraduate engineering education (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 121-130; Ma, J.Y., Choi, J.S., The virtuality and reality of augmented reality (2007) Journal of Multimedia, 2 (1), pp. 32-37. , February; Sairio, M., (2001) Augmented Reality, , Helsinki University of Technology; Silva, R., Oliveira, J.C., Giraldi, G.A., (2003) Introduction to Augmented Reality, , Technical report, LNCC, Brazil; Milgram, P., Kishino, F., A taxonomy of mixed reality visual displays (1994) IEICE Transactions on Information Systems, E77-D (12); Zinser, K., Integrated multimedia and visualization techniques for process S&C (1993) Proc IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 367-372. , Le Touquet, France; Vidal, F.P., Bello, F., Brodlie, K.W., John, N.W., Gould, D., Phillips, R., Avis, N.J., Principles and applications of computer graphics in medicine (2006) Computer Graphics Forum, 25 (1), pp. 113-137; Juhnke, J., Mills, T., Hoppenrath, J., Designing for augmented cognition-problem solving for complex environments (2007) Foundations of Augmented Cognition, pp. 424-433. , Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Hughes, C.E., Stapleton, C.B., Hughes, D.E., Smith, E.M., Mixed reality in education, entertainment, and training (2005) IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 25 (6), pp. 24-30. , DOI 10.1109/MCG.2005.139; Navab, N., Developing killer apps for industrial augmented reality (2004) IEEE Computer Graphics & Applications, 24 (3), pp. 16-20; (2000) Facts, Figures and Forces behind E-Learning, pp. 4-81. , www.learnframe.com, LearnFrame New York; HEEPF Deliverables: E-learning and Simulation Labs, , http://www.heepf.org.eg; Aleksandrova, A., Nancheva, N., Electromagnetism-interaction of simulation and real lab experiment (2007) Information Technologies and Knowledge, 1; (2001) A Vision of E-Learning for America's Workforce, , www.nga.org/cda/files/elearningreport.pdf, ASTD/NGA Report on the Commission on Technology and Adult learning; Naidu, S., (2006) E-Learning: A Guidebook of Principles, Procedures and Practices, , 2nd edition, CEMCA; Huffaker, D., (2004) The E-Learning Design Challenge: Technology, Models and Design Principles, , Washington DC: American Society for Training & Development (ASTD); Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., The role of the laboratory in undergraduate engineering education (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 121-130; Das, S., Sharma, L., Gogoi, A., Remote communication engineering experiments through internet (2006) IJOE International Journal on Online Engineering; Ma, J., Nickerson, J., Hands-on, simulated, and remote laboratories: A comparative literature review (2006) ACM Computer Survey, 38 (3-7); Lelevé, A.A., Benmohamed, H., Prevot, P., Meyer, C., Remote laboratory towards an integrated training system (2003) Proceedings of the IEEE 4th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET03), , Marrakech, Morocco, July 7-9; Streitz, N.A., Cognitive compatibility as a central issue in humancomputer interaction: Theoretical framework and empirical findings (1987) Cognitive Engineering in the Design of Human-computer Interaction and Expert Systems, pp. 75-82. , G.

However, in spite of this high demand, few students plan to start engineering studies. Moreover, women tend to be underrepresented in engineering courses. What is the reason for this paradox, considering that one of the most widely demanded professional careers is one of the least pursued? In this paper we present tools that have been used to measure students' attitudes towards engineering and some of the results obtained in an attempt to understand students' motivations when choosing their degrees. We also put forward the gender issue, and offer some data about the participation of females in engineering studies. Finally, we propose some of the strategies and activities that can be used to encourage students to select a career in engineering. © 2012 IEEE.","attitudes to engineering; engineering enrollment; fostering engineering careers","Engineering careers; Engineering course; Engineering enrollments; Gender issues; Global economic crisis; High demand; Professional careers; Employment; Engineering education; Students; Technical presentations; Professional aspects",,"Oliver, J.; Engineering Faculty, , Bilbao, Spain; email: javier.oliver@deusto.es",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

It reports on the experience of using the technique of project-based learning as a motivating method for teaching computer vision strategies within the context of a Master's program module in Visual Perception at the University of Girona (Spain). Students were asked to generate projects which involved the use of invariant features, i.e. algorithms to detect and describe local features in images. Within this project-based context, students were encouraged to search for information resources that would accompany their project ideas. Every student team was supervised by a tutoring instructor and periodic meetings were scheduled during this six-week project to follow their progress. © 2012 IEEE.","computer vision; oral presentation; Project-Based Learning (PBL); teamwork","Effective teaching; Information resource; Invariant features; Local feature; Oral presentations; Program module; Project based learning; Project-based; Student teams; teamwork; Visual perception; Engineering education; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Computer vision","Harris, J.H., Katz, L.G., (2001) Young Investigators: The Project Approach in the Early Years, , Ed.

We adapted and applied the Social Network Analysis methodology to online discussion forums to create a dynamical interaction graph. The graph can be embedded in learning managements systems and accessed through a web page. The functionality of the system provides a suitable environment to characterize the interactions between actors and their participations in discussion forums. In the article we describe the use of the system in two real-world situations. Our conclusions lead to the verification and the rapid identification of some important situations that occur in learning communities, such as: the location of actors more or less active; distinction of positions and roles; identification of different ways of organization/interaction in groups; characterization of the interactions of a group or of a community as a whole © 2012 IEEE.","communication patterns; interaction graph; Learning Management Systems; online interactions; Social Network Analysis","Communication pattern; Interaction graphs; Learning management system; Online interaction; Social Network Analysis; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Social networking (online); Online systems","Scott, J., Social network analysis (1988) Sociology, 22, pp. 109-127. , February doi:10.1177/0038038588022001007; Krebs, V., (2011) Social Network Analysis, , http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html, Oct; (2010) Dracula Graph Library, , http://www.graphdracula.net, Dracula Graph Library [Oct 2011]; (2011) Scalar Vector Graphics, , http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG, SVG 1.1 2nd Edition [Nov 2011]; (2011) About Moodle, , http://docs.moodle.org/en/About_Moodle, Moodle [Oct 2011]; Luhn, H.P., The automatic creation of literature abstracts (1958) IBM Journal of Research and Development, 2, pp. 159-165","Silva, A.; Faculty of Sciences, , Porto, Portugal; email: ams@dcc.fc.up.pt",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Usually, the students' problems are not rooted in a lack of intellectual capacity or previously acquired founding expertise in the chosen course of study. Rather, it is the deficiencies in more basic competencies such as practical and cognitive, self and social areas that place a major hurdle in the students' learning process. In an attempt to elucidate and improve this situation, as a first step we develop a questionnaire that captures the lecturers' expectations on student competencies in these areas, as opposed to their view on competencies that first-year students possess in reality. This questionnaire is also applied to capture the university-employer skill gap. © 2012 IEEE.","competence tests; introductory skill and competence levels; pracitical and learning competencies; self competencies; skill gap; social competencies; soft skill competencies","competence tests; introductory skill and competence levels; pracitical and learning competencies; self competencies; skill gap; social competencies; Soft skills; Engineering education; Surveys; Teaching; Students","Böttcher, A., Thurner, V., Müller, G., Kompetenzorientierte lehre im software engineering (2011) SEUH 2011-Software Engineering im Unterricht der Hochschulen, pp. 33-39. , J.

In this paper a taxonomical analysis of papers published in two EER journals is used to create a characterization of the work published in these two publications from an IT perspective. The analyzed papers are from the first 2011 number of IEEE Transactions on Education, (21 papers) and from the two 2011 numbers of the ASEE-published Advances in Engineering Education (22 papers). Applying an existing framework, seven taxonomical dimensions are used to characterize the papers. In addition this data is compared with that from an earlier taxonomical analysis of computing education publications. We conclude that from an IT research point of view, both of these journals represent attractive publication channels and we note some indications of a developing maturity of engineering education research as a field of scholarship. © 2012 IEEE.","bibliometric analysis; engineering education research; Taxonomical classification; taxonomical dimensions","Bibliometric analysis; Computing education; Engineering education research; IT research; Research approach; taxonomical dimensions; Engineering education; Research; Publishing","Jesiek, B.K., Borrego, M., Beddoes, K., Hurtado, M., Rajendran, P., Sangam, D., Mapping global trends in engineering education research, 2005-2008 (2011) Int.

Most of the student projects are tailored in their complexity and need a defined time for a student team within one semester. With this defined and often reduced complexity of the projects the practical relevance is doubtful. In this here shown approach for a PBL lab an industry project with the original complexity is used and structured into several parts. These are sequentially dependent and have to be solved in a defined order by student groups. Each group has to develop one component and has the responsibility for a working result at the end of their subproject. Each group interacts with other groups during the same semester to develop a working system. Student groups in the following semesters take the results from previous semesters and develop the entire project further on. With this type of PBL an own dynamic of the student work is evolving which is not possible with small complexity tailored projects. © 2012 IEEE.","Educational technology; Electrical engineering education; Instrumentation and measurement; Measurment techniques","Educational technology; Industry project; Measurment; Project based learning; Reduced complexity; Student groups; Student project; Student teams; Working systems; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Teaching; Students",,"Fuhrmann, T.; Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, , Regensburg, Germany; email: thomas.fuhrmann@hs-regensburg.de",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

They have been successfully implemented in a wide range of subjects, but we still need to build training facilities for the uncovered/new branches of learning. In general, the structure of the laboratory varies depending on the subject area; however, in many cases, especially in the case of ICT subjects, it is possible to use the same configurations for more than one course-topic, Networking and Internet Security for example. This means that we only need to create a prototype then we can have as many labs as we wish by making copies of it. This is not possible with all laboratory-types, but certain technologies make it doable. In this paper, we describe how we used Virtualization Technology (normal and nested) to achieve this successfully. In our system the laboratory components are constructed using Virtual Machines, and then packaged to make one prototype from which we could create a number of labs for different ICT courses. © 2012 IEEE.","Duplication Nested Virtualization; K3.1.d Distance Learning; K3.2 Computer and Information Science Education; Web-based Laboratories","Computer and information science educations; Ease-of-use; Educational institutions; ICT course; Internet security; Laboratory components; Online laboratory; Training facility; Virtual machines; Virtualizations; Web based laboratories; Distance education; Engineering education; Information technology; Virtual reality; Websites; Laboratories","Anisetti, M., Bellandi, V., Colombo, A., Cremonini, M., Damiani, E., Frati, F., Hounson, J.T., Rebeccani, D., Learning computer networking on open paravirtual laboratories (2007) IEEE Trans.

This paper presents a method to improve engineering student persistence and learning in calculus without any changes in the current calculus curriculum. The proposed method combines the integration of real world engineering problems into existing Calculus II courses and engineering mentors to help students to solve calculus problems. The implementation of this method was achieved through a pilot study administered to undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a Calculus II course at a mid-size research institution in the Midwest. The results of the pilot show that engineering problems helped the student participants to learn calculus. Students benefited from working closely with their peers and their mentors in the Calculus II course, and they felt more connected to other students in math and/or engineering. © 2012 IEEE.","Calculus; Engineering Education; Engineering Modules; Retention","Calculus; Engineering modules; Engineering problems; Influential factors; Pilot studies; Research institutions; Retention; Undergraduate engineering students; Calculations; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Problem solving; Students","(2005) Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for A Brighter Economic Future, , National Academy of Science, Washington DC, National Academies Press; (2010) Rising above the Gathering Storm, Revisited: Rapidly Approaching Category 5, , National Academy of Science, Washington DC, National Academiy Press; (2008) Science and Engineering Degrees: 1966-2006 (Detailed Statistical Tables NSF 08-321), , National Science FoundationDivision of Science, Resources Statistics; (2007) Is America Falling off the Flat Earth?, , National Academy of Sciences, Washington DC, National Academies Press; Hensel, R., Sigler, J., Lowery, A., Breaking the cycle of calculus failure: Models of early math intervention to enhance engineering retention (2008) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Grattis, C., Hill, B., Lachowsky, A., A successful peer mentoring program (2007) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Johnson, M., Sheppard, S., Students entering and exiting the engineering pipeline-identifying key decision points and trends (2002) Proceedings of the Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. S3C13-S3C19; Knight, D., Carlson, L., Sullivan, J., Improving engineering student retention through hands-on, team based, first-year design projects (2007) Proceedings of the Conference on Research in Engineering Education, pp. 1-13; Hensel, R., Sigler, J., Lowery, A., Breaking the cycle of calculus failure: Models of early math intervention to enhance engineering retention (2008) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition, , June; Lowery, A., Kane, S., Kane, V., Hensel, R., Ganser, G., Joint math-engineering projects to facilitate calculus success in first year students (2010) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Laoulache, R., Pendergrass, N., Crawford, R., Kowalczyk, R., Integrating engineering courses with calculus and physics to motivate learning of fundamental concepts (2001) Proceedings of the Frontiers in Education Conference; Quintanilla, J., D'Souza, N., Lui, J., Mirshams, R., Integration of engineering concepts in freshman calculus (2007) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Hensel, R., Sigler, J., Lowery, A., Breaking the cycle of calculus failure: Models of early math intervention to enhance engineering retention (2008) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Koch, D., Herrin, G., Intervention strategy for improving success rates in calculus (2006) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition","Kaabouch, N.; Department of Electrical Engineering, , Grand Forks, ND, United States",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

The data collected revealed a number of reasons that make students like, or dislike, scientific majors. These reasons include the presence or absence of capable teachers and the choice of the teaching language. The results presented in the paper also focus on differences between public and private institutions, male and female students, as well as nationals and non-nationals.

We have been working towards a more dynamic e-learning platform following a decentralized approach based on iGoogle. Users are able to decide about the information and functionalities in the system through the management of gadgets (iGoogle widgets). In this way, iGoogle is transformed into a kind of Personal Learning Environment that can be controlled by final users. In this paper we introduce a set of gadgets to provide an appropriate learning support to different roles: student, author and teacher assistant. These gadgets can be combined with other existing iGoogle gadgets following the specifications of the iGoogle platform and the Open Social standard. © 2012 IEEE.","Educational activities; Electronic learning; Gadget; iGoogle; OpenSocial; PLE; Web services","Educational activities; Electronic learning; Gadget; iGoogle; OpenSocial; PLE; Engineering education; Equipment; Information management; Web services; E-learning","Hongyu, Z., Liyou, Y., Yongqiang, W., The personal learning environment (PLE) based on web2.0 (2010) Web Society (SWS) 2010 IEEE 2nd Symposium on, pp. 22-25. , 16-17 Aug. doi: 10.1109/SWS.2010.5607483; Kompen, R.T., Edirisingha, P., Monguet, J.M., Using web 2.0 applications as supporting tools for personal learning environments (2009) Best Practices for the Knowledge Society.

The publication guide was implemented at the Faculty of Engineering and many positive results achieved. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Academic paper; Conference papers; Design Principles; Key elements; Qualitative approach; Information theory; Engineering education","Houp, K.W., Pearsall, T.E., Tebeaux, E., (1998) Reporting Technical Information, , Oxford University Press London; Slack, S., (2002) Communication for Electrical Engineering, Oxford, , University Press: Clarendon; Klatt, B., (1999) The Ultimate Training Workshop Handbook, , McGraw Hill, 1st Edition Chapter 1; Hassel-Corbiell, (2001) Developing Training Courses: A Technical Writer's Guide to Instructional Design and Development, , 1st Edition, Learning Edge Publishing, Tacoma, Washington, Chapter 12; Jupp, V., (2011) The Sage Dictionary of Social Research Methods, , Sage Publications London; Thorpe, R., Holt, R., (2010) The Sage Dictionary of Qualitative Management Research, , Sage Publications Ltd; Saldana, J., (2009) The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers, , Sage Publications Ltd","Clarke, W.A.; School of Electrical Engineering, South Africa; email: willemc@uj.ac.za",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

The main objective of this new level of learning is to allow learners to perform activities using contextual information and deliver them suitable content, services anywhere at anytime. As research focuses on using contextual information to achieve this goal, a topic as access control based on context in Learning Management Systems seems to be undercovered. Our paper present several cases where it might be necessary to restrict and control access to learning materials/features/activities based on contextual information such as location, time, etc. We associate these elements (context and access control) and decide whether to grant access or to adapt a resource in a learning activity. © 2012 IEEE.","accessibility; adaptativity; context; context aware access control; learning adaptability; mobile; security","accessibility; adaptativity; context; Context-aware access control; learning adaptability; mobile; security; Access control; Engineering education; Information management","Dey, A.K., Abowd, G., Towards a better understanding of context and context-awareness (2000) 2000 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2000), , The Hague, The Netherlands, April 3; (2005) Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, , International Student's Edition 7th Edition Oxford University; Kravcik, M., Burgos, D., Lebrun, M., Oneto, L., (2008) Integrated Model of Adaptive Learning Based on Standards, , GRAPPLE Deliverable 5.1 Version: 1.0; Virginia Information Technologies Agency Developing Accessible E-Learning, , http://vita.virginia.gov/uploadedfiles/VITA_Main_Public/unmanaged/ library/accessibility/DevelopingAccessibleELearning.pdf, v1.0; Yau, J., Joy, M.Y.-K., A mobile and context-aware adaptive learning schedule framework from a usability perspective-A 'diary: Diary-questionnaire' study (2009) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computers in Education [CDROM], , Hong Kong: Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education; Hwang, G.-J., Yang, T.-C., Tsai, C.-C., Stephen, J.H., YANG A context-aware ubiquitous learning environment for conducting complex science experiments (2009) Computers & Education, 53, pp. 402-413. , Elsevier; Economides, A., Context-aware mobile learning.

The proposed hybrid system design presents the foundation for future sustainable high efficiency illumination systems. In this system design, an FPGA is used to individually control an array of HB LEDs. Each HB LED can operate in a different mode defined by the user. Photovoltaic (PV) panels-based systems are used as the primary source of energy in this system while the electric grid is used as the backup source that supplies power to the HB LEDs only when the power of the PV system is not sufficient to supply all the system HB LEDs and the PV system batteries are depleted below the minimum level set in the system design. This new hybrid design should serve as an important link between the current AC-based illumination systems and future sustainable DC-based solar illumination systems. Since computer simulation is an important tool for future illumination system design and analysis, it is presented to assist designers in studying different designs and in optimizing the one to be implemented. © 2012 IEEE.","FPGA; High Brighness LED; Hybrid; Photovoltaic","Design and Development; Electric grids; High brightness; High brightness LEDs; Hybrid; Hybrid design; Illumination system; Illumination system design; Level Set; Photovoltaic; Primary sources; PV system; Road-maps; Solar illumination; Computer simulation; Design; Engineering education; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hybrid systems; Systems analysis; Light emitting diodes","Fallin, J., Designing DC/DC converters based on SEPIC topology (2008) Analog Applications Journal, Power Management, Texas Instruments Incorporated, 4Q, pp. 18-23; Lin, B.R., Huang, C.L., Analysis and implementation of an integrated SEPIC-forward converter for photovoltaic-based light emitting diode lighting (2009) IET Power Electronics, 2 (6), pp. 635-645; Hodge, B.K., (2010) Alternative Energy Systems & Applications, pp. 114-148. , John Willey & Sons, Inc; Chuang, Y.C., Ke, Y.L., (2008) High Efficiency Battery Charger with A Buck Zero-current Switching Pulse Width Modulated Converter, 1 (4), pp. 433-444; Jovcic, D., Step-up DC-DC converter for megawatt size applications (2009) IET Power Electronics, 2 (6), pp. 675-685; Redley, R., Analyzying the sepic converters (2006) Power System Design Europe, pp. 14-18. , November; Bisogno, F.E., Nittayarumphong, S., Radecker, M., Doprado, R.N., A line power-supply for LED lighting using piezoelectric transformers in class-E topology (2006) Proc.

These ethical and philosophical frameworks are often dormant and unquestioned. During the development of an innovative reality TV mediated engineering design and test project (the Fuelduel 1 project) for undergraduate students ethical issues arose that challenged long-held views on engineering education.

It has sought to define technical writing and throw light on the content and technique of writing the various components of successful technical reports (for example, articles, papers, or research reports, such as theses and dissertations). Then, it has highlighted other special features and principles of effective technical writing. The material in this paper is divided into seven major parts. Part 1 (Technical writing for engineers) stresses that a successful engineering career requires strong writing skills. Part 2 (How to write the major sections or elements of a report) describes the techniques of writing the abstract, introduction, literature review, procedure/methods & materials, results, discussion, conclusion, and recommendations. Part 3 (Special features of technical writing) brings into focus some of the special features of technical writing such as tables & graphs in the text, graphics in instructions, team writing, ethics (plagiarism), document sources, three citation styles and IEEE reference style. Part 4 (Technical usage) deals with writing abbreviations, initialisms and acronyms, numbers, units of measurement, and equations. Part 5 (Technical style) highlights the imperative writing style and other features of technical writing such as the use of active and passive voices, plain vs. complex syntax, avoiding redundant or superfluous expressions, and vague generalities, using words or expressions with visual impact, the past tense to describe experimental work, the present tense to describe hypotheses, principles, theories and truths, and breaking up the text of the report into short sections. Part 6 (Document specifications) emphasizes the technical writer's need to conform to such document specifications as word count, format, font, number of words per line of text imposed. Finally, part 7 (Reader-friendly technical writing) suggests choosing the varied writing modes (patterns of organization of information) to suit the technical writing task, checking for technical accuracy and following three levels of editing to help increase the readability of a technical text. © 2012 IEEE.","effective technical writing; engineering; journal article; research report; technical communication","Engineering careers; Journal articles; Literature reviews; Research reports; Team writing; Technical communications; Technical texts; Technical writers; Visual impacts; Writing skills; Writing style; Abstracting; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Inverse kinematics; Professional aspects; Specifications; Units of measurement; Technical writing","Blake, G., Robert, W., (2000) Bly the Elements of Technical Writing, , New York: Simon & Schuster Macmillan Company; Markel, M., (2001) Instructor's Resource Manual for (Sixth Edition) Technical Communication, , New York: Bedford/St. Martin's; Beer, D., McMurrey, D., (2005) A Guide to Writing As An Engineer, , (2nd ed.).

This evolution allows relationships to be expressed between content in distributed data sets, enabling the way for integration of raw data from multiple knowledge domains and heterogeneous datasets. However, as the Web becomes increasingly populated with linked data, there is also a need to support users with applications to visualize or to explore available data for a specific task, especially in mobile applications. Examples of these tasks are consuming linked data, or creating new semantic relations between data entities, people and places. With the advent of mobiles, our views and behaviors about access/interaction the Internet are shifting. Specialized applications are available as an important alternative to replace a standard web browser for mobile access. In this article, authors show a three-tier client-server architecture using Android framework. This architecture relies on the RDF data from Linked OpenCourseWare Dataset. Additionally, authors show three proof-of-concept based on architecture which integrates into a common used interface for RDF data management on mobile devices. © 2012 IEEE.","LinkedData; Mobil Architecture; Mobile; OCW; OER; OpenCourseWare; Triplestore","LinkedData; Mobile; OCW; OER; OpenCourseWare; Triple-store; Architecture; Client server computer systems; E-learning; Engineering education; Information management; Mobile devices; Semantic Web; Semantics; Data handling","Johnson, L., Levine, A., Smith, R., (2009) The 2009 Horizon Report, , Austin, Texas: The New Media Consortium; Traxler, J., Current state of mobile learning (2009) Mobile Learning Transforming the Delivery of Education and Training, 5 (2), pp. 9-24. , http://www.aupress.ca/books/120155/ebook/01_Mohamed_Ally_2009-Article1. pdf, Athabasca University Press.

Remote laboratories for education in subjects of control, is a common resorted method, used by universities. This method is applied to offer a flexible service in schedules so as to obtain greater and better results of available resources. Remote laboratories have been used for controlling physical devices remotely. Furthermore, remote labs have been used for transfer function identification of real equipment. Nevertheless, remote analyses of disturbances have not been done. The aim of this contribution is thereby to apply the experience of remote laboratories in the study of disturbances. Some experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness in using remote laboratories for complete analysis of a thermal system. Considering the remote access to thermal system, Sistema de Laboratorios a Distancia (SLD) was used. © 2012 IEEE.","education of control; remote experiment; remote laboratories","Flexible service; Physical devices; Remote access; Remote analysis; Remote experiments; Remote laboratories; Remote labs; Thermal systems; Transfer function identification; Engineering education; Experiments; Laboratories","Gomes, L., Bogosyan, S., Current trends in remote laboratories (2009) Industrial Electronics IEEE Transactions on, 56, pp. 4744-4756; Rodriguez-Andina, J.J., Current trends in industrial electronics education (2010) Industrial Electronics IEEE Transactions on, 57, pp. 3245-3252; Jara, C.A., EJS+EjsRL: An interactive tool for industrial robots simulation, Computer Vision and remote operation (2011) Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 59, pp. 389-401; Fabregas, E., Developing a remote laboratory for engineering education (2011) Computers & Education, 57, pp. 1686-1697; Ferrater-Simon, C., A remote laboratory platform for electrical drive control using programmable logic controllers (2009) Education IEEE Transactions on, 52, pp. 425-435; Cooper, M., Ferreira, J.M.M., Remote laboratories extending access to science and engineering curricular (2009) Learning Technologies IEEE Transactions on, 2, pp. 342-353; Sancristobal, E., Remote labs as learning services in the educational arena (2011) IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1189-1194. , Amman; Jara, C.A., Real-time collaboration of virtual laboratories through the Internet (2009) Computers & Education, 52, pp. 126-140; Puerto, R., Remote control laboratory via Internet using Matlab and Simulink (2010) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 18, pp. 694-702; Vargas, H., Docencia en Automática: Aplicación de las TIC a la realización de actividades prácticas a través de Internet a la realización de actividades prácticas a través de Internet (2010) Revista Iberoamericana de Automática e Informática Industrial (RIAI), 7, pp. 35-45; Dormido, R., Vargas, H., Duro, N., Sanchez, J., Dormido-Canto, S., Farias, G., Esquembre, F., Dormido, S., Development of a web-based control laboratory for automation technicians: The three-tank system (2008) IEEE Transactions on Education, 51 (1), pp. 35-44. , DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.893356, Special Issue on Virtual Laboratories; Rojko, A., Power engineering and motion control web laboratory: Design, implementation, and evaluation of mechatronics course (2010) Industrial Electronics IEEE Transactions on, 57, pp. 3343-3354; Rojko, A., Mechatronics E-course for regular students and adults: Realization and comparison of efficiency (2010) IEEE Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 959-966. , Madrid; Yuliang, Q., Design and implementation of a serviceoriented web-based control laboratory (2009) Systems, Man and Cybernetics 2009.

Amongst the learning outcomes of this module is the understanding and use of B-Splines, Bezier Curves, Free Form Deformation (FFD), hierarchal modeling, and inverse and forward kinematics. Such concepts appear to be challenging to students and demanding to the instructors. In this paper we present an intuitive, practical and non-mathematical approach to teach students these concepts. During the lecture, and before introducing the formal definitions of these topics, the students are asked to carry out simple and short activities using an appropriate software tool. These activities are closely related to the topic to be discussed and followed by questions and discussion. Finally, formal definitions are introduced to give a mathematical meaning to what the students have already done. Overall, results indicate that engaging students in practical activities and reflecting on these activities help them better understand some of the challenging mathematical theories. © 2012 IEEE.","Active Learning; CGA; Computer Graphics; FFD; Teaching Mathematics","Active Learning; B splines; Bezier curve; CGA; Engaging students; FFD; Formal definition; Forward kinematics; Free-form deformation; Interactive 3D animations; Interactivity; Learning by doing; Learning outcome; Mathematical concepts; Mathematical theory; Animation; Engineering education; Interpolation; Mathematical techniques; Students; Computer graphics","Alley, T., Laxer, C., Flaxman, T., Geigel, J., Gold, S., Hitchner, L., Orr, G., Pollack, B.W., Knowledge base for the emerging discipline of computer graphics (2006) ACM SIGGRAPH 2006 Educators Program, Ser.

It has the ability to offer training sessions for different operating systems and networking techniques that are used to build hybrid IT infrastructure solutions. Topologies consisting of machine servers equipped with different operating systems such as Linux, Windows, Solaris etc. that are coupled with each other through different network components and devices, presents an IT infrastructure solution. Such a laboratory will solve many of the problems facing students in developing countries, as academic institutions are not equipped with the appropriate platforms and network components for teaching IT. Moreover, IT departments of business enterprises or IT academic institutions will save big amounts of money as there is no necessity to purchase such expensive systems. Currently, the first prototype is being built using VMware ESX server, VMware vSphere client, GNS3, among others. The development environments used have the capability to manage large pools of virtualized computing infrastructure, including software and hardware.

The OOML is a WYGIWYM (what you get is what you mean) tool that allows the fast development of 3D objects for fabrication on a 3D Printer. Designing with a WYGIWYM paradigm help students to communicate and reason geometrically, by applying geometry in real-world settings, and by solving problems through the integrated study of number systems, geometry, algebra, data analysis, probability, and trigonometry. These designed objects can be converted to STL files. The STL file can be used in 3D printers for fast prototyping or with traditional mechanization processes. We have designed and evaluated with students the OOML. Results show that the OOML plus the 3D Printer boosts their creativity. As a non searched result, we have observed that OOML also helps students to understand better the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm. © 2012 IEEE.",,"3D object; 3D printers; Fast prototyping; Mechanical design; Number system; Object oriented; Open sources; STL file; Engineering education; Machinery; Numbering systems; Object oriented programming; Printing presses; Students; Three dimensional","Bradshaw, S., Bowyer, A., Haufe, P., The intellectual property implications of low-cost 3D Printing (2010) SCRIPTed, 5. , http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol7-1/bradshaw.asp, [Online]; Bowyer, A., The self-replicating rapid prototyper, manufacturing for the masses (2007) 8th National Conference on Rapid Design, Prototyping & Manufacturing, , June; De Bruijn, E., (2010) On the Viability of the Open Source Development Model for the Design of Physical Objects.

Students' evaluations are based on the grades scored from administrative tests, quizzes and assignments are convenient as it provides a summative measure of students' cognitive ability. However, such measure is said be lacking in precision and low in reliability when measuring achievement levels of individual students. The aim of this paper is to reassess the method of evaluation by taking into account of the measurements of items and linear measures for persons and items. Using the stochastic Rasch model, performance of the matriculation students in the Physics examination paper is examined. The study suggests that the item model gives a good fit but persons and items measurement gives a fair fit. The measurement also indicates that a number of students encounter significant difficulties in grasping some of the fundamental topics in physics. These findings provide valuable insights into the structure and functionality of the examination paper. In general terms, it provides useful information in ensuring quality delivery of teaching and learning at the matriculation level. © 2012 IEEE.","higher learning; items; matriculation; Rasch Model; teaching and learning","Cognitive ability; Engineering course; Higher learning; items; Malaysia; matriculation; Teaching and learning; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Stochastic models","Saidfudin, M., Easier learning outcomes analysis using rasch model in engineering education research (2010) Latest Trends on ENGINEERING EDUCATIon, pp. 442-447; Osman, S.A., Assesment on Students Performance Using Rasch Model in Reinforced Concrete Design Course Examination (2010) Recent Researches in Education, pp. 193-198; Hamzah, A., Ghulman, S.M., Modern Measurement Pradgim in Engineering Education: Easier to Read and Batter Analysis Using Rash-based Approach; Hamzah, N., Poor student performance in project management course: Was the exam wrongly set?

The faculty believe that these laboratory courses are a defining feature of the bachelor of science degree, as many graduates accept entry-level manufacturing positions or pursue graduate studies. The mechanical engineering laboratory courses at Clemson are stand-alone offerings in the undergraduate program, in contrast those schools which attach the labs to select courses. This structure allows a variety of experiments to be offered during each course, which can encompass various scientific and engineering topics. This paper reviews various changes to the laboratories, describes their implementation and presents evidence of their effectiveness. Examples of the improvements were: the development of printed manuals for both students and teaching assistants, the development of a unified training program for the teaching assistants, the introduction of new laboratory equipment and experiments, and revision of the current laboratory documentation. To evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented changes, survey results were analyzed.

The teaching methodology used is aimed at motivating students to learn by promoting the design, calculation, building, and testing of structures. This method not only trains students to make calculations, but also develops skills that allow them to understand how structures function. The project includes subjects taught in the third and fifth year of the course. In their third year, students begin their structural training studying structural analysis, where they learn the basics by designing, building, and testing balsa wood structures. Students have access to computer software when optimizing the design of their models before building and testing them in the laboratory. After this first approach to structural analysis, students receive training on more advanced concepts. A few examples of such concepts are the dynamic behavior of structures and instabilities in specific types of structures such as plates and laminar structures, and in structural materials such as steel and concrete. Before completing their studies, students are exposed to a project-based teaching methodology in the area of experimental structural analysis, where students deal with similar projects to those they will face as professionals after graduating. This paper explains the advantages of this methodology for teaching in engineering. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Engineering education; Project-based learning; Structural analysis","Dynamic behaviors; Innovative teaching; Laminar structure; Mechanical engineering program; Project based learning; Project-based; Teaching methodologies; Wood structure; Design; Engineering education; Personnel training; Structural analysis; Wooden buildings; Students","Aparicio, A.C., Ruiz-Teran, A.M., Tradition and innovation in teaching structural design in civil engineering (2007) J.

The purpose of this study was to determine how many hours per week students spent both in and out of class and how the students spent their time when not in class or studying. Another purpose of this study was to provide a methodology for tracking how much time students spend on their course work that could be applied at other universities to monitor academic stress and rigor. Several data sources were used to gather data on how the students were spending their time: Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) surveys, end-of-semester course surveys, the recommended curriculum for each semester, and time logs. Overall, the data indicate that the amount of time students devote to their course work has fluctuated throughout the years. In six out of the eight semesters that students are in the program, they were found to study more often in 2011 than they did in 2004. The students were found to spend approximately 3-4 hours a week on their course work outside of class, or approximately 1-1.25 hours outside of class for every hour spent in-class. The only semester that showed consistent decline was the spring of senior year. This decrease is reflected in all three of the instruments used in the study: the nationwide HERI survey, which is administered senior year; the end-of-semester surveys; and the time logs. The time-log and HERI survey data indicate that students are spending a significant amount of time on leisure activities, as opposed to extracurricular activities or paid work. Curricular changes, which were made over the time period considered in this study, were reflected in the data - indicating that these methods can be used to monitor and assess academic rigor and make data-driven curricular decisions. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Curricula; Engineering education; Time on task","Bachelor of science; Data-sources; Extracurricular activities; Higher education; Leisure activities; Survey data; Time log; Time on task; Time-periods; Civil engineering; Curricula; Digital storage; Engineering education; Surveys; Students","(2011) Find An Accredited Program, , http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx, ABET, Inc.

Industrial sponsorship of students and degree programmes is one way of contributing towards the developing University-Industry (U-I) links. This study highlights the issues of the relationship between employers and students during their undergraduate study from the perspective of students, employers and academic staff. It takes a mixed-method approach to assess the attitudes and perception of individuals from these parties and identify the barriers which limit further engagement in order to propose guidelines for further improvements. Data were collected from the undergraduate engineering students, companies, and the academic staff of engineering departments at Loughborough University using questionnaires, interviews and documentary analysis. The results show that greater awareness of the details of sponsorship schemes, including how they work and what is involved, would make employers more likely to offer sponsorship and encourage more students to apply for sponsorship. Conclusions are drawn on recommendations to develop sponsorship schemes in the way that the parties' expectations are met and their benefits maximized. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Employers-students links; Engineering education; Industrial sponsorship; Professional skills","Academic staff; Employers-students links; Engineering department; High quality; Industrial sponsorship; Loughborough University; Professional skills; Undergraduate engineering; Undergraduate engineering students; Undergraduate study; Engineering education; Industry; Surveys; Students","Ojewale, B.A., Ilori, M.O., Oyebisi, T.O., Akinwumi, I.O., Industry-academic relation: Utilization of idle capacities in polytechnics, universities and research organizations by entrepreneurs in Nigeria (2001) Technovation, 21 (10), pp. 695-704. , PII S0166497200000419; Taylor, C.W., Improving industry-university interactions for meaningful R&D (2001) IEEE Computer Applications in Power, 14 (1), pp. 7-9; Chadha, D., A curriculum model for transferable skills development, Engineering Education (2006) Journal of the Higher Education Academy Engineering Subject Centre, 1 (1); (2007) Education Engineering for 21st Century, , The Royal Academy of Engineering, The Royal Academy of Engineering, London; Santoro, M.D., Chakrabarti, A.K., Firm size and technology centrality in industry-university interactions (2002) Research Policy, 31 (7), pp. 1163-1180; Sainsbury, L., (2007) The Race to the Top, , HM Treasury, London; Gordon, A., Hutt, R., Pearson, R., Industrial sponsorship of engineering undergraduates (1985) Studies in Higher Education, 10, pp. 33-42; (1966) Industry and the Universities: Aspects of Interdependence : Report of Proceedings, , Confederation of British Industry, Association of Commonwealth Universities, London; Leitch, S., (2006) Leitch Review of Skills: Prosperity for All in the Global Economy - World Class Skills, , HM Treasury, London; Robinson, I., Bramhall, M., Rowe, R., Engineering education: The UK challenge (2007) ASEE; Bowen, E., Prior, J., Lloyd, S., Thomas, S., Newman-Ford, L., Engineering more engineers - Bridging the mathematics and careers advice gap (2007) HE Academy Engineering Subject Centre, 2 (1), pp. 23-32; Lambert, R., (2003) Lambert Review of Business-university Collaboration, , HM Treasury, London; Roberts, G., (2002) SET for Success.

A web base online survey tool was prepared and 251 inquiry sheets were statistically analyzed. Univariate analyses were performed to describe the interns' population and their needs. Levene's test was used to test equality of variances and the t-value was used for equality of means. The One-Way ANOVA procedure was used to test the hypothesis that the means of groups are not significantly different. Finally, binary logistic regression was conducted to identify factors that predict the students' satisfaction level.A positive, statistically significant relationship was identified between internship satisfaction level, future carrier planning multidisciplinary team working, learning theoretical and practical applications, food service during the internship period and worksite internship. This study proved that the civil engineering students are keen to participate in practical training programs during their period of education and also that civil engineering departments should update the theoretical courses taking into consideration the practical applications. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Civil engineering internship;

The aim of Medialogy is to facilitate creativity within technical solutions, and thus the intention of this paper is to answer the following: What is the Medialogy students' perception of creativity and in which part of the process of problem solving do they view themselves as being creative? In Medialogy, the education explicitly focuses on the little-c creativity and communicates the everyday life and evolutionary creativity to the students. The Medialogy students also perceive creativity as the little-c creativity that contains something interpersonal and intrapersonal, and by means of which products can be developed. They do not regard creativity as focusing on interaction and social context. They perceive that they are creative during all stages in the project work. However, it is also significant that the Medialogy students believe that they are more creative in the beginning of their projects and during the design and implementation stages, whereas the analysis is a less creative part. In general, the Medialogy students request further tools for creativity as well as more support for the creative process from the supervisors. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Creativity; Engineering education; Perception; Problem based learning; Project work","Aalborg University; Creative process; Creativity; Cross-disciplinary; Problem based learning; Project work; Social context; Technical solutions; Education; Engineering education; Sensory perception; Students","Ott, M., Pozzi, F., Towards a model to evaluate creativityoriented learning activities (2010) Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2, pp. 3532-2536; Amabile, T., How to kill creativity (1998) Harvard Business Review, pp. 77-87. , September-October; Zhou, C., Luo, L., Du, X., Kolmos, A., Factors influencing group creativity in project-organized teams in engineering education in China (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (6), pp. 1524-1535; Feagin, J., Orum, A., Sjoberg, G., (1991) A Case for Case Study, , University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, NC; Lazar, J., Feng, J.H., Hochheiser, H., (2010) Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction, , Wiley; Likert, R., A technique for the measurement of attitudes (1932) Archives of Psychology, 120, pp. 1-55; Torrance, E.P., Can we teach children to think creatively?

This paper reports on a unique form of computer-based online learning module, designed to help engineering undergraduates learn difficult concepts in the thermal and transport sciences (specifically, heat transfer, mass diffusion, and microfluidics). The design of these modules has been informed by relevant research on cognitive psychology and technology-enhanced learning. Specifically, the modules are based on the prior work of Chi and Slotta, which focuses on helping students understand the emergent properties of complex physical systems, thereby providing a means for promoting conceptual change within these challenging domains. The modules were designed and hosted in a Web-based learning management system, where a variety of interactive materials and inquiry prompts were incorporated to help students better understand the concepts and visualize the phenomena. Engineering students' perceptions of computerbased online learning are reported along with learning outcomes that resulted from their use of the modules. This was the first study to provide a discipline-based example in engineering education for how to use computer-based online learning and emergent properties of complex systems to help undergraduate engineering students learn difficult concepts. It has implications for (1) designing effective online learning environments to help students learn difficult science and engineering concepts; and (2) developing effective instructional strategies for promoting conceptual change. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Conceptual change; Engineering education; Misconceptions; Online learning","Cognitive psychology; Complex physical systems; Conceptual change; Difficult concepts; Emergent property; Engineering undergraduates; Instructional strategy; Learning outcome; Mass diffusion; Misconceptions; Online learning; Online learning environment; Science and engineering; Technology enhanced learning; Transport science; Undergraduate engineering students; Web based learning; Electronic document exchange; Engineering; Engineering education; Students; E-learning","Miller, R.L., Streveler, R.A., Olds, B., Chi, M.M.T.H., Nelson, A., Geist, M.R., Misconceptions about rate processes: Preliminary evidence for the importance of emergent conceptual schemas in thermal and transport sciences (2006) Proceedings of American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Chicago, IL.

In addition to possessing content knowledge, this requires them to be adept in professional skills, including written and verbal communication skills, team building and leadership, and to have an understanding of relevant global issues. A growing awareness exists among educators for the need to better equip students with professional skills for the changing workplace. Student perceptions related to the importance of these topics, and to their coverage in the formal curriculum have however, not been examined. A comparative study between graduate students from three disciplines (Engineering Education and Biology) is reported that quantifies these perceptions. A Likert survey was administered to graduate students in Engineering, Education and Biology, to determine their perceptions of the importance of professional skills to their careers, and whether such skills were addressed in their undergraduate and graduate curricula. Students from all disciplines rated professional skills as very important, and they also emphasized the lack of attention to these topics in their formal curricula. Interestingly, Engineering students rated pedagogy and interpersonal communication skills and proposal writing lower compared with students in Education and Biology. Engineering should investigate how the other disciplines incorporate content related to some of these important professional skills into their curricula. Other implications of the study for engineering students and educators are also discussed. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Global workplace; Professional skills; Proposal development","College graduates; Comparative studies; Content knowledge; Global issues; Global workplace; Graduate curricula; Graduate students; Inter-personal communications; Professional skills; Proposal development; Proposal writing; Student perceptions; Team building; Verbal communications; Biology; Communication; Curricula; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students","(1998) Engineering Criteria 2000, , Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc., ABET, Baltimore MD; (2005) Restructuring Engineering Education: A Focus on Change, , National Science Foundation, Division of Undergraduate Education, Education and Human Resources, NSF; Tenopir, C., King, D.W., (2004) Communication Patterns of Engineers, , IEEE/Wiley InterScience, New York; Chubin, D., Donaldson, K., Olds, B., Fleming, L., Education generation net - Can U.S. engineering woo and win the competition for talent?

Leadership programmes in engineering education have been implemented in various formats with varying degrees of success. It has already been identified in research studies that 80-90% of engineering leadership programmes offered explicitly across the globe were based in the United States of America. However, in Europe and Australia, there is a noticeable lack of engineering leadership programmes, particularly in undergraduate curricula.

The attitude of the students towards computers and experience of using the computers are very important factors that may affect the students' adoption of simulation-based laboratory. In addition to those factors, prior knowledge and preferences on the engineering simulation software are also significant determinants that may influence the adoption of simulation lab exercise among the students. At the same time, different learning styles (cognitive) may affect how a student performs in different lab settings. Many researches have been conducted investigating the elements involved in adoption of computer applications but less work has been done looking into those elements in adoption of simulation lab exercise among engineering students. This research brings new sight in engineering education specifically in simulation-based laboratory. In this article, we investigate the relationship between students' attitude towards computer, experience in computer usage, students' preferences and prior knowledge on simulation software, students' cognitive style and adoption of the simulation lab exercise among Electronics-Telecommunications engineering students of Multimedia University, Malaysia. A conceptual model was designed to study the correlations among the variables in the model. The findings from the investigation indicated that all the factors-variables-have positive and significant relationships with the adoption of simulation lab exercise among the respondents in this study expect for the students' attitude towards computer and their preference of using engineering simulation software. Different cognitive styles among the students did not have any effects on their attitude towards computer and adoption to simulation-based laboratory except for the kinesthetic style on adoption to simulation lab. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cognitive; computer attitude; simulation software; simulation-based laboratory","cognitive; Cognitive styles; Computer attitude; Conceptual model; Engineering simulation; Learning Style; Malaysia; Physical laboratory; Prior knowledge; Simulation software; Simulation-based; Computer simulation; Engineering education; Laboratories; Professional aspects; Research; Students; Computer software","Mitra, A., Lenzmeier, S., Steffensmeier, T., Avon, R., Qu, N., Hazen, M., Gender and computer use in academic institution: Report from longitudinal study (2000) J Educ Comput Res, 23, pp. 67-84; Newby, M., Fisher, D., A model of the relationship between university computer laboratory environment and student outcomes (2000) Learn Environ Res, 3, pp. 51-66; Ertugrul, N., Towards virtual laboratories: A survey of LabView-based teaching/learning tools and future trends (2000) Int J Eng Educ, 16, pp. 171-180; Palaigeorgiou, G.E., Siozos, P.D., Konstantakis, N.I., Tsoukalas, I.A., A computer attitude scale for computer science freshmen and its educational implications (2005) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 21 (5), pp. 330-342. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2005.00137.x; Lim, K.S., (1999) Impacts of Computer Experience and Attitude on Task Perception, User Satisfaction and Performance; Schraw, G., Brooks, D., Crippen, K.J., Improving chemistry instruction using an interactive, compensatory model of learning (2005) Journal of Chemical Education; Rose, D., Meyer, A., Teaching every student in the digital age: Universal Design for Learning (2002) Alexandria, VA, ASCD; Cronbach, L.J., (2002) Remaking the Concept of Aptitude: Extending the Legacy of Richard E.

The research was undertaken as part of an Australian Learning and Teaching Council project on Australian dual degrees. The findings suggest that biomedical engineering offerings in the United States tend to treat biomedical engineering as a separate discipline in itself, with distinct methodological and analytical techniques. Many universities in the United Kingdom offer courses specifically in medical engineering and/or biomedical engineering made up of core engineering subjects together with specialist biomedical engineering subjects or medical engineering subjects. A limited number of Australian universities offer degrees specifically in biomedical engineering. Australian dual degrees tend to offer standard engineering subjects alongside standard medical science subjects, and the structure can prevent students from choosing subjects that specialise in the area of biomedical engineering. It can be concluded that Australian dual degrees can be a poor choice for students who wish to progress in the field of biomedical engineering. © 2012 WIETE.",,"Analytical techniques; Australia; Core engineering; Dual-degrees; Medical engineering; Medical science; United kingdom; Biophysics; Engineering education; Medicine","Baselli, G., Biomedical engineering education at Politecnico di Milano: development and recent changes (2009) Proc.

Through, for example, scientometrics and social network analysis, 512 CDIO-related papers by Chinese scholars from 2005 to 2011 were analysed to grasp how CDIO has developed in China. The outcomes on CDIO were studied from the numbers of papers a year, involvement of university groups, numbers of cited papers, etc. Also, the co-occurrence network of CDIO-related keywords was constructed and analysed.

E-scape (e-solutions for creative assessment in portfolio environments) is centred on two innovations. The first concerns a web-based approach to portfolio building; allowing learners to build their portfolios in real-time, directly from hand-held peripheral technologies in studios, workshops, laboratories, and from off-site settings. The second concerns the development of a radical webbased approach to the assessment of performance as captured in these portfolios. In many parts of the world, portfolios feature as part of school-based assessments-including those undertaken for school-leaving and certification purposes. In this setting assessment reliability is critical and (judged by practice in England &Wales) is typically far from satisfactory. The approach developed within e-scape has radically improved assessment reliability. Whilst these two innovations represent the most dramatic outcomes of the project, they arose from a set if principles held by the team of researchers in the Technology Education Research Unit (TERU) at Goldsmiths University of London. And central to these principles is that both the portfolio and the assessment approaches should be embedded in a view of active learning, such that engagement with them has a positive impact on classroom practice. As the title suggests, this paper outlines the origins, underlying principles and early development of project e-scape. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Collaborative learning; Comparative judgement; Creative; Hand-held-digital; Performance assessment; Web-portfolio","Collaborative learning; Comparative judgement; Creative; Hand-held-digital; Performance assessment; Web-portfolio; Engineering education; Innovation; Rating","Black, P., William, D., (2003) Assessment for Learning, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Calvez, J.P., Wyche, A., Edmundson, C., (1993) Embedded Real-time Systems, , New York: Wiley; (2005) Harnessing Technology: Transforming Learning and Children's Services: DFES E-strategy, , www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/e-strategy, Department for Education & Skills (DFES); Drabble, G., The identification of factors contributing to the relative underachievement of boys in design and technology (2000) Loughborough: Qualifications & Curriculum Authority (QCA) Moderators Conference; Hillary, N., Measuring performance for real-time systems (2005) Document Number: GRNTEEPFRMNCWP 1-800-521-6274, , 480-768-2130 Freescale Semiconductor Literature Distribution Center P.O.

This study observes two first year modules of the undergraduate programmes that focused on the development of subject knowledge and practical craft skills. Broadening the educational experience and perspective of students to include design based aptitudes demanded a clear aligning of educational approaches with learning outcomes. As design is a complex iterative learning process it requires a dynamic assessment tool to facilitate and capture the process. Considering the critical role of assessment in the learning process, the study explored the relevance of individual student-defined assessment criteria and the validity of holistic professional judgement in assessing capability within a design activity. The kernel of the paper centres on the capacity of assessment criteria to change in response to how students align their work with evidence of capability. The approach also supported peer assessment, where student-generated performance ranks provided an insight into not only how effectively they evidenced capability but also to what extent their peers valued it. The study investigated the performance of 137 undergraduate teachers during an activity focusing on the development of design, processing and craft skills. The study validates the use of adaptive comparative judgement as a model of assessment by identifying a moderate to strong relationship with performance scores obtained by two different methods of assessment. The findings also present evidence of capability beyond the traditional measures. Level of engagement, diversity, and problem solving were also identified as significant results of the approach taken. The strength of this paper centres on the capacity of student-defined criterion assessment to evidence learning, and concludes by presenting a valid and reliable holistic assessment supported by comparative judgements. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Comparative pairs; Holistic assessment; Teacher education; Technology education","Assessment criteria; Comparative pairs; Craft skills; Design activity; Dynamic assessment; Educational approach; Educational experiences; First year; Holistic assessment; Iterative learning process; Learning outcome; Learning process; Peer assessment; Professional judgement; Teacher education; Technology education; Undergraduate programmes; Curricula; Design; Education computing; Engineering education; Rating; Teaching; Students","Banks, F., Barlex, D., Jarvinen, E., O'Sullivan, G., Owen Jackson, G., Rutland, M., DEPTH-developing professional thinking for technology teachers: An International Study (2004) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 14, pp. 141-157; Barlex, D., Creativity in school design and technology in England: A discussion of influences (2007) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 17, pp. 149-162; Barlex, D.M., Trebell, D., Design-without-make: Challenging the conventional approach to teaching and learning in a design and technology classroom (2008) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 18 (2), pp. 119-138. , DOI 10.1007/s10798-007-9025-5; Baynes, K., Models of change: The future of design education.

The methodology claims to offer a number of educational benefits. This paper evaluates the student perceptions of the initial and second offering of a first-year design unit at Griffith University in Australia. It builds on an earlier evaluation conducted after the initial offering of the unit. It considers the implementation of the recommended changes. Evaluations of the two offerings reveal that students (in both the initial and second offering) generally enjoyed the experience, but that the second offering was found to be a significantly more enjoyable learning experience. Students in the second offering also reported a significantly better understanding of what they needed to do for the design projects and where to find the requisite information. The oral presentation aspect of the initial and second offerings received the lowest satisfaction rating. The inclusion (and delivery) of the computer-aided drawing component of the unit is seen as a positive aspect by some students, but many others comment on it negatively. The best aspects of the PBL unit and those aspects needing further improvement were similar to the findings of other investigations documented in the literature. © 2012 Copyright SEFI.","engineering education; evaluation; project-based learning","Australia; Computer-aided drawings; Design projects; Educational benefits; Engineering design education; Engineering undergraduates; evaluation; First-year; Learning experiences; Oral presentations; Project based learning; Student perceptions; Student-centred; Students; Technical presentations; Engineering education","Beer, D.F., Reflections on why engineering students don't like to write - and what we can do about it , pp. 364-368. , IEEE international professional communication conference, New York: IEEE; Doppelt, Y., Assessment of project-based learning in a mechatronics context (2005) Journal of Technology Education, 16 (2), pp. 7-24; Du, X., Kolmos, A., Increasing the diversity of engineering education - a gender analysis in a PBL context (2009) European Journal of Engineering Education, 34 (5), pp. 425-437; Dym, C.L., Engineering design thinking, teaching, and learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 103-120; Edward, N.S., Evaluations of introducing project-based design activities in the first and second years of engineering courses (2004) European Journal of Engineering Education, 29 (4), pp. 491-503; Frank, M., Lavy, I., Elata, D., Implementing the project-based learning approach in an academic engineering course (2003) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 13 (3), pp. 273-288; Garbett, D., (2004) Researching practice as a teacher educator, , http://www.aare.edu.au/04pap/gar04590.pdf, [online].

Problem-based learning (PBL) is claimed to be a suitable approach to develop such skills. The graduates were interviewed some months after starting work, along with their managers. All the graduates recognised the benefits of taking PBL subjects as well as vacation work, with success in communication attributed more to PBL. Both cohorts had similar learning outcomes, high skill levels in project management, problem solving, communication skills, research and sustainability. A skills gap in ethics was identified for both cohorts of graduates and their managers.

While some engineering projects may require discipline-specific specialists, the vast majority of engineering practice is carried out either by an engineering team of mixed disciplines, or by individual engineers who are competent across multiple fields. In both Canada and the US, engineering accreditation boards have recognized the need for students to develop at least a modest level of competency to function in multidisciplinary teams prior to graduation. Recognizing the growing need for enhanced design education and multidisciplinary competency for undergraduate students, in 2005 Queen's University introduced an elective series of courses known as the Multidisciplinary Design Stream (MDS), available to students from all engineering disciplines. The first course in the stream is offered over one term at the third year level and incorporates a broad range of lecture topics and interactive learning activities that are further reinforced with a concurrent design project in multidisciplinary teams of four students. The continuing course spans the final two terms at the fourth year level and enhances students' design, professional, and problem solving skills through their application in multidisciplinary teams on funded, industry sponsored projects. Every team is supervised by one or more faculty members or 'engineers in residence', all of whom have significant engineering professional practice experience. The MDS has been filled to capacity since its second year of operation. Student feedback after graduation is very positive, and client response has typically been outstanding, reinforced with a very high rate of year over year client return. Student surveys and a design skills assessment provide significant evidence of increased design competency. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Capstone; Design; Design education; Engineering education; Industry project; Integrated learning; Multidisciplinary; Professional practice; Team design project","Capstone; Design Education; Industry project; Integrated learning; Multidisciplinary; Professional practices; Team designs; Accreditation; Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Reinforcement; Teaching; Students","(1999) The Evolution of Engineering Education in Canada, , http://www.acad-eng-gen.ca/publis/e/Evolution_a.1.cfm, December; Dym, C.L., Agogino, A.M., Eris, O., Frey, D.D., Leifer, L.J., Engineering design thinking, teaching, and learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 103-120. , January; Grinter, L.E., Report of the committee on evaluation of engineering education (1952) Journal of Engineering Education, 46 (1), pp. 25-60; Todd, R.H., Sorensen, C.D., Magleby, S.P., Designing a senior capstone course to satisfy industrial customers (1993) Journal of Engineering Education, 82 (2), pp. 92-100. , April; Eggert, R.J., Engineering design education: Surveys of demand and supply (2003) ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition: Staying in Tune with Engineering Education, pp. 1901-1912. , American Society for Engineering Education, Nashville, TN, United States, June; Frise, P.R., Sirizzotti, M.D., Gaspar, R.G., Reader, G.T., Mechanical engineering skills needs in Canadian industry (2002) Annual Conference of the Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineers, pp. 92-100. , Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, May; May, E., Strong, D.S., Preparing our students for success in industry: A proposal for change (2007) The Canadian Design Engineering Network Annual Conference, , Winnipeg, Manitoba; (2010) Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, , http://www.abet.org/Linked%20Documents-UPDATE/Criteria%20and%20PP/ E001%2010-11%20EAC%20Criteria%201-27-10.pdf, Cycle; (2010) Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board, Accreditation Criteria and Procedures, , http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/files/ Accreditation_Criteria_Procedures_2010.pdf; McCowan, J.D., Mason, J.L., Creating a facility for developing professional skills (2002) ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition: Vive L'Ingenieur, pp. 10627-10633. , Montreal, Quebec, Canada, June; Strong, D.S., McCowan, J.D., Effective workspace for engineering education: The integrated learning centre at Queen's University in Kingston (2005) 2nd Annual Canadian Design Engineering Network Conference, , Kananaskis, Alberta, July; Frank, B., Mason, J.L., (2008) Impact of Peer-managed Project-based Learning in First Year, , ASEE Annual Conferenceand Exposition, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Chairs in Design Engineering Program, , http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/CFS-PCP/CDE-CGC_eng. asp; Frank, B., Strong, D.S., Development of a design skill assessment tool (2010) The Inaugural Canadian Engineering Education Association Conference, , http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/PCEEA/article/view/3165/3103, Kingston, Ontario, Canada","Strong, D.S.; Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, , Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; email: strongd@queensu.ca",0949149X,,,"English","Int.

Although entrepreneurship education is believed to be complementary to an engineering education, little is known about the degree to which it plays a role in contemporary students' academic programs. The purpose of this study was to explore a broad array of attitudes toward and outcomes of entrepreneurship education on engineering students in order to understand the characteristics of students participating in related courses and activities, the nature and extent of their involvement, entrepreneurship's role in their career plans, and its impact on entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Survey data were collected from 501 engineering students enrolled in senior-level capstone design courses at three institutions with established entrepreneurship programs. The study found that while two-thirds or more of engineering students intended to work for medium or large size companies after graduation, a similar number felt that entrepreneurship education could broaden their career prospects and choices. Less than one third of those surveyed felt that entrepreneurship was being addressed within their engineering programs or by engineering faculty. Students who had taken one or more entrepreneurship courses showed significantly higher levels of entrepreneurial self-efficacy on a number of measures.

Innovating in this domain relies on interrupting existing patterns. This interruption requires the conscious recognition of patterns through an active practice of self observation. Though self observation does not necessarily need a collective process, it is served by encountering the diversity of views present in groups. Innovation in this sense consists of a fundamental identity shift in the human system and the innovators themselves. Unlike the processes of problem solving and process improvement, transformational innovation requires insight into the individual and collective attention of the designers. It also allows access to unexamined mental models and apparent cause and effect relationships. The praxis of transformational innovation within organizations looks like an active practice of reflection, experimentation and learning within the human system. We explain the theoretical perspective, suggest a protocol to begin experimenting with self observation for the purpose of pattern interruption, summarize preliminary results from a year-long process of action research involving over 25 university agents in such a change process, and comment on the limitations and risks in the protocol. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Disruptive innovation; Innovation; Transformational innovation","Action research; Cause-and-effect relationships; Change process; Collective process; Disruptive innovations; Human system; Mental model; Process Improvement; Self-observation; Engineering education; Innovation; Education","Jarad, I.A., Yusof, N.A., Innovation creation and innovation adoption: A proposed matrix towards a better understanding (2010) International Journal of Organizational Innovation, 3 (1), pp. 303-325; Stone, A., Rose, S., Lal, B., Shipp, S., (2008) Measuring Innovation and Intangibles: A Business Perspective, pp. 1-140. , Institute for Defense Analysis: Science and Technology Policy Institute, December; (2007) Defining Innovation: A New Framework to Aid Policy Makers, , ASTRA, Washington D.

SUTD, in collaboration with MIT and Zhejiang University, is striving toestablish a21st century innovation paradigm that recognizes the synergy between innovation and design. Many aspects of such an exciting development are of interest to engineering educators and particularly to design educators and two are covered in this paper. One challenge addressed in this paper is the possibility for conflicting agendas between design-centric education and the goal of becoming a leading research-intensive university. An overview of research intended to address this conflict - that of the International Design Center that is jointly part of MIT and SUTD - is given. It is argued that, rather than conflicting, design-centric education and research-intensity are synergistic for a 21st century university. The second challenge discussed in some depth is the setting of 'culture' for the new institution that encourages bold attempts to improve the world through technical innovation ('innovation culture') with breadth in national cultures ('global culture') bridging from Western to Asian perspectives. Relative to the latter item, a central feature is the 'Eastern Cultural' curriculum items being developed by a second SUTD partner university - Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China). The breadth of national cultures and a wide academic disciplinary base as part of the education process are postulated to be enablers for developing a strong 21st century innovation-leadership-culture for the modern research university. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Culture; Design research; Design theory; Design-centric education; Research-intensive university","Design research; Design theory; Education process; Engineering educators; Hangzhou; Innovation Culture; International designs; National cultures; Research universities; Research-intensive university; Singapore; Technical innovation; University of Technology; Zhejiang University; Cell culture; Design; Research; Engineering education","Ministry of Education.

Motivation and proactive behavior, professional skills (e.g., communication, leadership, business), and creativity in problem solving are among the attributes linked with successful entrepreneurship. An extension of the Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education's Academic Pathways Study, this survey-and interview-based study of engineering undergraduates examines the potential of extracurricular activities to help students develop these entrepreneurial attributes. Quantitative analyses show positive relationships between entrepreneurial attributes and involvement in engineering and non-engineering extracurricular activities. Preliminary interview analyses illustrate how these activities foster entrepreneurial attributes and contribute to students' engineering education experiences, in general. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Entrepreneurship; Extracurricular activities; Undergraduate engineering education","Academic pathways study; Engineering domains; Engineering entrepreneurship; Engineering undergraduates; Entrepreneurship; Extracurricular activities; Interview analysis; Proactive behavior; Professional skills; Technical expertise; Undergraduate engineering educations; Engineering education; Engineering","ABET accreditation commission (2009) Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, , http://www.abet.org/forms.shtml, Retrieved from ABET web site; (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering, Washington, DC: National Academies Press; Atman, C.J., Sheppard, S.D., Turns, J., Adams, R.S., Fleming, L.N., Stevens, R., Streveler, R.A., Lund, D., (2010) Enabling Engineering Student Success: The Final Report for the Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education, , San Rafael, CA: Morgan & Claypool Publishers; Sheppard, S., Atman, C.J., Stevens, R., Fleming, L., Streveler, R., Adams, R.S., Barker, T., Studying the engineering experience: Design of a longitudinal study (2004) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Salt Lake City, UT; Clark, M., Sheppard, S.D., Atman, C.J., Fleming, L., Miller, R., Stevens, R., Streveler, R., Smith, K., Academic pathways study: Processes and realities (2008) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Pittsburgh, PA; Sheppard, S., Gilmartin, S., Chen, H.L., Donaldson, K., Lichtenstein, G., Eris, Ö., Lande, M., Toye, G., (2010) Exploring the Engineering Student Experience: Findings from the Academic Pathways of People Learning Engineering Survey (APPLES) (CAEE-TR-10-01), , Seattle, WA: Center for the Advancement for Engineering Education; Dyer, J.H., Gregersen, H.B., Christensen, C., Entrepreneur behaviors, opportunity recognition, and the origins of innovative ventures (2008) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 2. , doi:10.1002/sej.59; Becherer, R.C., Maurer, J.G., The proactive personality disposition and entrepreneurial behavior among small company presidents (1999) Journal of Small Business Management, 37 (1); Zampetakis, L.A., The role of creativity and proactivity on perceived entrepreneurial desirability (2008) Thinking Skills and Creativity, 3. , doi:10.1016/j.tsc.2008.07.002; Amabile, T.M., Mueller, J.S., Studying creativity, its processes, and its antecedents: An exploration of the componential theory of creativity (2008) Handbook of Organizational Creativity, , J.

Held at Harvey Mudd College in May 2011, and supported by HMC's Center for Design Education and the National Science Foundation, Mudd Design Workshop VIII provided a forum for engineers and designers - in their rolesas educators, researchers, and practitioners interested in learning and in design - to identify and articulate important aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship in design and engineering education. The remarks summarized below were intended to bring to the community's attention the entrepreneurs who developed and implemented some truly innovative ideas in engineering education. Many of these ideas are now 'best practices,' yet the innovators themselves are largely unrecognized. The story of these ideas and their originators also serve to remind us, as members of engineering faculties, that all too often we are remiss in maintain our institutional memories and passing down our own history. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Entrepreneurship; Harvey Mudd College; Innovation","Design Education; Design workshops; Engineering design; Engineering faculty; Entrepreneurship; Harvey Mudd College; Innovative ideas; National Science Foundations; Organizing committee; Design; Engineering education; Innovation","(2011) Oxford English Dictionary, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK; Grinter, L.E., Report on the evaluation of engineering education (1956) Engineering Education, 46, pp. 25-63; Simon, H.A., (1994) The Sciences of the Artificial, , 3rd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; (1958) Curriculum Study: Harvey Mudd College: Science and Engineering, , Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA; Prados, J.W., Can ABET really make a difference?

Although that description has been around for some time, it has seen resurgence in the literature in the past few years with the increased recognition that the problems with which we grapple globally are indeed wicked. Framing of the problem is often the most difficultand important element of dealing with wicked problems, and yet much of our education system focuses on solving rather than framing problems. Recent interest in 'design thinking' focuses on problem framing, and provides a framework for teaching students the skills they need to do problem framing.

Engineering capstonedesign courses are often the only required courses that challenge students to draw on nearly all of the students' previous collegiate learning experiences and to synthesize and apply these to creating a new solution to an engineering problem. Aside from internship and co-op experiences, these are often the first courses that expose engineering students to some of the technical and political issues that they will often face in their professional engineering careers. Industry often looks at these design experiences in addition to work experience when evaluating new graduates. While beneficial, there remains a perceived disconnect between what academia is producing and what industry is seeking. Industry is seeking 'engineers' who are well versed in the application of science to problem solving where as academia is producing 'engineer scientists' who are well versed in the science, but lacking in the application of knowledge gained through experience. While some context-based learning opportunities are emerging much earlier in the engineering curriculum, the needs and means to provide such experiences remain limited. This paper discusses a pilot study that was conducted during the first term of a two term capstone design class in aerospace engineering aircraft design at Virginia Tech. The studyexplored the educational impact of utilizingrealism and simulation to introduce the aircraft design process with the aim of determining if such an approach could help remedy the academia/industry disconnect and at the same time make for an engaging design experience for the students. Results indicate that the use of simulation was welcomed by the participants of the study and can help prepare students to think as working design professionals, not limited by the generic design solutions often found in academic de-contextualized design problems. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Aerospace engineering; Anchored instruction; Engineering education; Simulation","Aircraft design; Aircraft design process; Anchored instruction; Capstone design; Capstone design experience; Co-op experiences; Context-based; Degree program; Design experience; Design problems; Design professionals; Engineering curriculum; Engineering problems; Generic design; Learning experiences; Learning opportunity; Pilot studies; Political issues; Professional engineerings; Simulation; Simulation-based learning; Virginia Tech; Work experience; Aerospace engineering; Aircraft; Engineering education; Industry; Professional aspects; Students; Design","Spurlin, J.E., ABET, ABET criteria for accrediting engineering programs (2006) Designing Better Engineering Education Through Assessment, pp. xix-xxiii. , Stylus, Sterling, VA; Cummings, R.M., McMasters, J.H., Airplane design-past, present, and future (2002) Journal of Aircraft, 39 (1), pp. 10-17; Crawley, E.F., Brodeur, D.R., Soderholm, D.H., The education of future aeronautical engineers: Conceiving, designing, implementing and operating (2008) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 17 (2), pp. 138-151; Lamancusa, J.S., The reincarnation of the engineering 'shop' (2006) ASME 2006 International Design Engineering Technical Conference & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, , Philadelphia, PA; Brodeur, D., Young, P.W., Blair, K.B., Problem-based learning in aerospace engineering education (2002) 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, , Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Koh, C., Tan, H.S., Tan, K.C., Fang, L., Fong, F.M., Kan, D., Lye, S.L., Wee, M.L., Investigating the effect of 3D simulation-based learning on the motivation and performance of engineering students (2010) Journal of Engineering Education, 99 (3), pp. 237-251; Greeno, J.G., Goldman, S.V., Knudsen, J., McDermott, R., Berg, R., Bushey, B., Cole, K., Moschkovick, J.N., The Situativity of Knowing, Learning, and Research (1998) American Psychologist, 53 (1), pp. 5-26; Mosterman, P.J., Dorlandt, M.A.M., Campbell, J.O., Burow, C., Bouw, R., Brodersen, A.J., Bourne, J.R., Virtual engineering laboratories: Design and experiments (1994) Journal of Engineering Education, 83 (3), pp. 279-285; Reamon, D., Sheppard, S., The role of simulation software in an ideal learning environment (1997) ASME Design Theory and Methodology Conference, , Sacramento, CA; Davies, J.M., Helmreich, R.L., Virtual reality in medical training (1997) Canadian Medical Association Journal, 157 (10), pp. 1352-1353; Gibson, S., Fyock, C., Grimson, E., Kanade, T., Kikinis, R., Lauer, H., McKenzie, N., Sawada, A., Volumetric object modeling for surgical simulation (1998) Medical Image Analysis, 2 (2), pp. 121-132; Allerton, D., (2009) Principles of Flight Simulation, , John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., West Sussex, UK; Fang, N., Stewardson, G.A., Lubke, M.M., Enhancing student learning of an undergraduate manufacturing course with computer simulations (2008) International Journal of Engineering Education, 24 (3), pp. 558-566; Squire, K., Klopfer, E., Augmented reality simulations on handheld computers (2007) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 16 (3), pp. 371-413; Johnson, L., Levine, A., Smith, R., Stone, S., (2010) The 2010 Horizon Report, , The New Media Consortium, Austin, Texas; Mackay, S.D., 'U.

In particular, much of engineering education is focused on developing problem-solving skills in situations for which there is an accepted problem-solving paradigm. However, when novel problems arise and a prevailing paradigm ceases to work properly, these problem-solving skills are likely to be ineffective, resulting in inconclusive or flawed results. Future engineers must therefore learn to identify when the prevailing paradigm is flawed and successfully manage such situations in order to solve problems for which no readily available solution exists. To help engineering students develop such skills, educators should likely provide educational experiences that motivate students at both a cognitive and metacognitive level and allow students to recognize potentially flawed paradigms so they can tackle ambiguous and ill-structured problems. In many ways, the skills required for this type of problem-solving parallel the attributes of another class of professionals - entrepreneurs, as entrepreneurs routinely seek to break with accepted norms and pioneer new approaches to problems they observe in their environment. With this analogy in mind, this paper presents results from the implementation of an entrepreneurially oriented case study as a means to enhance engineering student attitudes and perspectives on problem-solving and learning. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Case-based reasoning; Engineering education; Engineering entrepreneurship; Ill-structured problems; Problem-solving","Case-based instructions; Educational experiences; Engineering coursework; Engineering entrepreneurship; Ill-structured problems; Metacognitives; Problem solving skills; Skill sets; Socio-economics; Student attitudes; Engineering; Problem solving; Students; Technical presentations; Engineering education","(2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Enginering NAE, National Academies Press, Washington, D.

The survey asked recruiters to rate 14 key competencies for construction graduates that were identified as important in the literature: ethical issues, problem-solving skills, interpersonal skills, leadership, adaptability, collaborative skills, safety issues, interdisciplinary application, practical awareness, technical skills, computer skills, estimating/scheduling skills, communication, and environmental awareness. A descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis revealed that ethical issues, problem-solving skills, and interpersonal skills were considered by recruiters to be key significant competencies for construction graduates, whereas communication and environmental awareness were ranked lowest. Clustering the 14 key competencies using factor analysis identified four classes of competencies for construction graduates: (1)general competency, (2)affective competency, (3)cognitive competency, and (4)technical competency. These key competencies were compared with accreditation content areas for two major accrediting bodies of construction degrees, and gaps were identified for further investigation. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction; Construction industry; Education; Engineering education","Computer skill; Construction companies; Descriptive statistics; Environmental awareness; Ethical issues; Exploratory factor analysis; Interpersonal skills; Problem solving skills; Safety issues; Technical competencies; Technical skills; Accreditation; Communication; Construction; Education; Employment; Engineering education; Factor analysis; Philosophical aspects; Surveys; Construction industry","Abudayyeh, O., Russell, J., Johnston, D., Rowings, J., Construction engineering and management undergraduate education (2000) J.

By this criterion, a paper that is not cited is automatically assumed to lack both quality and significance. This paper examines the validity of this hypothesis by reviewing citation rates of award-winning ASCE papers over a 25-year period from 1978-2002. In the study, citation data for seven civil engineering subdisciplines were obtained from the Science Citation Index developed by the Thomson Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The analysis showed that nearly 25% of the award-winning papers were never cited with over 30% cited just once. Citations were higher in subdisciplines that are science based and lower in those that are more applied or specialist. These findings indicate that although citations provide a quantitative measure of use, they are imperfect indicators of quality and significance. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","ASCE; Award; Citation; ISI; Uncitedness","ASCE; Award; Citation; ISI; Uncitedness; Engineering education; Civil engineering","Castellano, C., Radicchi, F., On the fairness of using relative indicators for comparing citation performance in different disciplines (2009) Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis, 57 (2), pp. 85-90. , 0004-069X, 10.1007/s00005-009-0014-0; Garfield, E., I had a dreamabout uncitedness (1998) The Scientist, 12 (14), p. 10. , 0890-3670; Hamilton, D.P., Publishing by - And for? - The numbers (1990) Science, 250 (4986), pp. 1331-1332. , 0036-8075 10.1126/science.2255902; Hamilton, D.P., Research papers: Who's uncited now?

The presentation of this innovative experiment refers to the determination of the current voltage characteristic curve of a photovoltaic panel installed on the roof of a laboratory, facing south and with the ability to alter its tilt angle, using a closed loop servo motor mounted on the horizontal axis of the panel. The user has the sense of a direct contact with the system since they can intervene and alter the tilt of the panel and get a live visual feedback besides the remote instrumentation panel. The whole procedure takes a few seconds to complete and the characteristic curve is displayed in a chart giving the student and anyone else interested the chance to analyse the results and understand the respective theory; meanwhile, the test data are stored in a file for future use.

This study examined the perceptions of engineering graduates regarding the difficulties they encountered in their transition from the university to the workplace. Lebanese practising engineers (n=217), living around the world, were surveyed to identify their current employment situations and their attitudes toward their academic preparation. Factor analysis revealed three main challenges facing engineering graduates: communication; responsibility; self-confidence. Seventeen interviews were conducted to gather information on ways to facilitate this transition. Comments reflected the need for better collaboration between engineering schools and engineering firms. The results will provide insight for engineering colleges, faculty members and administrators into the challenges faced by graduates and their aspirations for a smoother transition into employment. © 2012 SEFI.","engineering education; Middle East; transition to career","Academic preparation; Colleges of engineerings; Employment situation; Engineering colleges; Engineering firms; Engineering graduates; Engineering schools; Faculty members; Middle East; Perceptions of engineering; transition to career; Employment; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Engineering education","Akili, W., On industry-academia relations in the Arab Gulf states: steps toward building strategic partnership (2005) Proceedings of the ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education conference, pp. 7-12. , http://file.lw23.com/file1/01611995.pdf, [online], Available from: [Accessed October 2010]; Akili, W., On engineering education in the Arab Gulf States: challenges and imperatives (2008) Proceedings of the 2nd conference on planning & development of education and scientific research in the Arab States, pp. 919-931. , http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/conference/erplanning/Papers/4-007.pdf, [online], Available from: [Accessed October 2010]; Barr, M.J., Upcraft, M.L., (1993) The changing role of career services, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Baytiyeh, H., Naja, M.K., Students' enrolment in engineering: motivational factors (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (5), pp. 1192-1199; Bodgan, R.C., Biklen, S.K., (2007) Qualitative research for education, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education; Bowman, B.A., Farr, J.V., Embedding leadership in civil engineering education (2000) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 126 (1), pp. 16-20; Brooks, L., The relation of career-related work or internship experiences of the career development of college seniors (1995) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 46, pp. 332-349; Chehade, S.M., Lebanon as an engineering educational center in the Middle East (2001) Educating the engineer for the 21st century, , In: Weichert D., Rauhut B., Schmidt R., editors Leiden, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic; Costlow, T., Careers: hiring heats up (2007) IEEE Spectrum, 44 (7), pp. 57-60; Creswell, J.W., (2003) Research design: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Dahlgren, M., From senior student to novice worker: learning trajectories in political science, psychology and mechanical engineering (2006) Studies in Higher Education, 31 (5), pp. 569-586; Deans, J., The educational needs of graduate mechanical engineers in New Zealand (1999) European Journal of Engineering Education, 24 (2), pp. 151-162; Engelland, B.T., Workman, L., Singh, M., Ensuring service quality for campus career services centers: a modified SERVQUAL scale (2000) Journal of Marketing Education, 22 (3), pp. 236-245; Erez, M., Fostering a career in engineering (1981) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 18, pp. 115-120; Fouad, N.A., Need, awareness, and use of career services for college students (2006) Journal of Career Assessment, 14 (4), pp. 407-420; Garavan, T.N., Murphy, C., The co-operative education process and organizational socialization: a qualitative study of student perceptions of its effectiveness (2001) Education and Training, 43, pp. 45-53; Gardner, J.N., Veer, G.V.D., (1998) The senior year experience.

This paper describes a programme aimed at fostering self-regulated learning among high schools pupils working on projects in electronics, control systems and robotics. The programme sought, for example, to promote pupils' conceptual knowledge regarding the subjects they dealt with in their projects, enabling the learners to gain experience using simulation, laboratory testing and troubleshooting in a system that they were constructing. The change in project work also required pupils to document systematically all stages of system development and reflect on their learning by preparing a printed or web-based ePortfolio on the project. Outcomes of the in-service training course given to teachers countrywide and the first signs of change in project work in schools are reported. © 2012 SEFI.","engineering; ePortfolio; projects; self-regulated learning","Conceptual knowledge; E-portfolios; Engineering teachers; High school; In-service training; Instructional methods; Laboratory testing; Learning capabilities; Project based learning; Project work; projects; Self-regulated learning; Subject matters; System development; Technological projects; Education; Engineering; Engineering education","Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York: WH Freeman; Barak, M., Motivating self-regulated learning in technology education (2010) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 20 (4), pp. 381-401; Barron, B.J.S., Doing with understanding: lessons from research on problem- and project-based learning (1998) The Journal of the Learning Sciences, 7 (3-4), pp. 271-311; Blumenfeld, P.C., Motivating project-based learning: sustaining the doing, supporting the learning (1991) Educational Psychologist, 26 (3-4), pp. 369-398; Crismond, D., Scaffolding strategies for integrating engineering design and scientific inquiry in project-based learning environments (2011) Fostering human development through engineering and technology education, pp. 235-256. , In: Barak M., Hacker M., editors Rotterdam: Sense Publishers; Dolmans, D.H., Problem-based learning: future challenges for educational practice and research (2005) Medical Education, 39 (7), pp. 732-741; Flavell, J.H., Metacognition and cognitive monitoring: a new area of cognitive developmental inquiry (1979) American Psychologist, 34 (3), pp. 906-911; Garrett, N., An e-Portfolio design supporting ownership, social learning, and ease of use (2011) Educational Technology & Society, 14 (1), pp. 187-202; Heinrich, E., Bhattacharya, M., Rayudu, R., Preparation for lifelong learning using ePortfolios (2007) European Journal of Engineering Education, 32 (6); Kapp, K., A cultural perspective of teaching and learning ETE in a digitally connected world (2011) Fostering human development through engineering and technology education, pp. 207-232. , In: Barak M., Hacker M., editors Rotterdam: Sense; Kolmos, A., Reflections on project work and problem-based learning (1996) European Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (2), pp. 141-148; McCormick, R., Conceptual and procedural knowledge (1997) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 7 (1-2), pp. 141-159; McCormick, R., Issues of learning and knowledge in technology education (2004) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 14 (1), pp. 21-44; Plants, H.L., A taxonomy of problem-solving activities and its implications for teaching (1980) The teaching of elementary problem-solving in engineering and related fields, pp. 21-34. , In: Lubkin J.

This idea can be supported by looking at different sources, namely, the scientific literature, national and transnational governments' policies, such as those emerging from the Bologna Process. Also, the internationalisation of higher education and, within it, students' and staff mobility among institutions, has brought to the agenda the quality issue, particularly with regard to the teaching and learning process. Several authors argue that the meaning of quality depends on who defines it. This article focuses on a study that looks at how teachers and students in higher education institutions, in Portugal and in the domain of Engineering, see the quality issue. Data was collected through interviews to teachers (six) and students (38) in two different Portuguese institutions. The results indicate that, although teachers and students refer to the same dimensions that influence quality, they have different perspectives about their importance. From the point of view of the authors, this discrepancy requires some pedagogical actions in the context where the study was developed and, also, further research to see if the same tendency exists in different settings. © 2012 SEFI.","engineering education; higher education; quality of education; teachers' and students' perspectives","Bologna process; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Internationalisation; Portugal; Quality of education; Scientific literature; teachers' and students' perspectives; Teaching and learning; Engineering education; Students","Clemet, K., (2003) Mantra or meaning - quality in education and research, , http://www.dep.no/odinarkiv/english/bondevik_II/ufd/045071-090033/dok-bn.html, [online].

Virtual networking laboratories have been very popular in the past few years, especially for training and education of network professionals. These laboratories are emulated computer network environments, based on virtualization technology, and have a number of advantages comparing to classical laboratories. Even with a large number of developed laboratory platforms, there are a small number of attempts to evaluate these systems and to find out how effective they are. This paper presents an approach to the evaluation of the virtual networking laboratory, primarily by the evaluation of its exercises used for a computer-networking course at the university. We are going to employ an approach based on the relation of indiscernibility and the rough set theory in order to produce a model based on if-then rules, starting from low-level data. This model helps to identify the most important parts and eventual mistakes in the evaluated exercises, creating the possibility for their improvement and overall student's achievement as well. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","engineering education; if-then rules; indiscernibility; rough set theory; virtual network laboratories","Computer network environment; Computer network technology; Computer Science Education; If-then rules; Indiscernibility; Laboratory exercise; Model-based OPC; Rough set; Training and education; Virtual networking laboratories; Virtual networks; Virtualizations; Education computing; Engineering education; Laboratories; Rough set theory; Distance education","Gordon, A.D., V for Virtual (2006) Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 162 (1), pp. 177-181. , DOI 10.1016/j.entcs.2006.01.030, PII S1571066106004300; Bullers, Jr.W.I., Burd, S., Seazzu, A.F., Virtual machines-An idea whose time has returned: Application to network, security, and database courses (2006) ACM SIGCSE Bull, 38, pp. 102-106; Dobrilovic, D., Stojanov, Z., Using virtualization software in operating systems course (2006) Proceedings of the 4th IEEE International Conference on Information Technology: Research and Education-ITRE 2006, pp. 222-226. , Tel Aviv, Israel; Balamuralithara, B., Woods, P.C., Virtual laboratories in engineering education: The simulation lab and remote lab (2009) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 17, pp. 108-118; Kuester, F., Hutchinson, T.C., A virtualized laboratory for earthquake engineering education (2007) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 15, pp. 15-129; Gala, F., Fernandez, D., Ruiz, J., Walid, O., De Miguel, T., Use of virtualization tools in computer network laboratories (2004) Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, ITHET 2004, pp. 209-214. , Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, ITHET 2004; Rimondini, M., (2007) Emulation of computer networks with Netkit, RT-DIA-113-2007, , Dipartimento di Informatica e Automazione, Universit'a di Roma Tre, January, Rome, Italy; Valerie, J., Powell, H., Turchek, J., Wu, P., Franzi, L., VLabNet: A virtual laboratory environment for teaching networking and data communications (2007) Proceedings of ISECON 2007, pp. 1-9. , Pittsburgh, USA; Gaspar, A., Langevin, S., Armitage, W., Rideout, M., Enabling new pedagogies in operating systems and networking courses with state of the art open source kernel and virtualization technologies (2008) J Comput Sci Coll, 23, pp. 189-198; Lawson, E.A., Stackpole, W., Does a virtual networking laboratory result in similar student achievement and satisfaction?

Mechatronics is a complex, highly technical and multidisciplinary field involving the design and manufacture of integrated products. Mechatronics course at the undergraduate level is rapidly increasing across the world. Most courses require student teams to design a product. The complexity of student projects can make administration of mechatronics courses extremely difficult. Students develop both practical and theoretical understanding of mechatronics while working on group projects. They also develop the interpersonal and communication skills needed to work in a multi-disciplinary field. This study describes a group project-based approach for enabling teams of students to complete mechatronics projects. A set of heuristic guidelines is also proposed. At the National Changhua University of Education in the Department of Industrial Education and Technology, this approach has yielded high student satisfaction and achievement. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","engineering education; group project-based approach; mechatronics","Communication skills; Group projects; Industrial education; Integrated products; Mechatronics course; Multi-disciplinary; Project-based; Student project; Student satisfaction; Student teams; Curricula; Engineering education; Mechatronics; Product design; Students","Reisman, S., Carr, W.A., Perspectives on multimedia systems in education (1991) IBM Syst J, 30, pp. 280-295; Siegwart, R.Y., Buchi, R., Buhler, P., Mechatronics education at ETH Zurich based on hand on experience (1998) 6th UK Mechatronics Forum International Conference, pp. 667-672; James, P., Mechatronics and automotive systems design (2004) International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 41 (4), pp. 307-312; Wong, L.T., Mui, K.W., To, W.T., Assessment weighting of design project-based subjects for engineering education (2005) World Trans Eng Technol Educ, 4, pp. 215-218; Shyr, W.J., Yao, K.C., Lu, C.Y., Chen, D.F., Development of web-based human interface laboratory platform for mechatronics module (2009) Int J Innovat Comput Inform Control, 5, p. 10; Tsai, C.C., Lin, S.J., Yuan, S.M., Developing science activities through a networked peer assessment system (2002) Comput Educ, 38, pp. 241-252; De Vries, M.J., Technology education: Beyond the technology is applied science paradigm (1996) J Technol Educ, 8, pp. 7-15; Gardner, P.L., The Roots of Technology and Science: A Philosophical and Historical View (1997) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 7 (1-2), pp. 13-20; Singh, S.N., A practical approach to teaching power system transients in the electrical engineering curriculum (2003) Int J Electr Eng Educ, 40, pp. 144-157; Schachterle, L., Vinther, O., Project-oriented engineering education introduction: The role of projects in engineering education (1996) Eur J Eng Educ, 21, pp. 115-132; Dutson, A.J., Todd, R.H., Magleby, S.P., Sorensen, C.D., A review of literature on teaching engineering design through project-oriented capstone courses (1997) J Eng Educ, 76, pp. 17-28; Brereton, M., (1999) The Role of Hardware in Learning Engineering Fundamentals: An Empirical Study of Engineering Design and Product Analysis Activity, , Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University, Stanford; De Graaff, E., Kolmos, A., (2007) Management of Change; Implementation of Problem-based and Project-based Learning in Engineering, p. 221. , Sense Publishers, Rotterdam/Taipei; Snyder, S.D., Using project-based learning to teach PLC programming in mechatronics (2004) World Innovat Eng Educ Res, pp. 277-284; Banerjee, H.K., De Graaff, E., Problem-based Learning in Architecture: Problems of Integration of Technical Disciplines (1996) European journal of engineering education, 21 (2), pp. 185-196; Chiu, D.M., Chiu, S.Y., New project system for undergraduate electronic engineering (2005) European Journal of Engineering Education, 30 (3), pp. 385-392. , DOI 10.1080/03043790500114607; See, A., Challenging computer-based projects for a mechatronics course: Teaching and learning through projects employing virtual instrumentation (2006) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 14, pp. 222-242; Smolinski, P., Hake, R., Onipede, D., Miller, M.C., Computational and Experimental Dynamics Project for an Integrated Engineering Curriculum (2001) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 9 (1), pp. 1-7. , DOI 10.1002/cae.1000; Lima, R.M., Carvalho, D., Flores, M.A., Natascha, H.J., A case study on project led education in engineering: Students' and teachers' perceptions (2007) Eur J Eng Educ, 32, pp. 337-347; Lilliesköld, J., Östlund, S., Designing, implementing and maintaining a first year project course in electrical engineering (2008) Eur J Eng Educ, 33, pp. 231-242; Charles, I., Kita, A., Mi, B., Graduate mechatronics course: Final group projects (2003) Proc IEEE/ASME Int Conf Adv Intell Mechatron, pp. 169-174; Radharamanan, R., Jenkins, E., Laboratory learning modules on CAD/CAM and robotics in engineering education (2008) Int J Innovat Comput Inform Control, 4, pp. 433-444; Ume, I.C., Kita, A., Liu, S., Skinner, S., Graduate Mechatronics course in the school of mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech (2002) Mechatronics, 12 (2), pp. 323-335. , DOI 10.1016/S0957-4158(01)00072-1, PII S0957415801000721; Ume, C., Timmerman, M., Innovative communications oriented design projects in mechatronics courses (1995) IEEE Trans Educ, 38, pp. 223-229; De Graaff, E., Kolmos, A., Characteristics of Problem-Based Learning (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (5), pp. 657-662; Heitmann, G., Project study and project organized curricula: A historical review of its intentions, O.

Theoretically, we take a social cultural approach to group creativity and emphasize the influences of a learning environment on student motivation in group creativity development. Empirically, a case study was carried outonastudent satellite projectinthe Department of Electronic Systemat Aalborg Universityin Denmark, by using qualitative methods including interviews and observation. The findings show that student motivation is stimulated in multiple ways in a PBL environment, such as formal and informal group discussions, regular supervisor meetings and sharing leadership. Furthermore, factors such as common goals, support of peers and openness stimulate motivation. However, the students think that a time schedule is a barrier to group creativity. Thus, the supervisors are encouraged to be more aware of the complex relationships between student, teacher and task and the student response. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Group creativity; Motivation; Problem and project-based learning",,"Sheppard, S.D., Macatangay, K., Colby, A., Sullivan, W.M., (2008) Education Engineers, Design for the Future of the Field, , A Wiley, San Francisco; Rugarcia, A., Felder, R.M., Woods, D.R., Stice, J.M., The future of engineering education I, a vision for a new century (2000) Chem.

Typically the curriculum includes only a qualitative discussion of the character of the errors involved and the assumptions made in using the studied approximate formulas or equations. Yet, as an engineer, the graduate student would often have to make decisions that depend on the level of accuracy of these approximations, e.g., a decision on the necessity to perform a costly computational analysis vs. relying on a standard approximate formula. The goal of this paper is to point to the need for in-class discussion on quantitative error estimates, as part of the engineering curriculum. As a case in point, the torsion of elastic rods with thin-walled cross sections is considered. Quantitative error estimates are provided for the standard formulas for the torsional stress and rigidity. A preliminary investigation is performed, involving 3rd-year students at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Technion, at the end of a Structural Analysis course. This preliminary study shows that without having been exposed in class to quantitative error estimates, intuition leads most of the students to making the wrong practical decisions in some situations, which might have a negative impact on their future work as engineers. This study thus points to the educational benefit in teaching the subject of quantitative error estimates for engineering approximations during undergraduate studies. In the case of a 3rd year Structural Analysis course, the material associated with the subject would require about half anhour of frontal teaching, but can also be offered to the studentsas an enrichment inwriting for self-study. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Error estimates; Solid mechanics; Structural mechanics; Torsion",,"Wheeler, A.J., Ganji, A.R., (1996) Introduction to Engineering Experimentation, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J; Ranaldi, F., Vanni, P., Giachetti, E., What students must know about the determination of enzyme kinetic parameters (1999) Biochem.

The development of such generic or key competencies should be integrated throughout curricula, along with specific competencies in the disciplines such as engineering. This is a common educational goal in higher education in the USA and in Europe inside the Bologna Process. To enhance the capability of students to articulate their lifelong learning competencies, we developed a 'Lifelong Learning Competencies for Engineers' program for senior engineering students. This was presented as a workshop in a senior design course at the University of San Diego. The workshop includes presentations on lifelong learning competencies and specific recommendations for engineers, as well as an active learning exercise that helps students demonstrate their lifelong learning competence developed throughout their undergraduate career. Our mixed-methods evaluation reveals that the students improve their awareness of the importance of LLL atan important time in their lives as they finish their undergraduate academic career and move to the global labor market. Since lifelong learning spans disciplinary and national boundaries, this program could be adopted by other engineer educators and adapted by educators from a variety of fields. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Key competencies; Lifelong Learning; Professional development",,"Faure, E., (1972) Learning to Be: The World of Education Today and Tomorrow, , UNESCO, Paris; Delors, J., (1996) Learning: The Treasure from Within, , UNESCO, Paris; Knapper, C., Cropley, A.J., (1985) Lifelong Learning in Higher Education, , Kogan Page, Routledge, London; Annan, K., (2000) U.

Globalization of the traditional university engineering curriculum is necessary to help students prepare to work in a global environment. More research is neededto identify, aggregate, and valid a teacomprehensive set of global competencies. The purpose ofthis research was to identify and validate a comprehensive set of global competencies for engineering students. A review of the literature was first conducted from which numerous global competencies were identified. From this list of competencies, a set of global competencies with an associated conceptual model was developed to group the competencies by contextual topics. Two surveys were then developed and distributed separately to academic and industry professionals to obtain a critique of the importance and comprehensiveness of the global competencies that were identified. From this research a comprehensive set of 23 global competencies was identified and arranged within five broad categories. The 23 competencies were validated by two professional groups who rated each of the competencies based on their importance. Not all of the competencies were considered tohave equal importance, but each was considered to be at least somewhat important; preference was typically placed on dispositional-based global competencies. Academic and industry experts largely confirmed that itwas important for engineering students to develop these global competencies. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Competence; Cross-cultural; Engineering education; Global; Global engineering; Intercultural",,"Grandin, J.M., Preparing engineers for the global workplace Online Journal for Global Engineering Education, 1, p. 2006; Grudzinski-Hall, M.G., Jellison, K.L., Stewart-Gambino, H.W., Weisman, R.N., Engineering students in a global world: Lehigh university's global citizenship Online Journal for Global Engineering Education, 2, p. 2007; Deardorff, D.K., Identification and assessment of intercultural competence as a student outcome of internationalization (2006) Journal of Studies in International Education, 10 (3), pp. 241-266. , DOI 10.1177/1028315306287002; Downey, G.L., Lucena, J.C., Moskal, B.M., Parkhurst, R., Bigley, T., Hays, C., Jesiek, B.K., Nichols-Belo, A., The globally competent engineer: Working effectively with people who define problems differently (2006) Journal of Engineering Education, 95, pp. 107-138; Hunter, B., White, G.P., Godbey, G.C., What does it mean to be globally competent?

The study also showswhich personal competences of students are reinforced most during the FYP process, including the preparation, elaboration, presentation and defence stages. In order to gather information on this subject, a survey was conducted at two different Spanish technical universities - one public and one private - and a comparative analysis was performed of the questionnaires collected. The competence model considered is that used by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), since the official title of the public university has been accredited by this model. The results indicate which personal and professional competences of students are reinforced well by undertaking the FYP. Any significant differences in response by university are explained in the study. For validation purposes, the results were contrasted with the instructor's perspective using the triangulation methodology. Finally, the conclusions drawn will permit the design of new study plans to cope more effectively with the challenges of the FYP in the new Bologna framework. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","ABET competences; Engineering education; Final year project",,"Koskinen, K.U., Pihlanto, P., Vanharanta, H., Tacit knowledge acquisition and sharing in a project work context (2003) International Journal of Project Management, 21 (4), pp. 281-290. , DOI 10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00030-3; Ortiz-Marcos, I., Evolution of final year projects at the universidad politécnica de Madrid (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, Ed., 26 (1), pp. 162-168; Bartkus, K.R., Skills and cooperative education: A conceptual framework (2001) Journal of Cooperative Education, 36, pp. 17-24; Berggren, C., Söderlund, J., Rethinking project management education: Social twists and knowledge co-production (2008) International Journal of Project Management, 26, pp. 286-296; Jawitz, J., Shay, S., Moore, R., Management and assessment of final year projects in engineering (2002) International Journal of Engineering Education, 18 (4), pp. 472-478; Patrick, S., Chua, K., The initiation, organisation and logistics of part-time final-year projects (2001) International Journal of Engineering Education, 17 (3), pp. 248-254; Ortiz-Marcos, I., Sánchez Alejo, F.J., (2005) El Proyecto Fin de Carrera, , Normas de realización, presentación y defensa.

This paper reports on research that focused on the language that the children used when they were involved in a design and technology activity. In accessing the results of the language study, the findings suggest that the children's motivation was high and played a significant role in children's task engagement and persistence. Analysis revealed that there were several key ideas that the children focused on, namely: the fun experienced by participating in the activity, the difficulty of doing the task, the satisfaction of completing the task, the importance of social interaction and the frustrations surrounding aspects of the task. These affective factors that are related directly to motivation will be demonstrated through the children's language responses to their participation in design and technology education. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Affective factors; Creativity; Language; Learning; Motivation","Affective factors; Creativity; Design and technology; Language; Language study; Learning; Social interactions; Technology education; Design; Innovation; Motivation; Technology; Engineering education","Andreasen, N.C., (2006) The Creative Brain.

Apart from instilling important problem-solving skills, such pedagogical frameworks address the critical social skill aspects of engineering education due to their team-based, project-based nature. However, it is required of the twenty-first century engineer to be not only technically competent and socially and culturally aware, but also innovative and entrepreneurial. This paper discusses a reformulated first-year engineering course at the University of Pretoria, which was adopted 6 years ago to better address the required innovation skills of engineering students. This design-build-innovate course employs a unique creative problem-solving strategy in designing and building solutions to set technological problems. The students further investigate the provisional patenting of their design concepts. Mini business plans are developed and the students participate in a university- and in a national innovation competition. This introductory engineering course has been successful as measured by overwhelmingly positive student feedback, several provisional patents, and a number of small start-up companies that emanated from the students' work. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Design-build; Herrmann brain dominance instrument; Innovation skills; Introductory engineering course","Business plans; Creative problem-solving; Design build; Design concept; First-year engineering; Introductory engineering course; Modern engineering; National innovations; Problem solving skills; Project-based; Social skills; Start-up companies; Student feedback; Competition; Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Innovation; Model buildings; Patents and inventions; Problem solving; Teaching; Technical presentations; Students","(2005) Innovate America: Thriving in A World of Challenge and Change.

Studies have shown these students are at a critical age where exposure to engineering and other related fields such as science, mathematics, and technology greatly impact their career goals. A variety of advanced learning technologies have emerged to enhance learning, promote hands-on experiences, and increase interest in engineering. However, creating and sustaining technology-infused learning environments at the precollege level is a challenging task, as many schools have limited resources and expertise. Moreover, while numerous technology solutions are available to support ambitious engineering-learning goals, choosing the right technology to align to program goals and resources may be a daunting task. In this work, we fill the gap between the applicability of educational implements and suitable teaching methods for precollege engineering. We present an overview of available hardware-and software-based technologies, and characterize these technologies based on criteria such as median price, the type of learning activities fostered, and the required users' expertise levels. In addition, we outline how these technologies align with deductive and inductive teaching methods that emphasize direct-instruction, inquiry-, problem-, and project-based methods, as studies have shown these methods are effective for precollege engineering education. © 2012, IEEE","Educational technologies; engineering education; human-centered computing; interactive environments; learning technologies; robotics",,"(2010) 4M Industrial Development Limited, Green Science Series, , http://www.4m-ind.com; (2011) Aldebaran Robotics, NAO, , http://www.aldebaran-robotics.com; (2007) America COMPETES Act, H.

Simultaneously, the skills required for working in research and development changed as well; handling of computer software, knowledge of mathematical or numerical algorithms and programming skills play an increasingly important role in the daily job routine of the working engineer. To support learning by practical exercises, engineering faculties, the faculties of mathematics and physics, and the Computing Center of the University of Stuttgart setup a project for implementing an online programming lab for teaching the required skills. The focus of this project is to provide easy access to the necessary software tools, avoid the overhead of installation and maintenance, and seamlessly integrate these tools into the eLearning infrastructure of the university. This paper describes the motivation and backgrounds, the software infrastructure and early results of this project.","Matlab; Online courses; Programming; Simulation; Virtual laboratory","Algorithms; Computer programming; Computer software; Curricula; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Engineers; Mathematical programming; Social networking (online); Teaching; German university system; Numerical algorithms; On-line programming; Online course; Research and development; Simulation; Software infrastructure; Virtual laboratories; MATLAB","Chassapis, C., Esche, S., Aziz, E.-S., An architecture for virtual laboratory experimentation (2006) Proc. of Annual Conf. of ASEE 2006, , Chicago; Xu, S., Esche, S., Chassapis, C., Jia, R., Aziz, E.-S., Gao, S., A virtual laboratory on fluid mechanics (2006) Proc. of Anual Conf. of ASEE, , Chicago; Jeschke, S., Richter, Th., Scheel, H., Thomsen, Ch., On remote and virtual experiments in elearning in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics (2007) J. of Software (JSW), 2 (6), pp. 76-85; Jeschke, S., Richter, Th., Seiler, R., VideoEasel: Architecture of virtual laboratories on mathematics and natural sciences (2005) Proc. of 3rd Intl.

A genuine ""single market"" for innovation is needed in Europe. By 2030 an open, fair market for innovation will pull new ideas, talent and investment from around the world. An open, ERA-wide network, online, will provide a simple clearing house to promote ideas and find technologies across borders; networking and visualisation tools will make collaboration easier and cheaper. Short - and medium-term scenariosand their implementation by University of Miskolc (UM) are presented below: (i) The scenarios integrate · e-university teaching mission implementation by software introduced to orient both academics and students on curriculum, exams, evaluation, time schedule and all other events; · more than 100 engineering textbooks have been prepared and digitised with the provision of easy access, · web-site of the university and departments have been designed, gradually renewed and effective at www.uni-miskolc.hu · contracts have been signed with the city of Miskolc, 160 industry/company/organisations like Chamber of Commerce and Industry, etc. to pave the way for joint co-operation and development, · researchers' nights are organised each year in September since 2005 under the umbrella of ""Research in Europe"" framework, · establish vital contact with (upper) secondary schools to recruite new entrants to engineering, · exhibitions are organised both for multinational firms and small and medium-sized enterprises to present their products, services and processes and also to take chance to recruit new graduates, offer stipend to students, etc., · academics and students are encouraged to apply for EC grants and various schemes. (ii) In the science and research fields · four engineering PhD schools are running also with the objective to generate new knowledge, UM runs four PhD schools in engineering in 3-year-duration as ""I. Sályi"" Mechanical Engineering PhD School, ""J. Hatvany"" Information Technology PhD School with the fields of electrical and electronic engineering inclusive, ""S. Mikoviny"" Earth Science and Technology PhD School and ""A. Kerpely"" Material Science and Technology PhD School. · Joint industry projects are running also for knowledge creation and dissemination, · knowledge transfer is carrying out by international microCAD Conference annually, by Students Scientific Forum (TDK in Hungarian) and participation, lecturing and publications at international conferences and professional periodicals. (iii) Four centres of excellence are working in engineering to achieve the desired attractive institution status; they are Centre of Excellence on · Sustainable Natural Resources Management, · Applied Material Science and Nano-technology, · Mechatronics and Logistics, and · Innovative Mechanical Engineering Design and Technology. For the young researchers - PhD candidates and MSc students - with the provision of scientific leaders of high calibre and research infrastructure the project puts direct impact on the scientific quality of respective PhD Schools, the provision of talented students and the new generation of researchers. University management is in difficult position since Euro 10 million was extracted from the budget within the latest 18 months. If the university is underfinanced, competition will be lost. Hungary is exposed to brain drain at a high degree. One study ranks Hungary 52nd.

In engineering lectures, these constraints represent serious limitations. In order to overcome them, digital slides have been traditionally used. More recently, digital displays and tablets have been used to further improve the learning process. Interactive Pen Displays (from Wacom manufacturer) are display devices with some particularities over Tablet PC's that naturally overcome most of these constraints. First, existing software provides endless display possibilities (geometric drawings, colors, simulations, graphs⋯). Also, not only the lecture results can be accurately recorded, but also the whole lecture process in its temporal dimension. This frees students from the tedious task of recording and taking notes and provides richer resources for their posterior autonomous work, as well as allowing recordings to be uploaded as learning objects to collaborative learning environments such as Blackboard or Moodle, for instance. In this paper, the learning experience results from the application of the Interactive Pen Displays in Engineering-related lectures are presented. Specifically, results are provided for the topics of Advanced Compilers Theoryin Informatics Engineering, Introduction to Control Systemsin Electrical Engineering, and Industrial Control Systemsin Electrical Engineering, Informatics Engineering, and Chemical Engineering. For the sake of generality, several professors and students in different courses have used the tool. We present the used methodology in the lectures, the results of questionnaires from the students and professors who participated in the study as well as the results from the publication of the session scripts and recordings in the learning platform. Results showed that 84% of students stated that the graphical possibilities of the device made the lesson easier, and 92% reported a positive assessment as complement for the learning process. The use, benefits and limitations of alternative devices such as classic Tablet PCs are also discussed and compared to the Interactive Pen Displays. Finally, conclusions and further research lines related to the use of the tool are presented.","Engineering education; ICT in education; Interactive pen displays; Poll analysis; Tablet PC","Computer aided instruction; Display devices; Distributed computer systems; Education; Information science; Learning systems; Microcomputers; Personal computers; Students; Surveys; Collaborative learning environment; Engineering lecture; Industrial controls; Interactive pen display; Learning experiences; Learning in engineering; Poll analysis; Tablet PCs; Engineering education","Stickel, M., Impact of lecturing with the tablet PC on students of different learning styles (2009) Proc. of the 39th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 1-6. , Editors, San Antonio, TX; Brusilovsky, P., Tree, K., A distributed architecture for adaptive e-learning (2004) WWW Conference, , MAY 17-22, New York USA; Henze, N., Nejdl, W., A logical characterizing of adaptive education hypermedia (2004) Journal of New Review in Hypermedia and Multimedia, 10 (1), p. 77; Jeschke, S., Knipping, L., Natho, N., Schröder, C., Zorn, E., Information management in education using Tablet PCs and OneNote (2009) SEFI 2009 Annual Conference; Li, S.C., Pow, J.W.C., Wong, E.M.L., Fung, A.C.W., Empowering student learning through Tablet PCs: A case study Education and Information Technologies, 15 (3), pp. 171-180; Casas, I., Ochoa, S.F., Puente, J., Using tablet PCs and pen-based technologies to support engineering education (2009) Human-computer Interaction.

We focus on their professional socialization process in French Engineering Schools. We study, from the perspective of the educational and then ethical issues, a ""marginal"" practice which is, however, becoming increasingly common. It is about the interruption of the curriculum for a period ranging between a few months and a whole year, generally called ""gap period"". A more precise definition of this educational device would be: an institutionalized extra-curricular period. This kind of device, at the moment lacking in any real institutional regulation at a national level, is not without raising some practical, but also fundamental questions. Borrowed from Business and Management French Schools, the ""gap periods"" are offered to Engineering students by an increasing number of Engineering Schools, and they meet a tremendous success among the students. But their pedagogical goals are rather unclear, and even divergent: some Schools insist on their educational goal, using words as emancipation, maturity, personal development, social and cultural openness, while other Schools will insist on the professional side: pre-professionalization, adaptation to the business world, broadening of the skills base, increased employability, etc. First, we describe the general frame of our research: this will help the readers to give some depth of field to this study. Then, we present this new raising phenomenon in a broad approach, trying to explain what it consists of, and the different ways of evaluating it, since its appreciation appears to be rather contrasted, and even quite critical. The analysis of two exemplary cases will enable the reader to seize the great variety of practices grouped under the same heading, and to understand that the underlying pedagogical and even ethical choices, as well as the conceptions of an engineer's role in our society, might be quite opposite. We conclude with some paths for a further and deeper problematization, in a period where the necessity of a reflexive analysis on what kind of engineers our world is in need of appears to be of great urgency.","Engineering education; Engineering ethics; France; Gap period; Gap year","Education; Engineers; Philosophical aspects; Social sciences; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Business and management; Engineering curriculum; Engineering ethics; Engineering schools; France; Gap period; Gap year; Personal development; Engineering education","Didier, C., (2008) Les Ingénieurs et l'Éthique, , Hermès, Paris; Talin, K., Didier, C., Les ingénieurs et l'éthique, 22ème enquête socio-économique des Ingénieurs et Scientifiques de France (2011) Ingénieurs et Scientifiques de France, pp. 73-79. , Darsch, Ch, Longuet, L eds, Paris; Ingénieur, un diplôme qui ouvre des portes, (2012) L'Etudiant, , http://www.letudiant.fr/jobsstages/les-secteurs-qui-recrutent/futurs-ingenieurs-quelssont-les-secteurs-les-plus-porteurs-pour-vous-13355.html, May, accessed on June 1st, 2012; Simonnin, P., Didier, C., Why, and how, do they choose to become engineers?

Compared to America, the cultural approach of entrepreneurship is quite different in our countries: in USA, the intention of creating an enterprise is very present in young people's head during their studies and they do not fear failure, which is not the case in Europe. So it is necessary to encourage and to accompany young people towards creation. It is the reason why efforts are made for the creation of new curricula, even at secondary school level. It is a fact that the number of enterprises created by Masters and Doctors in Engineering is not very important in France with respect to the number of graduates in these fields. With all the actors of Region Centre we decided to build a one year course inside the engineering school, where people having ""an idea"" could learn how to lead it towards a new enterprise. This paper presents the genesis and the content of this course with its specificities linked to sustainable development (societal responsibility, eco design) and the demarche to create a consortium of private and public institutions around this curriculum. 1 CONTEXT 1.1 Europe and France in front of Entrepreneurship Innovative entrepreneurship is a rare species in Europe: teachers, students and graduates of European higher education institutions seldom see the opportunity to translate their knowledge and education into innovative products and services. As a driver and key element in combining the different areas of the Knowledge Triangle, Entrepreneurship is at the very heart of the EIT vision and activities. In France, in 2009, the government decided to initiate the ""Plan Entrepreneuriat Etudiant"" so as to develop entrepreneurship inside higher education establishments. Both ministries of industry and education are in charge of this device. 1.2 Context of the design of this curriculum in our Region and partners involved The initiatives of IET do not concern so much people but the concept developed can be transposed in the countries and regions. In the field of entrepreneurship: Universities cannot work alone; at the same time, for many years, socioeconomic organisms try, each at one's level, to develop entrepreneurship. Even if we know that knowledge is built in the mind of our young graduates, it is necessary to have the support of experience of all of them. The course was constructed around academic partners: a school of engineering(Master Degree) part of a multidisciplinary University, a school of management part of the same University, a school of design existing in the same city as the University and professional partners: 2 organisms including business incubators and transfer of technology, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chamber of Experts Accountants, a cluster for innovation and service, banks, Institute for Industrial property, Associations of small and large enterprises, local authorities. 2 DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRICULUM The course includes the acquisition of knowledge necessary to build an innovative enterprise, skills concerning management of an enterprise, personal development specific knowledge, elements concerning eco-design, innovation by services and creative design, but also the tutoring of the project from the emerging step to the real creation. Each student will have a tutor which is an actor of economic life working in the same area. The aim is to develop also the competences linked to the process of creating an enterprise, and not only the competences of management of an enterprise. As the course has the aim to give the student not only a toolbox for creating an enterprise but also the concrete elements to do so as soon as the course ends, the professional thesis based on the project of creation will develop the maturation of the project all along this one year course. All along the project reviews of project will take place. Four of them should be integrated in the course. The selection of student admitted in the course evaluating ad equation of the personality of the candidates with spirit of entrepreneurship will be realised with help of professionals too.","Engineers; Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Sustainable development","Design; Ecodesign; Education; Engineering; Engineering education; Innovation; Planning; Societies and institutions; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Business incubators; Engineering schools; Entrepreneurship; Higher education institutions; Innovative enterprise; Personal development; School of engineering; Transfer of technology; Curricula","http://eit.europa.eu, KIC entrepreneurship activities: The EIT and entrepreneurship and Doctoral School; (2012) Engineering Education and the Bologna Process, A Joint Communication of SEFI and BEST, , www.sefi.be, April; http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid5757/la-formation-et-lasensibilisation-a-l-entrepreneuriat.html; Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et Recherche, (2011) Référentiel de Compétences: Entrepreneuriat et Esprit d'Entreprendre, pp. 1-20. , 2009; Wikipedia.org:mini-entreprise; (2008) Cercle d'Outre Manche, du Brain Drain au Brain Gain, le Triangle d'Or Université Recherche Entreprise: Ou Comment le Royaume-Uni Fait de l'Université et de la Recherche des Acteurs Clefs dans la Création d'Entreprise, pp. 1-53. , Juin; Frugier, D., Verzat, C., Bachelet, R., Hannachi, A., Developing an enterprising spirit among engineering college students: What are the educational factors?

The research performed was an institutional wide study, which looked at the staff barriers, opportunities and relevance of engineering and technology education. The idea of research into engineering and technology education arose from the work by Ernest Boyer through a publication named ""Scholarship Reconsidered"" referring to the scholarship of teaching and learning [1]. Boyer's goal was to bring research, scholarship and teaching together through a redefinition of four forms of scholarship: the scholarship of discovery, application or the scholarship of engagement, the scholarship of integration, and the scholarship of teaching. The definition and concept of the scholarship of teaching and learning has been actively pursued for some time now. Kathleen McKinney in her address to the Illinois State University mentions about the challenges faced in tertiary education research [2]. These challenges include the lack of support from the institutions, lack of recognition, value and reward for research into learning and teaching, insufficient training and development, hostility towards staff performing education research, and the isolation of staff involved in tertiary research from the staff conducting traditional discipline research. The lack of recognition for research in learning and teaching at the same level as discipline research has been cited by many researchers in this field [3-6]. Academic staff also face barriers like lack of time to engage in engineering and technology education research due to commitments in teaching and discipline research. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative results from a university wide research study, which investigated the barriers staff face at Swinburne University of Technology towards developing and performing research in engineering and technology education. The findings from this research illustrate how faculty staff view research in engineering and technology education. The views about how faculty staff perceive research in engineering and technical education are also presented along with the views of the faculty management. The paper also presents the areas in which academic staff require support in growing engineering and technology education research. Figure 1 shows the barriers for staff in performing research in engineering and technology education. Time, workload and lack of financial support have featured as the prominent barriers to the research in learning and teaching. The non-recognition of research in learning and teaching at par with discipline based or fundamental research also figures as a big impediment to research in learning and teaching. There was overwhelming consensus that a community of practice based model will be an effective approach in enhancing the quality of research into learning and teaching. A workload model which will accommodate a time for research in engineering education is needed and seed funding for the projects is also needed.","Engineering education","Education; Engineering education; Human resource management; Personnel training; Teaching; Community of practice; Engineering and technology; Engineering and technology education research; Illinois state universities; Learning and teachings; Scholarship of teaching and learning; Swinburne University of Technology; Training and development; Engineering research","Boyer, E., (1990) Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; McKinney, K., Attitudinal and structural challenges contributing to challenges in the work of the scholarship of teaching and learning (2006) New Directions for Institutional Research, 129, pp. 37-50; McKinney, K., (2002) The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning: Current Challenges and Future Visions, , Ceremony to Install the Cross Chair in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Illinois State University; Richlin, L., Scholarly teaching and the scholarship of teaching (2001) Revisiting Scholarship: Identifying and Implementing the Scholarship of Teaching, New Directions for Teaching and Learning, (86). , Kreber, C. ed., San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Kreber, C., Cranton, P.A., Exploring the scholarship of teaching (2000) Journal of Higher Education, 71, pp. 476-496; Wankat, P.C., Felder, R.M., Smith, K.A., Oreovicz, F.S., The scholarship of teaching and learning engineering (2002) Disciplinary Syles in the Scholarship Off Teaching and Learning: Exploring the Common Ground, Chapter 11.

The students' level of interest and perceived competencies in Structural Engineering courses were measured by adapting the Perception of Engineering Classes Survey (PECS) Questionnaire (Molina, 2011). Some interesting insight of the study are: 1). Students are more likely to collaborate, challenge their teachers, use modeling in learning Structural Engineering, and perceive what they learn in the class as matching their learning at home; 2). Students have a generally low level of interest and perceived competencies in Structural Engineering courses; 3). There is a significant relationship between collaboration and congruence factors and perceived competencies in Structural Engineering courses.","Cultural Learning; Engineering education; Environment; Structural Engineering","Computer aided instruction; Education; Professional aspects; Structural design; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Technical presentations; Civil engineering students; Classroom learning; Cultural environment; Cultural learning; Environment; Learning environments; Level Of Interest; Student competencies; Engineering education","Ackerman, P., Individual differences in skill learning: An integration of psychometric and information processing perspectives (2009) Psychology Bulletin, (102), pp. 3-27; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Fisher, D., Waldrip, B., Assessing culturally sensitive factors in the learning environment of science classroom Research in Science Education, 27, pp. 41-49; Enriquez, G., (1994) Culture's Consequences, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publication; Menchor, Weise, (1974) Classroom Environments, 2, pp. 120-128. , London: Croom Helm L; Kramer, A., (2011) Interest, Learning and Development, , Hillsdale, NJ.: Erlbaum; Dovan, K., Reliability in content analysis: Some common misconceptions and recommendations (1998) Human Communication Research, 30 (3), pp. 411-433; Manalasal, D.A., (1985) Physics Achievement of Muslim and Christian Students in North Cotobato, , Master's Thesis, Dela Salle University, Manila","Ucol-Ganiron, T.; Qassim UniversitySaudi Arabia",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

In this way, eight European and eight South American Institutions are working hand in hand at solving the problem. We want to answer the questions: Why? What? How? Why? The final purpose must be greatly enhancing the employability of Joint graduates in Latin America. This means that the curricula offered them in Europe must respond to the needs of the South American job market, which implies a systematic study of such needs. What? The instruments we analyze are the Joint Degrees at the graduate level. How? We put in place a virtuous loop whereby the feedback from various constituencies on the existing programs are compared with the emerging needs of the job market in order to create a benchmark. The project ADDE Salem involves partner Institutions that have a long record of successful cooperation in Joint Degrees and a consistent pool of South American double graduates. Moreover, all the Institutions have very strong links with the industrial sector. We consider the non academic partners as the best source of information related to employability in South America. The innovations promoted by our projects in the curricula of those Joint Degrees targeted to the South American students, is a guarantee for the South American Institutions that sending their best students to Europe in the framework of Joint Degree programs will enhance their employability at home. The project ADDE Salem involves partner Institutions that have a long record of successful cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic. Double degrees between the European partners and the South American ones have been signed and implemented for many years. European Institutions are Politecnico di Milano, Ecole Centrale de Lille, Ecole Centrale Nantes, Ecole Central Paris, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Instituto Superior Tecnico de Lisboa (IST), Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM) and Lund University. Latin American Institutions are Instituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires (ITBA), Universidad Austral, The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Universidad de Sao Paulo, Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC), Uni-versidad del Norte and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. The methodology of the project consist of 7 phases, that includes design questionnaires for four different constituencies, data gathering and their analysis in different groups according to the model. We have had two meetings in the project, the kick-off meeting in Milano and the second in Sao Paulo. In the Kick-off Consortium meeting in Milano, October 2011, we receive 16 participants from South America and 16 participants from Europe, this was the opportunity to confirm the methodology and working groups and their leaders. In the second meeting in Sao Paulo, we receive all member of the consortium and we had two panels with representatives of industry and with professional who were in double degree program Brazil-Europe. Their participation help to define many aspect in order to finish the phase 2 of the project and prepare the questionnaires. It's important to mention that part of the information comes from different projects that are involved in Education and Engineering Education in the World.

Each year over 400 students enter the Bachelor's program, which is common for all engineering disciplines. Amongst them, there are only about 14% female students. In the beginning of the academic years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, all 800 first year engineering students filled out a written questionnaire. In the first part of the survey the students indicate their background: the level of their prior mathematical education and overall score (percentage) in high school. After all, high school GPA is found to be a significant predictor to engineering student success. The study motivation of the entering students, as it is another predictor for academic success, is measured by a series of Likert-type statements [1]. Furthermore, at the end of the first and second semester, after the exams, study time measurements were performed. The female students do not differ from the male students in the level of their prior mathematical education. However, significant differences are noticed in the overall percentage in high school, their motivation profiles, their self-esteem and their total study time. The overall high school score of the starting female students is significantly higher compared to the male starting students. The motivation profile of the female students is in general of a much better quality [2]. Furthermore, at the start of the academic year, significantly more male students (60%) are certain, they will pass their exams with good results compared to the female students (only 40%). From study time measurements it was concluded that the average female student spends more time (about 8h) on studying each specific course of the first year compared to the average male student. Due to all aforementioned observations, it is expected that the average female student would be the significant better performer in her first year at university. But it was observed, that the group of female students did not scored better in their first year. For the more general courses like Calculus, General Physics and Philosophy the female students score indeed significantly better; on the other hand, for more typical engineering courses such as Applied Mechanics, Technical Chemistry and Informatics, the male students score better. Probably an effort could be made to come up with more society-related technological examples to motivate the female students for these courses [3, 4].","Background; First year; Gender; Motivation","Calculations; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Motivation; Surveys; Time measurement; Background; Engineering course; Engineering curriculum; Engineering disciplines; First year; First-year engineering; Gender; Mathematical educations; Students","Heylen, C., Smet, M., Buelens, H., Vander Sloten, J., Problem solving and engineering design, introducing bachelor students to engineering practice at K.

Access to information and education plays a key role in students' development opportunities all across the world. The global access to the internet stimulates more and more virtual mobility, creating even more opportunities for students today. BEST (Board of European Students of Technology) in cooperation with EuroPACE, through the Thematic Network of EU-VIP (Enterprise University Virtual Placement) strived to improve and empower virtual mobility especially. The purpose of this cooperation was to make the students' perspectives wider, improve existing virtual programs and develop a set of guidelines for the future. BEST organised two symposiums on education (2010 in Ljubljana and 2011 in Riga) in order to assess students' expectations on virtual internships and to evaluate pilot projects from student perspective. Pilot projects were carried out by other partners of EU-VIP in order to create a connection between students, companies and higher education institutions (HEIs). The purpose was to identify the benefits that could be developed through the virtual internship and possible pitfalls that may be faced. Within these pilot projects differences were defined in the virtual level of the internship: from blended to fully virtual. During each symposium, 22 international-minded participants discussed virtual mobility and its future. The role of BEST is to endeavor the sharing of students and get their perception on such online programs; these being also the conclusions of the symposium. The main aim was to define from the students' perspective the needs within a virtual internship and to analyse whether students can reach same benefits as in a regular working place, when being physically at the office. In order to stimulate participants' ideas and have as many useful outcomes as possible, several methods were used for the pilot projects' evaluation; from the regular discussion groups to the SWOT analysis or the more innovative exhibition walk. As a result of the 2 symposiums, the most suitable structure of virtual internship is a setting which contains students from different countries working together in small groups. Tasks should be clearly defined and multiple online communication tools should be used to communicate during the working process. For example: A company can organise a virtual office for the interns, thereby they are socially connected, working in their virtual department, using a forum as a communication tool. Preferably, the people involved in such an internship should be students from different countries, supported by an academic mentor from their home university and by a contact person from the company or organisation offering the virtual internship. To understand national differences between countries, there are ""Hofstende dimensions"" taken into the consideration. Related to trends in today's business world, there is a need for international involved people able to do more complex work than ever before. Participants of both symposiums realised that, in the future there will be more opportunities and possibilities for online work, which have an added value. It provides experiences similar to real work, which is required by companies and at the same time it is beneficial for students as a working experience.","Online life; Student input; Students' mobility; Virtual placements","Complex networks; Education; Engineering education; Mobile computing; Social networking (online); Communication tools; Discussion Groups; Higher education institutions (HEIs); On-line communication; Online life; Student perspectives; Students' perspectives; Virtual placements; Students","(2011) Is Your Life Online?

In a Project Based Learning (PBL) curriculum these students are expected to work in intercultural settings. In the projects, collaboration and communication among students are a major factor influencing their learning experiences. In the context of engineering education this experience is an important contribution in the preparation of professional practices. The objective of this paper is to explore the influence of cultural differences on collaboration and communication by investigating the experiences of engineering students during their learning process in intercultural student groups. We are living in a changing world where events and innovations in engineering along with expectations of stakeholders involved have resulted in the globalisation of engineering. There is broad recognition that engineering education needs to change in order to meet the challenges of the globalised society [1]. Globalisation is creating a context in which engineers from one culture need to collaborate and communicate efficiently with professional from other cultures. In this changing context of the engineering profession, it is important to see what the cultural issues are and how one culture is different from others? It has long been argued that cognitive processes, just like the beliefs and values held by an individual depends on the social, political and the economic environment in which he socialized [3]. According to Hofstede behaviour, attitude, values, norms of individual are rooted deeply in the culture, from which they originate [2]. Hofstede argues that interactions and communication between student-teacher and student-student are deeply rooted in their belonging culture. It could be problematic during the learning process in such settings. The changing context of engineering has put pressure on the universities to prepare engineers for the drastically different workplace of the future. This paper argues that PBL provides just such an environment. PBL is an educational approach to organize the learning process where students are actively engaged in finding the ways by themselves. In a PBL context students majorly work in collaborative groups. The success of PBL is illustrated by the fact that PBL is practiced in different ways in different parts of the world with different names. In PBL settings, the essential components of the collaborative learning are social interactions and collaboration among the group members, where the peers interact with each other in a learning community. However, the major challenge in an intercultural student group is that the member 's behaviour on interaction and collaboration is based on the cultural background [2]. So collaboration and communication are particularly important for a student in a collaborative learning experience, cultural differences could pose a challenge and impact in the collaborative learning process. The faculty of Engineering and Science at Aalborg University Denmark is selected as a site for this research due to the presence of an intercultural environment in PBL context. Nine intercultural student groups were observed three times (each time three hours) during their group work activities. Further, twenty in-depth interviews were conducted for this study Findings and Conclusions: 1) Language: Contribution to group discussion and collaboration was a big problem for some student. They tend to remain quite most of the time, which is frustrating for others. Efforts to involve all students in the discussion take a lot of time. 2) Time management: Some students due to their previous experience don't want to spend all the time in the group room. Deadlines are often violated, that create a rift among group member. 3) Preconceptions of autochthonous students about the lack of interest by international student in group work. 4) Agreement on group rules: the rules are broken many times, which create disbelieve among group members.","Cultural differences; Learning experiences; Project work","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Economic and social effects; Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Professional aspects; Teaching; Collaborative learning; Collaborative learning process; Cultural difference; Engineering profession; International students; Learning experiences; Professional practices; Project work; Students","National Academy of Engineering, (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academies Press; Felder, R.M., Understanding student differences (2006) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 57-72; Wulf, W., Changing nature of engineering (1997) Bridge, 27 (2). , http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/TheChangingNatureofEngineering/ChangingNatureofEngineering.aspx, accessed 19 June 2012; Parkinson, A., The rationale for developing global competence (2009) Online Journal of Global Engineering Education, 4 (2), pp. 1-15; Hofstede, G., (2001) Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviors, Institutions, and Organizations Across Nations, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Nisbett, R., (2007) The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently and Why, , Nicholas Bradley Publishing: London; Hofstede, G., Cultural differences in teaching and learning (1986) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 10, pp. 301-319; De Graaff, E., Kolmos, A., (2007) Management of Change; Implementation of Problem-based and Project-based Learning in Engineering, , Rotterdam/Taipei: Sense Publishers; Kolmos, A., Fink, F.K., Krogh, L., (2004) The Aalborg Model: Problem Based Project Organized Learning, , first edition, The Aalborg University Press; De Graaff, E., Kolmos, A., Characteristics of problem-based learning (2003) International Journal of Engineering Education, 19 (5), pp. 657-662; Hmelo-Silver, C.E., Problem-based learning: What and how do students learn?

However, it is no longer taken for granted that the engineer will automatically develop both technological knowledge and intercultural and linguistic skills through this international experience. The ideal of transforming students' international experience into ""international connectivity, social cohesion and intercultural learning"" has not generally been achieved (De Vita 2005). Many international studies show numerous barriers to the positive experience of study abroad, such as financial, linguistic or academic difficulties, high stress levels, problems of cross-cultural adaptation and social isolation. (Murphy-Lejeune 2003; Coleman 2007; Dunne 2009; Kinginger 2009; O'Reilly et al. 2010). Many studies have also shown the pertinence of international experience and intercultural competence for practicing engineers (Ravesteijn et al. 2006). However, the success of international assignments can vary according to multiple factors at an individual, organisational and national level (Meier 2004; Browaeys & Price 2008). Individual differences include educational, generational and personality differences and differing levels of intercultural and communication skills (Thomas & Inkson 2003; Trompenaars & Voerman 2009). As researchers in Intercultural Management and Communication, our main concern is the transformation of this practical experience into intercultural skills, attitudes and knowledge Byram 1997; Demorgon 2010; Gourvès-Hayward & Morace 2010). Our previous research has shown that, without the necessary conceptual tools, both student and practicing engineers will gain more effective intercultural learning if faced with challenges and constraints. However, as we have seen, international experience may also end in disaster if the barriers and challenges are too demanding. In this paper, we present the results of in-depth semi-structured interviews with 31 French engineers working as international trainers and 11 Francophone engineering students, following study abroad programmes in the UK and Ireland. Our first focus will be on how these engineers and future engineers narrate, interpret and give meaning to their experience and how this corresponds, or not, to our stance as researchers in Intercultural Management and Communication. Our final aim is to integrate the results of this dialogue between student engineers, engineers and researchers into our emerging intercultural learning model, in order to include the specificities and demands of the engineering profession.","Dialogic research; Intercultural learning; International mobility; Risks","Computational linguistics; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineers; Linguistics; Risks; Students; Cross-cultural adaptation; Intercultural learning; Intercultural managements; International assignments; International connectivity; International experiences; International mobilities; Semi structured interviews; Professional aspects","ENSTA Bretagne, (2010) Règlement de Scolarité Applicable au Cycle ENSI de Formation d'Ingénieurs, pp. 6-20. , Brest; TELECOM Bretagne, (2011) Définir les Compétences d'Un Ingénieur Télécom Bretagne.

Indeed, contemporary social problems requiring engineering solutions are not only a consequence of natural and 'manmade' disasters (such as the Japanese earthquake or the oil leakage in the Gulf of Mexico) but also encapsulate 21st Century dilemmas around sustainability, poverty and pollution [2,6,7]. Given the complexity of such problems and the constant need for innovation, the demand for engineering education to provide a ready supply of suitably qualified engineering graduates, able to make innovative decisions has never been higher [3,5]. Bearing this in mind, and taking account problems of attrition in engineering education [1,6,4] innovation in the way in which the curriculum is developed and delivered is crucial. CDIO [Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate] provides a potentially ground-breaking solution to such dilemmas. Aimed at equipping students with practical engineering skills supported by the necessary theoretical background, CDIO could potentially change the way engineering is perceived and experienced within higher education. Aston University introduced CDIO into its Mechanical Engineering and Design programmes in October 2011. From its induction, engineering education researchers have 'shadowed' the staff responsible for developing and teaching the programme. Utilising an Action Research Design, and adopting a mixed methodological research design, the researchers have worked closely with the teaching team to critically reflect on the processes involved in introducing CDIO into the curriculum. Concurrently, research has been conducted to capture students' perspectives of CDIO. In evaluating the introduction of CDIO at Aston, the researchers have developed a distinctive research strategy with which to evaluate CDIO. It is the emergent findings from this research that form the basis of this paper. Although early-on in its development CDIO is making a significant difference to engineering education at the University. The paper draws attention to pedagogical, practical and professional issues - discussing each one in turn and in doing so critically analysing the value of CDIO from academic, student and industrial perspectives. The paper concludes by noting that whilst CDIO represents a forward-thinking approach to engineering education, the need for constant innovation in learning and teaching should not be forgotten. Indeed, engineering education needs to put itself at the forefront of pedagogic practice.

Safety education can be fairly unreal in that it focuses exclusively on safety issues and safety training, which is primarily based on safety rules, and does not lead to the required improvement [2]. Therefore, the authors of this paper propose to supplement safety education with simulations of real world construction situations, which include social aspects such as communication with other project members, tasks not directly related to safety issues, and stress caused by time pressure. However, how do students perceive an increased level of stress caused by the simulation? The study is based on a quasi-experimental post-test design, which compares the perceived stress levels of an experimental group (i.e. a group of students exposed to a simulator with stress), with the perceived stress level of a control group (i.e. a group of students exposed to the same simulator, but without stress). The stress for the experimental group was caused by time-pressure, generated by the count-down of a given time limit and re-occurring on-screen messages which commanded the student to speed up. ANOVA and Regression Analysis revealed that the perceived stress level of students who applied the simulator with stress has been shown to be insignificantly higher than the perceived stress level of students who applied the simulator without stress. Since the stress produced by time pressure was 'intrinsic' in nature (i.e. related to the time limitation of the cognitive process of realizing safety issues and developing adequate responses to it), this result seems to confirm earlier findings [3, 4, 5] in that students perceive the stress's facilitating effect on learning and, therefore, do not perceive it as negatively as one may have expected. Furthermore, the results indicate an interesting phenomenon. The highest correlation between influencing variables and the perceived stress level for both simulator types was for the variable motivation. The motivation of students to score high seems to have a higher influence on perceived stress than the number of attempts it took to derive an acceptable answer, the ease of simulator use, or the perceived necessity to learn new aspects. Looking at the different stressors, which are related to learning and which were found earlier [6], the students' own motivation does not seem to be a much considered stress factor. The negative correlation of the variable ease of use with the perceived stress level for the students who applied the simulator with stress was to be expected: The easier the application of the simulator, the less stress it will cause. The result of the Regression Analysis seems to indicate that the ease of useis the strongest predictor of all (although negatively correlated), followed by motivation, attemptsand new aspects. The results and findings of this study seem to contribute to simulator based learning of construction safety in different ways. First, this research confirms earlier findings that 'intrinsic' stress does not seem to impair learning. The difference in perceived stress was insignificant between the experimental and the control groups. Secondly, the influence of students' motivation on perceived stress has been shown to be higher for both simulators (with and without stress) than the number of attempts it took to derive an acceptable answer, the ease of simulator use, or the perceived necessity to learn new aspects. Students' motivation as a stressor may have been under-estimated in the past. This study can encourage engineering educators and institutions of engineering education to explore and implement ways to include stress in simulations since it helps to prepare students for real world situations and does not seem to impede their learning by adding an unreasonable level of stress.","Construction safety; Learning; Simulation; Stress","Education; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Motivation; Project management; Regression analysis; Safety engineering; Simulators; Social aspects; Stresses; Construction management; Construction safety; Engineering educators; Experimental groups; Learning; Negative correlation; Real world situations; Simulation; Students","Suckarieh, G., Diamantes, J., Educating construction management students in safety (1995) Safety and Health in Construction, pp. 154-164. , CIB Publication 209, CIB Working Commission 99; Smith, G.R., Arnold, T.M., Safety education expectations for construction engineering and management students (1999) Implementation of Safety and Health on Construction Sites, pp. 265-270. , Singh, Hinze and Coble eds., Smith and Arnold, Rotterdam; Gibb, A.G.F., Haslan, R., Gyi, D.E., Hide, S., Duff, R., What causes accidents?

Many countries in Europe have severe problems trying to overcome this financial crisis. The main remedy applied by governments is to cut back on expenditure, but on the other hand it is said that it is important for a country, and especially for companies, to invest in innovation. These innovations should lead to innovative products that will lead to profitability turnovers for these companies and, as a consequence, improve the economic conditions in a country. Universities provide students with engineering competences, like develop innovation, with which they can show a higher degree of ability to answer complex questions such as how to become players in the market again. Teaching students to become more innovative engineers, Fontys University of Applied Sciences, Department of Engineering, has designed a curriculum in which students are educated in the competence innovation. An important element in the process of teaching innovation to students is the approach of inquiring into possibilities of patents. In the second semester of the first year, students can decide to join an innovative project called: 'The invention project'. The basis of this project is that students are given the opportunity to create their own invention and with their previously acquired knowledge and skills they design, calculate, prototype and present their invention. In a research project, the experiences of students in this Invention Project have been analysed. The goal of this study was to understand what the success factors are for such a project. The basis of this inquiry is a questionnaire to identify the opinions of students. The research was carried out in the spring semester of 2012. In total 31 students were involved in this research. The results show that there was a high degree of student satisfaction about the Invention Project focused on innovation development. Success factors for this project in the first year of the curriculum were seen: 1 to work on own inventions, 2 development of student's perception of the total product creation process and 3 to make students see the relevance of contacts with real professionals from industry and from the patent office in their own project. Improvements can be made by: 1 helping students more during the creativity stage in the project and 2 to coach them more on the aspect of engineering a successful invention of which they can be proud. This Invention project is a interesting with which collaborations with other universities can be set up.","Collaboration; Competences; Innovation; Patents; Product design","Commerce; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Innovation; Investments; Patents and inventions; Product design; Product development; Collaboration; Competences; Department of Engineering; Engineering competences; First-year engineering; Patents; Product creation process; University of applied science; Students","(2012) OECD Economic Surveys Germany 2012: Overview Edition, p. 8; De Jong, J., (2007) Winst Door Innovatie (Translated from the Dutch: Profit by Innovation), pp. 26-27. , Academic Service; Boorsma, E., De Vries, I., (2004) Ask for Tertiary Educated Employees in SME in the Netherlands, , de vraag naar HBO-ers bij MKB-bedrijven, Dijk 12 beleidsonderzoek The Netherlands; (2007) Thematic Review of Tertiary Education, , the Netherlands; Geraedts, H., (2010) Innovative Learning for Innovation; EPO (European Patent Office), (2009) Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office, , http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legaltexts/archive/guidelines-2009.html, status April, 2009; (2005) Oslo Manual: Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Innovation Data: Third Edition, pp. 46-56","Geraedts, H.G.M.; Fontys University of Applied SciencesNetherlands",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

Students spend the first three years in NJUT (Jiangsu, China) being jointly taught by ITTD and NJUT lecturers and complete their 4th year in Ireland in the same class as ITTD students. The increasing number of international students worldwide demonstrates a relatively rapid change in the integration of global education. China adopted its open door policy approximately 25 years ago and sends more students to study abroad than any other country [1]. Chinese students have been shown to have different learning styles than western students [2]. Impressions, opinions and myths about how Chinese students respond to western teaching styles are plentiful, and these are often based on outdated facts. Lecturers delivering modules in NJUT evaluated the student experience in light of the reported cultural differences between Chinese and European students and the potential impact of this on the students' learning and lecturers' teaching styles. NJUT students in 1st, 3rd and final year of the joint programme completed a survey exploring their college experiences. The survey was adapted from the College Student Experience Questionnaire (CSEQ) which is available for use in documenting, understanding and improving the student experience [3]. The survey focused on study practices of the students, development of their ability to learn, integration into college life and satisfaction with course of study. The same survey was completed by 1st, 3rd and final year Irish students. In many ways the findings were the same for the Irish and Chinese students; however there are some significant differences which might be attributed to their family situation and living arrangements, language ability and cultural factors. The findings are compared and contrasted with those of Zhang [4] who conducted a study on students in the three cultures using the Briggs 3P model (Presage, Process, Product). Zhang focuses on the relationships between student characteristics, teaching context, learning approach and achievement. The implications of the findings are compared with those of Cortazzi et al [5] who discusses how Chinese students in the UK change their practices in response to British academic cultures. The difference in the students' assessment of how their learning has progressed is explored in relation to their cultural backgrounds as described by Hofstede's Dimensions of Culture [6]. The paper concludes with a discussion on the ramifications of these findings on course design, delivery and assessment. Many similar traits were found between the Chinese and Irish students. Some differences may be explained by the fact that the Chinese come from very small families who support them financially as they live on campus. The Irish students generally live at home with two thirds being supported by state grants. This impacted on study practices and integration into college life. A high percentage of students said they would choose the same course again. The students' perception of the development of their ability to learn differed for Chinese and Irish students which may be explained by their cultural backgrounds. The findings of this study will be used to further inform the design and delivery of the programme both in NJUT and when the Chinese students arrive in Ireland.","China; Engineering; Ireland; Joint","Curricula; Education; Education computing; Engineering; Engineering education; Joints (structural components); Surveys; Teaching; China; Cultural backgrounds; Cultural difference; International students; Ireland; Living arrangements; Student characteristics; Student experiences; Students","Duan, X.-R., (2003) Chinese Higher Education Enters a New Era, , American Association of University Professors, Nov-Dec; Enterprise Ireland, (2010) International Students in Higher Education in Ireland 2009, , Enterprise Ireland; McAuley, L., Teaching and learning styles: A contrast between Ireland and China (2011) European Society of Engineering Education, pp. 508-512. , J Bernardino, J C Quadrado Lisbon; Sandnes, F., Experiences of teaching engineering students in Taiwan from a western perspective (2006) International Journal of Engineering Education, 22 (5), pp. 1013-1022; Qing, G., Maturity and interculturality: Chinese students' experiences in UK higher education (2009) European Journal of Education, 44 (1), pp. 37-52; (2012) College Student Eexperience Questionnaire Assessment Program, , http://cseq.iub.edu/index.cfm; Qing, G., Changing places: A study of Chinese students in the UK (2012) Language and Intercultural Communication, 8 (4), pp. 224-245; Mannion, D., The experience of Chinese students in Irish third level libraries: An investigation of current challenges and an analysis of possible solutions (2011) An Leabharlann: The Irish Library, 20 (2), pp. 19-20; Hofstede, G., (2011) Culture's Consequence: Comparing Values, Behaviours, Institutions, and Organisations Across Nations, , Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks CA; Kennedy, P., Learning cultures and learning styles: Myth-understandings about adult Chinese Learners (2002) Int.

The minor offered separate courses on financial management, human resource management, innovation, etc., but was not successful in integrating the different courses into a meaningful whole. As a result students lacked the opportunity to coherently understand and apply the competencies taught in the programme. For that reason an integrative course was developed. The design and experiences from three editions of the course are presented in this paper. The problem at stake is: what learning strategy is suitable to integrate the different competencies as acquired in the different courses of the minor 'Management in High Tech Contexts' into a meaningful whole? In this paper we study the authentic learning strategy, since it provides learners with a meaningful environment to coherently understand and apply knowledge and skills. The intention was not to develop a formal test to see if this integration had taken place in a satisfactory way, but to use a qualitative approach and build on the perception of the students as the main source of information. In spring 2012 we evaluated three editions of the new integrative course that was designed to meet the objectives that were raised by students and staff members three years earlier. The aim of the integrative course was to enable students to combine and apply the gained knowledge in such a way that they would obtain a better and coherent understanding. This course should provide the conditions needed to experience this understanding. The pedagogical design was built on several learning theories and new insights related to the use of media for learning. The authentic learning approach is the context in which this design has been materialized, hoping that the approach would allow for the different competencies to develop into a meaningful whole. The design principles for such an authentic learning environment are based on so called 'real world' settings in which students collaboratively create genuine products that are polished and professional, and that are shared and published. It is about knowledge in realistic contexts, realistic and complex tasks, using technology-based cognitive tools like in this setting social media and a serious game. The course consists of two learning cycles: a management consultancy cycle and a general management cycle. The consultancy part is based on yearly varying assignments from real companies in our network. The management part is executed using a general management simulation game in an authentic office setting. For the communication between all participants including the representatives of the company who supplied the real world case, was done using a social media tool and the institution's Learning Management System. The evaluations over the last three years show that the course solved most problems reported earlier. In particular, the choice for the authentic learning strategy contributed significantly to the integrated, deep understanding and application of management competencies. An important drawback of the actual approach is the time required to organize and teach the course. Our conviction is though that the approach would be widely applicable if the conditions such as 40h full-time time investment for the game week; self-organisation, group work, etc. could be refined and reduced in time. The paper covers the experiences with the authentic learning strategy, the practical issues and the evaluation results to, as an overlying objective, augment the discussion on designing engaging learning environments using different pedagogies and technology-based tools.","Authentic learning; Learning environment; Management competencies; Technology-based tools (case study & management game)","Complex networks; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Design; Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Management science; Product design; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Authentic learning; Authentic learning environment; Coherent understanding; Delft University of Technology; Financial managements; Learning environments; Learning management system; Management games; Human resource management","Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18 (1), pp. 32-42; Herrington, J., Oliver, R., An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments (2000) Educational Technology Research and Development, 48 (3), pp. 23-48; Herrington, J., Authentic e-learning in higher education: Design principles for authentic learning environments and tasks (2006) Proceedings of E-learn 2006, pp. 3164-3173. , T.

Projects can influence an engineering curriculum in various ways. This can be done at a course level and/or program level. Educators, students and industry clients are approaching project work as a key for social, academic and industrial partnership. In most Australian universities, in the final year, the students complete an individual project involving the application of skills and knowledge attained during their earlier years of their degree program. Through these projects students develop new abilities for application to a real-world problem, learn the art of modeling and simulation, design, development and management of an industry based or research based projects. Through project based learning teachers, students, and employers undertake different activities with varying purposes. This paper firstly presents data collected from final year undergraduate engineering units in all different engineering programs across the country. The findings from this research illustrate how students in various disciplines perform projects and as important shows the alignment or non-alignment of delivery, learning outcomes, and assessment activities. The types of projects available to students in the universities are also presented. Based on the findings, the research suggests that styles of teaching and learning environments can be adapted to the student's learning mode that could meet the requirements of our society at present. Based on this, the paper presents some novel frameworks in curriculum development to assist with constructive alignment when an engineering curriculum is based on learning through projects. This is then mapped to the local context in engineering at Deakin University Australia, which looks at the learning through projects theme in specially designed engineering learning spaces. Learning through projects has a positive effect on student content knowledge and the development of skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, and problem solving which increase their motivation and engagement. It is challenging task of teaching and teachers finding hard to implement the system, to integrate technology into projects in meaningful ways. When we look at the method of learning through Projects, it is a benefit for all the stakeholders such as students, industry, community, university involved in it. It provides us a framework for embedding experiential and rich learning activities, integrated with discipline-based curriculum that improves employment and career outcomes. The benefits of Project based learning include enhanced students' participation in the learning process (active learning and self-learning), enhanced communication skills, addressing of a wider set of learning styles, and promotion of critical and proactive thinking.","Engineering education; Engineering projects; Project based learning","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Problem solving; Project management; Research and development management; Students; Teaching; Constructive alignments; Curriculum development; Engineering project; Industrial partnerships; Motivation and engagements; Project based learning; Teaching and learning environments; Undergraduate engineering; Engineering education","Solomon, G., (2003) Project-based Learning: A Primer; Natascha Van Hattum-Janssen, R.M.V., (2007) Project Led Education in Engineering Courses: Competencies to Include; McGrath, D., (2003) Artifacts and Understanding, Learning & Leading with Technology; De Vere, I., (2009) Developing Creative Engineers: A Design Approach to Engineering Education; Hung, J.D., Liu, R., (2008) Problem Based Learning; Julie, E., Mills, D.F.T., (2003) Engineering Education - Is Problem Based Or Project Based Learning the Answer?; Krajcik, J., Czerniak, C.M., Berger, C.F., (1999) Teaching Science: A Project-based Approach, , New York: McGraw-Hill College; Yam, L.B.P., Student Engagement & teacher's Self': A case study of inclusive teaching (2009) 15th Annual Confernece of the Pacific Rim Real Estate Society, , University of Technology Sydney, Sydney; Wijnen, P.W.H.F.W., (1999) Towards Design-based Learning, in Educational Service Centre, , Technische Universiteit Eindhoven; Kolmos, A., Reflections on project work and problem-based learning (1996) European Journal of Engineering Education; Kolmos, A., Graaff, E., (2007) Management of Change, , History of Problem-based and Project-based learning, Sense Publisher; Du, X., Kolmos, A., Graaff, E., (2009) Research on PBL Practice in Engineering Education; Palmer, S., Hall, W., An evaluation of a project-based learning initiative in engineering education (2011) European Journal of Engineering Education; Michel, Management of change-implementation of problem-based and project-based learning in engineering (2009) European Journal of Engineering Education; Lima, R.M., A case study on project led education in engineering: Students' and teachers' perceptions (2007) European Journal of Engineering Education; Stojcevski, A., Fitrio, D., Project based learning curriculum in microelectronics engineering (2008) IEEE Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems; Malicky, D., Lord, S., (2006) Problem, Project, Inquiry, Or Subject-based Pedagogies: What to Do?, , American Society for Engineering Education; Helle, L., Tynjälä, P., Olkinuora, E., (2006) Project-based Learning in Post-secondary Education - Theory, Practice and Rubber Sling Shots, , Higher Education","Stojcevski, A.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Deakin UniversityAustralia",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

To achieve this, up-to-date, effective teaching methods are necessary, supported in part by more extensive faculty development programs [4]. Despite this need, participation in faculty development programs is not part of the prevalent culture of engineering education [4]. Besides the requirement for effective teaching in the ideal, engineering faculty are the role models for the new generations of engineers. As such, they have an additional major part to play in creating the Engineer of 2020 - faculty culture and attitudes must also reflect the collective vision. With the vision of global competence [5] in mind, international collaborations between preeminent universities and new institutions are becoming increasingly frequent. The international collaborations that deserve special attention are those attempting a complete ""institutional transplantation"" [6] of an educational entity from one region of the world to another. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is currently collaborating with the Singaporean government and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (MIT-SUTD Collaboration) to achieve such a transplantation. To accomplish the development of a new engineering-oriented university, while in parallel addressing the timely formation of an institutional identity and culture that borrows from those of MIT, the MIT team used the following model based on three critical building blocks: (a) Collaborative Curriculum Development, (b) Immersive Faculty Development Program (FDP), (c) Support systems for students' culture formation In this paper we discuss the faculty development program in the context of this collaborative transplantation effort, and present the program objectives and model as it is currently implemented at MIT.","Cultural transfusion; Faculty development program; Institutional transplantation in education; New engineering universities","C (programming language); Curricula; Education; Education computing; Engineers; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Cultural transfusion; Effective teaching methods; Engineering education systems; Engineering universities; Faculty development; International collaborations; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Technology and designs; Engineering education","Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, (1998) Engineering Criteria 2000, , Baltimore, MD; National Research Council, (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; National Academy of Engineering, (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , Washington, D.

Video analysis using program Tracker (Open Source Physics) or Coach in the educational process introduces a new creative method of teaching physics, makes natural sciences more interesting for the students. With the help of a high-speed camera and video analysis and modeling tools the students can study certain motion in detail. The video analysis gives the future engineers simple and easy way to understand the process of movement. The computer modeling enables the students to relate the results of measurements to theory showing relations between graphs obtained using a model and a measurement. Through direct visual comparison of the video images and model overlays the students can explore different model parameters and equations in real-work context, find differences and similarities between an idealized object and the reality. A comparison of the traditional teaching methods with the method of the video analysis using integrated ICT (information and communication technology) tools has revealed that the latter method is easier for the students, they have fun when recording and analyzing their own videos, they can set individual pace for their work. We can confirm that the competencies and knowledge of the students are developed and increased by working with video analysis and modeling tools. These tools help them to understand the natural sciences principles and phenomena more deeply, develop skills of abstraction and projection, awake curiosity towards nature and surrounding world and make physics a lot more fun. This paper deals with increasing of key competencies in engineering education as a result of using video analysis of real life situations as physical problems and the modeling tool programs Tracker (Open Source of Physics) and Coach. We found that education based on principles of pedagogical constructivism, use of managed discovery methods, and students' application of knowledge through experimentation, proved more effective than the use of the transmission methods (Krupová, 2009). Standardized questionnaires (Krist'ak, 2010) were used to determine the degree of knowledge of the students at the beginning (pretest) and at the end (post-test) of the semester. Our hypothesis was that the students who are taught using video analysis learn more actively and effectively than the students who are taught traditionally. We tested the hypothesis H0: The mean of the successfulness of the experimental and the control group is the same: H0: μ1 = μ2 (versus H1: μ1 = μ2). The assumption on the differences of the degree of knowledge were applied with the probability 95% (a = 5%). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (one-sample test) of normality at the level a = 5% was used for comparison of normal (Gaussian) distribution of generated histograms. First of all, we used an F-test for the null hypothesis that two normal populations (experimental and control groups) have the same variance (H0: σ12 = σ22 versus H1: σ12 ? σ22). After this hypothesis had been confirmed we used independent two-sample Student's t-test for unequal sample sizes and equal variances. The statistical testing using the t-test confirmed the significance of the differences in the knowledge of the experimental and control groups, which were caused by using the video analysis. We confirmed that the competencies of the students were developed and their knowledge was increased by working with Tracker and Coach compared to the group that was taught by using traditional teaching methods. We saw that the video analysis helps the students to understand the natural sciences principles more deeply and develops skills of abstraction and projection.","Engineering education; Key competencies; Video analysis","Abstracting; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; High speed cameras; Natural sciences; Statistical tests; Surveys; Teaching; Testing; Degree-of-knowledge; Educational process; Information and Communication Technologies; Key competencies; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Transmission methods; Unequal Sample Size; Video analysis; Students","Beichner, R.J., The impact of video motion analysis on kinematic graph interpretation skills (1996) American Journal of Physics, 64 (10), pp. 1272-1277; Brown, D., Cox, A.J., Innovative uses of video analysis (2009) The Physics Teacher, 47 (3), pp. 145-150; Bussei, P., Merlino, S., European workshop on multimedia in physics teaching and learning (2003) Europhysics News, 34 (3), pp. 116-117; Heck, A., Uylings, P., In a hurry to work with high-speed video at school (2010) The Physics Teacher, 48, pp. 176-181; Hockicko, P., Nontraditional approach to studying science and technology (2010) Communications, 12 (3), pp. 66-71; Hockicko, P., Forming of physical knowledge in engineering education with the aim to make physics more attractive (2011) Proceedings of International Conference Physics Teaching in Engineering Education PTEE 2011, , Mannheim, Germany, 2011; Halliday, D., Resnick, R., Walker, J., (2001) Fundamentals of Physics, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 6 edition; Krist'ák, L., Němec, M., Innovation of physical education at technical university in zvolen (2010) Journal of Technology and Information Education, 2 (2), pp. 40-45; Krupová, I., The development of natural science literacy in pupils in the first stage of basic school using the method of managed discovery (2009) Pedagogika, 61 (3), pp. 259-268. , 2009; Stebila, J., Research and prediction of the application of multimedia teaching aid in teaching technical education on the 2nd level of primary schools (2011) Informatics in Education, 10 (1), pp. 105-122","Hockicko, P.; University Teacher, Department of Physics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of ŽilinaSlovakia",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

There are many single activities that individually deals with the topic in a positive direction, such as teacher training, develop learning environments, develop teacher reward systems, etc. Traditionally educational development has been about these single activities focusing on individual teachers. But there has also been a change over time towards an increasingly focus on institutional strategies and even national policies. The academic development work in the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University will be used as an example of a successful integrating institutional strategy, which has managed to integrate and align several activities in a co-ordinated institutional strategy. The basic idea behind the development work is that teacher training is preferably done in a context with the purpose of not only supporting individuals but also developing the entire pedagogical culture from a learning perspective with Scholarship of Teaching and Learning as the leading star (as an institutional policy statement). The case is slightly different from the idea with an autonomous university center manufacturing the development - it is instead about a whole battery of integrating activities to interact on a contextual level such as teacher training courses, quality assurance system, scholarship activities, reward system, developing learning environments and resources, developing students, etc.","Institutional; Learning; Strategy; Teaching","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Personnel training; Quality assurance; Societies and institutions; Institutional; Institutional policies; Institutional strategy; Learning; Quality assurance systems; Scholarship of teaching and learning; Strategy; Teacher training course; Teaching","Gibbs, G., Developing students as learners - Varied phenomena, varied contexts and a developmental trajectory for the whole endeavour (2009) Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education, (1). , February; Knapper, C., Three decades of educational development (2003) International Journal for Academic Development, 8 (1-2), pp. 5-9; (2012) Strategic Plan 2012-2016, , Lund University, Faculty of Engineering LTH; Andersson, R., Improving Teaching - Done in a context (2010) Learning to Teach in Higher Education - Approaches and Case Studies in Europe, , Maria Lucia Giovannini ed., CLUEB; Olsson, T., Mårtensson, K., Roxå, T., Pedagogical competence - A development perspective from Lund University (2010) A Swedish Perspective on Pedagogical Competence, pp. 121-132. , R.

Engineers play a key role in transforming ideas and inventions into innovations that create value for users [1]. But successful innovation requires a broad set of skills that is beyond a profound technological knowledge, as for example communication skills, the ability to work in a team or competences in project management. The National Academy of Sciences [2] draws an interesting scenario for future engineers in the year 2020 referring to societal, global, and professional contexts of engineering practice. The most meaningful change with a tremendous impact on today's engineering education can be identified as an accelerating global economy. The world's economy has become increasingly interlinked over the last few decades due to technological innovations which unfolds the importance of efficient collaboration in international teams. Furthermore, the steady increase in knowledge leads to a growing complexity which requires a systems perspective on engineering problems. In consequence, the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of experts is inevitable and shows the challenges in communication and teamwork which engineers will have to face. The academic outlook by the National Academy of Sciences summarizes in a very extensive way various perceptions concerning current developments in engineering education. Additional to a scientific point of view, challenges for today's engineering education can also be derived from industry's actual requirements. However, surveys (e.g. [3]; [4]) reveal a gap between the industry's needs and university curricula and graduates perceive similar lacks in education themselves. To successfully meet these needs a paradigm shift in engineering education that focuses on a more comprehensive approach and on the development of human potential is necessary (e.g. [5]). Hence, ways of implementing a holistic engineering education including approaches for sustainable career development will be discussed by using the example of MCI (Management Center Innstbruck), an Austrian engineering school. To complete the idea of supporting the individual development as professional and to increase the degree of adaptability to dynamic changes in global markets and technologies a reflective approach is introduced. Based on Weinert's understanding [6], competences are conceptualized as context-related dispositions that enable people to successfully solve problems. From an engineering educator's point of view, this draws the attention on how students can be supported in developing this sort of competence and what contribution can be made to foster this disposition and to facilitate a more holistic engineering education. Becoming a professional, in the sense of being a full member of a community of practice [7], is a lifelong process which additionally requires reflective competence in order to identify and develop one's individual potential. Thus, fostering reflective competence is supposed to be an indispensable part of engineering education. This way individual experience can be used more productively to increase engineering students' employability by actively designing their personalized curriculum and benefiting from individual talents. Preparing graduates for a lifelong learning process also has to include the preparation for the handling of individual experience in communities of practice. The reflective competence which is required to profit from experience and to increase the possibility of transfer can already be supported in engineering schools. The increased consideration of individual experience in learning processes and in the support of a sustainable career development shows how important it is to allow for experience not only during internships in companies but also during the whole technical study program. Therefore, creating a constructivist learning environment instead of the predominant model - ""talk and chalk"" [8] - in engineering education is necessary although not always easy to realize. But there are some promising approaches, e.g. project-based learning, that enable experience that is close to professional reality since the biggest part of an engineer's professional practice is project related. The paper ends with pointing out tools to enlarge the sustainability of practical experience which are suitable to accompany learning processes and foster the engagement with the individual learning history.","Holistic engineering education; Reflective competence","Computer aided instruction; Cultivation; Curricula; Education; Education computing; Employment; Engineers; Human resource management; International trade; Knowledge acquisition; Online systems; Personnel; Professional aspects; Project management; Students; Sustainable development; Communities of Practice; Constructivist learning; Holistic engineering educations; Multi-disciplinary teams; National Academy of Science; Reflective competence; Technological development; Technological innovation; Engineering education","Wnek, G.E., Williamson, S., (2010) Holistic engineering education: Beyond Technology, , D.

It must be based on accurate and comparable data and information. Graduation is a good time to gather feedback from graduates on their education, the competencies they have gained and how that relates to their career prospects. This information serves as a good tool when evaluating the quality of university education. Academic Engineers and Architects in Finland TEK and four Finnish universities of higher engineering education conducted a joint feedback survey on national scale for M.Sc. graduates in engineering and architecture in 2011. The universities involved were the four schools of technology in Aalto University, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Tampere University of Technology and the Faculty of Technology at the University of Oulu. It is worth noticing that this graduate feedback survey covers 95 % of the Finnish M.Sc. graduates of technology making it a very extensive research. A total of 550 graduates, which is roughly 30 % of all annual graduates, participated in the survey. The main target of the feedback survey is to gather comparable information on the quality of the M.Sc. degrees, the competencies gained by the graduates and their employment after graduation. It is common for the Finnish university students to work during studies. It is often debated whether or not this is recommendable and what are the impacts. The results of the feedback survey made in 2011 show that on average the M.Sc. graduates have 18 months of working life experience. From that, two thirds is related to the actual field of study. The impact of working on study progress is two-fold; 38 % of graduates said working had slowed down the studies. However, 58 % felt working had no impact on the progress. According to the feedback, 90% of the students felt that the working life experience had improved their professional competencies. These include field specific know-how, adaptation of theory to practise, problem solving skills as well as communication and project skills. It seems that working experience had promoted the employment rate and quality of the graduates. Already at the time of graduation, 95 % of the graduates had been employed to positions and responsibilities that responded well or moderately well to their M.Sc. degree. An interesting result is also that over 50 % of the graduates had been employed via the working life contacts. Work experience related to field of study should therefore be seen as an important channel of employment. The changing demands of working life place new challenges for the content and methods of education. It is worth considering; could on-the-job-learning be better integrated and utilized for example in the adaptation of the important working life competencies? In May 2012 a work seminar focusing on the utilization of the feedback survey results was organized by TEK and the participating universities. In addition to the survey results, themes discussed in the seminar were guidance in the early phases of study, career guidance and abilities for lifelong learning. Comparable data, shared experiences and best practices turned out to be the most valuable outcome of the feedback project. The cooperation between the parties involved was deepened. This cooperation alongside the collected feedback data and the outcome of the seminar serve as a good base for the work towards better engineering education. The annual feedback survey, work seminar and a report of their results and outcomes are meant to form a long term, continuous entity. The target is not only to offer comparable data and develop engineering education in general, but also to provide a practical tool for the universities to deepen their cooperation. TEK provides the forum and acts as a coordinator of the survey.","Competencies; Employment; Engineering graduates; Feedback","Architecture; Decision making; Education; Employment; Feedback; Felt; Problem solving; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Technology transfer; Competencies; Data and information; Engineering graduates; Higher engineering educations; Problem solving skills; Professional competencies; University education; University students; Engineering education","http://www.aalto.fi; http://www.lut.fi; http://www.oulu.fi; http://www.tut.fi; http://www.tek.fi/ci/pdf/koulutus/final_tek_yliopistokoul_keh; Honkanen, S., (2011) Modelling of Study Paths Leading to Graduation of Engineering Students - Based on Study Success in Secondary School and Early Phases of Study, , University of Oulu, Oulu; Korhonen-Yrjänheikki, K., (2011) Future of the Finnish Engineering Education - A Collaborative Stakeholder Approach, , Academic Engineers and Architects in Finland TEK, Helsinki","Hyotynen, P.; Education and Employment Policy, Academic Engineers and Architects in Finland TEKFinland",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

Also the information needs and actions taking place vary among different stakeholders. Generally, we can divide different actors into three major strands, which represent the different approaches and perspectives. Societal macro level represents the educational system and global alliances approach focusing on ideology, social context and policy-making. Meso level represents the organisational and institutional conditions: plans, policies and everyday management. Micro level deals with cognitive and emotional aspects of learning and teaching including individual's learning history, learning styles, etc. taking place in classrooms and peer interactions. In this paper we provide three different perspectives towards information and actions based on the work done in the ATTRACT project working group ""Student Retention"". ATTRACT (Enhance the Attractiveness of Studies in Science and Technology) is a European Commission supported project aiming to increase knowledge and inform practice about student recruitment and retention in engineering and technology education. The project compares situations in partner countries and broadens national discussion on European level. As Becher [1] has demonstrated, comparative studies in higher education tend to focus on macro-level contrasts between the structures of one system and another. In the ATTRACT project, however, we wanted to explore deeper the different practices carried out by the participating universities. In the last year of the project several trials took place and provided different approaches to information and actions: • Footprint • Working with questionnaires • Interaction, academic integration and tutoring The first trial aimed to test and evaluate a method of visualising and monitoring student retention in a socalled footprint in selected fields of programs. This trial typically represents the organisational and societal level of information gathering and visualisation. The purpose of the second trial was to benchmark practices in gathering information from large groups of students on their perceptions of studies, orientation, study choices and academic integration. This trial focused on serving the meso level, but also provided background information for actions on the micro level. Finally, the third trial focused on the issue of interaction between students and staff with special emphasis on the interaction supporting academic integration of students and student progression, and the early identification of students at risk.

To meet these educational needs, the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering of the KU Leuven and the Leuven Engineering and Science Education Centre (LESEC) have been investing heavily in the implementation, development and optimalisation of a student-centred teaching method: project-based learning (PBL). Because the correct interpretation of the coaching role is crucial for the success of PBL, an educational research project (OWP/2010) was started to define and optimise the role of the coach in PBL[2]. In PBL a group of students works on a problem for a longer period of time, in consultation with a coach who guides and facilitates the learning and the self-development of the students [3]. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the coaching is crucial for the success of the project. But in spite of all the scientific studies that have been done about this teaching method, insufficient light has been shed on the interpretation of the role of the coach [4]. What is needed is a model which helps the coaches with defining the best coaching method for each specific project or group of students. The objective of this research project is to develop, implement and validate a coaching model in the science and engineering education of our university [5]. Firstly, a theoretical framework was created that collects all the different aspects of coaching into specific coaching roles. This overview collects and uniformly defines all this different roles and served as the theoretical foundation of the further research. Based on this framework a survey was conducted (800 students, 50 coaches) to study the role of the coach in PBL. An in-depth statistical analysis of these surveys was done and used to map out the relationship between the key factors of the research: the coaching roles, the learning objectives and the learning outcome. These results were used to develop the proposed coaching model, which presents the coaches with the best method for coaching the students in a specific project, based on the learning objectives of this specific project (See Fig. 1). The next step in our research project will be the development of an accompanying web application and manual to facilitate the use and dissemination of the coaching model in the educational practice. The goal of this web application is to transforms the theoretical coaching model into an easy-to-use instrument whereby the coach can determine the optimal coaching profile based on the characteristics of their project. In addition a manual will be developed that serves as an easy-to-use reference work and provides the coaches with the necessary information and guidelines to successfully take on these coaching roles.","Facilitating self-study and self-development; Project-based learning; Role of the coach","Education; Education computing; Employment; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Teaching; World Wide Web; Educational research; Facilitating self-study and self-development; Project based learning; Role of the coach; Science and engineering; Student centred teachings; Theoretical foundations; Theoretical framework; Engineering education","Attard, A., Di Loio, E., Geven, K., Santa, R., (2010) Student Centered Learning: An Insight Into Theory and Practice, pp. 6-15. , Partos Timisoara, Bucharest; Heylen, C., (2010) Problem Solving and Engineering Design: Introducing Students to Engineering Practice, pp. 3-10. , Ph.

The impact of attitudes of teachers to the satisfaction of the students is an important question that was hardly in the focus of empirical research so far. The project ""Lewi - teaching effectiveness and interventions"" seeks to explore empirically the relationship between patterns of attitudes of the teachers and the impact on teaching and the students. In addition, this project will develop, implement and evaluate a special coaching for teachers at university. In the first phase of the project, qualitative and quantitative instruments were developed to evaluate the attitudes of teachers towards teaching, the bologna process, the students, aspects of gender and diversity and further training. On the basis of a german-wide online survey and qualitative interviews with teachers at three universities an individual, process-oriented coaching instrument for teachers was developed and implemented. The teachers were accompanied for a semester and coached in several courses. The coaching takes care of the individual interests of teachers and encourages them to make new teaching experiences. Through this guidance the teachers also learn to consider their teaching from the perspective of students. To evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, they were supervised scientifically: The coaching concept provides several measure points during the semester. Short interviews, feedback sessions, participant observation and surveys with teachers and students were used. So far a total of 32 teachers were coached. The focus was mainly on engineering education and engineering courses. The results of the interventions document a number of changes (e.g. towards the satisfaction of teachers and students): The interaction between students and teachers and the teaching environment were improved, the students were activated and teachers are able to recognize the learning progress of the students and so could better assess what was (not) understood. However, it takes time for both sides: For the teachers to change their approach or concept of teaching and for the students to get used to these changes. The approach outlined here represents a novel approach to university teaching interventions, because the empirical analysis of the relationship between teaching and learning in engineering education were created as comparative studies in different contexts and universities. In addition, the results contribute in several ways from the quality assurance of teaching, as they fed back to the cooperating teachers and faculties. The results of the interventions will be presented at the 40th SEFI Annual Conference and discussed with the participants.","Engineering education; Gender and diversity research; Higher education","Education; Engineering education; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Quality assurance; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Comparative studies; Higher education; Individual interests; Participant observations; Qualitative interviews; Teaching and learning; Teaching effectiveness; University teaching; Teaching","Braun, E., Hannover, B., Zum Zusammenhang zwischen Lehr-Orientierung und Lehr-Gestaltung (2008) Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft, 10 (9), pp. 277-291. , Sonderheft/2008; Heise, E., Hasselhorn, M., Hager, W., Lehrevaluation, Lehrveranstaltungszufriedenheit und Leistung (2008) Psychologie in Erziehung und Unterricht, 50, pp. 43-57; Westermann, R., Spies, K., Heise, E., Wollburg-Claar, S., Bewertung von Lehrveranstaltungen und Studienbedingungen durch Studierende: Theorieorientierte Entwicklung von Fragebögen (1998) Empirische Pädagogik, 12, pp. 133-166; Coffes, M., Gibbs, G., Measuring teachers̈ repertoire of teaching methods (2002) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 27 (49), pp. 383-390; Heise, E., Zaepernick-Rothe, U., Zufriedenheit von Lehrenden an deutschen Universitäten mit ihrer Lehrtätigkeit Die Hochschule - Journal für Wissenschaft und Bildung; Bortz, J., Döring, N., (2006) Forschungsmethoden und Evaluation, , Springer Verlag, Heidelberg; Diekmann, A., (2007) Empirische Sozialforschung: Grundlagen, Methoden, Anwendungen, , Berlin; Lamnek, S., (2005) Qualitative Sozialforschung, , Weinheim/Beltz Verlag, Basel; Wiesner, H., Kamphans, M., Schelhowe, H., Metz-Göckel, S., Zorn, I., Drag, A., Peter, U., Schottmüller, H., (2004) Leitfaden zur Umsetzung des Gender Mainstreaming in den ""Neuen Medien in der Bildung-Förderbereich Hochschule"", , Bremen/Dortmund; Mey, G., Mruck, K., (2004) Grounded Theory Reader, , HSR Supplement 19.

Faculty members in every discipline are encouraged to develop personalized experiential learning opportunities for their students in order to offset the impact of fiscal restraint in their classrooms. Many engineering educators in North America are looking to Community Service-Learning as a possibility [3]. This paper explores a possible new role for technical communication courses in the engineering curriculum, as exemplified by a Reading Week (Spring Break) project in Applied Science XXX: Technical Communication at The University of X in Y. At The University of X, Applied Science XXX is a regular, required credit course for engineering students in all disciplines: enrollment is 30-35 students per section, with approximately 28 sections per academic year. Students must pass this course to register for their final year of the Bachelor of Applied Science programme in Engineering. As such, it is highly standardized, with the same syllabus, the same textbook, and the same assignments and exams for all sections. The course introduces engineering students to several aspects of technical and professional communication: proposals, formal reports, team presentations, mechanism descriptions, instruction sets, and business correspondence, such as letters and memoranda, in response to socially contextualized case studies. In the January-April 2012 term, over half the students in one section opted to write a proposal and formal report that incorporated critical reflection on their experiences of mentoring elementary school children in various science projects at inner-city schools in Y. If ""community service-learning is an educational approach that integrates service in the community with intentional learning activities"" [4], how does this optional Community Service-Learning opportunity specifically reinforce the core concepts of ""audience and purpose"" in technical communication? And further, how might it ""change the conversation"" of engineering, as posited by the National Academy of Engineering [1]? A variety of Community Service-Learning opportunities in technical communication can be made relevant to engineering students in all disciplines if they are framed in terms of a larger social context, with explicit reference to economic, pedagogical, and ethical drivers. Emerging ideas of ""global engineering"" [5], [6] both at micro- and macro-levels will be explored as they relate to the pedagogy of engineering as service. How various professional codes of ethics play a key role in effecting social change will also be discussed. This larger discussion serves as a framework for examination of team proposals and formal reports in AP-SC XXX. Drawing upon critical reflections in these two written assignments (used with permission), it is argued that technical communication courses are uniquely positioned to change public mis/perception of engineering, directly contributing to social change at a grassroots level if scaffolded appropriately. A possible new role for technical communication is that of a broader role, as it moves from its marginal status as ""handmaid"" servicing the engineering profession to a mainstream community participant serving humanity.","Community service-learning; Engineering ethics; Global engineering; Technical communication","Curricula; Education; Philosophical aspects; Professional aspects; Students; Teaching; Bachelor of applied science; Community service learning; Engineering ethics; Engineering profession; Global engineerings; National Academy of Engineering; Professional communication; Technical communications; Engineering education","Committee on Public Understanding of Engineering Messages, (2008) National Academy of Engineering, , http://www.engineeringmessages.org/23673/24692.aspx, Changing the Conversation: Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineering, National Academies Press, Washington, DC.

However, this role is claimed under-researched and incompletely understood [4]. In general, engineering education has been taught in relatively traditional environments and buildings. Furthermore, engineering education has been rather teacher-centred and has often taken place in large lecture theatres [5]. Still, it also faces the rapid changes in the knowledge society and the accelerating pace of the changes, which challenge educational development in general [6, 7]. New technologies and pedagogical views challenge teaching, and the academic teaching faculty strives to keep up with this process. This study surveys the faculty's perceptions, expectations and wishes considering teaching and learning environments at their own university campus. When a university has gone through a renovation in its buildings or a new building has been designed, academic teaching faculty has not got an active role in the process but architects and consulting companies have mainly been involved in the design process. We aimed to gain insight into how teachers would like to develop and design the teaching and learning spaces at their university. Our prior perception was that university teachers and students are experts of reflecting on best possible teaching and learning environments. However, this study focused on the teachers' perceptions. Additionally, another prior perception was that academic teachers should be involved into the design processes of the environments as active partners and planners, and use their expertise to enhance overall quality in engineering education. The data collected were qualitative and collected with semi-structured interviews. We could divide the findings into two larger categories. The respondents regarded their environment and its development in physical or material ideas and thoughts, or either in immaterial things, as in form of social interaction. The results indicated that above all teachers yearned for more social interaction between different groups; teachers, students and others working at the School. Current environment did not enough support this. The respondents indicated that more interaction between different groups, either formally during the courses or informally e.g. meeting people in the corridors or other public spaces, would enhance motivation and better learning in the studies. The arrangement of the space and the readily installed ICT appear to dictate the applied teaching methods and technologies. Traditionally arranged lecture theatres and classrooms mostly support only oneway delivery of information from teacher to students [5]. The results of this study indicated that the teachers are interested in the new technologies that can improve teaching. It seems, however, that the teachers very seldom adapt new technologies in teaching on their own. It is possible that adapting successfully new technologies in teaching without prior experience is time-consuming and that reduces the teachers' interest in taking part of the development process. The development process should start from the pedagogical philosophy and awareness, and then include those technologies which support teaching at best in each course. Further research is needed to cover this area more widely, in particular in engineering education.","Electrical engineering; Learning and teaching environments","Auditoriums; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Students; Technical presentations; Consulting companies; Development process; Learning and teachings; Learning environments; Semi structured interviews; Teachers' perceptions; Teaching and learning; Teaching and learning environments; Teaching","Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), (2006) Designing Spaces for Effective Learning: A Guide to 21st Century Learning Space Design, , http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/learningspaces.pdf; Oblinger, D.G., (2006) Learning Spaces, , http://www.educause.edu/LearningSpaces, Educause, Boulder, CO; Temple, P., (2007) Learning Spaces for the 21st Century: A Review of the Literature, , http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/publications/learning_spaces_21st_century, The Higher Education Academy; Temple, P., Learning spaces in higher education: An under-researched topic (2008) London Review of Education, 6 (3), pp. 229-241; Jamieson, P., Designing more effective on-campus teaching and learning spaces: A role for academic developers (2003) Int.

For instance, they may differ in terms of how they think about learning and knowledge. We investigated what kind of student groups can be identified on the basis of students' motivational strategies and conceptions of learning and knowledge. These variables, when clustered into orientations, have been shown to relate to students well-being and study success [1]. Their relation to study engagement is less clear. We wanted to see, what kinds of orientations could be identified in electrical engineering students by using cluster analyses. Further, it was of interest, whether such clusters of students would differ in terms of study engagement and well-being. The context was electrical engineering, and the participants were Bachelor students (n = 224) at Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering. The students filled in a questionnaire in the beginning of the spring semester 2012. The majority of the sample was of first and second year students. Furthermore, they were from five different courses in the Degree Programme of Electronics and Electrical Engineering. The questionnaire [2, 3] measured study engagement, motivational strategies, and epistemological beliefs. The data were analysed with quantitative methods, and cluster analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. We identified three clusters of students, labelled as dysfunctional students, theoristsand reflective professionals. ""Dysfunctional students"" were the least optimistic, appreciated certain and practical knowledge and were not interested in reflection. ""Theorists"" scored high on optimism and they emphasized the value of reflection. ""Reflective professionals"" were optimistic, appreciated certain and practical knowledge but were also interested in reflection. It appeared that ""dysfunctional students"" expressed the lowest levels of study engagement and well-being. Our further inquiries shall reveal, whether different student groups vary in terms of learning outcomes in the context of electrical engineering. Likewise, our aim is to study how different student groups experience their learning environment. They may react differently in new educational innovations in engineering.","Electrical engineering; Epistemological beliefs; Motivational strategies; Study engagement","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Cluster analysis; Computer aided instruction; Education; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Surveys; Educational innovations; Electrical engineering students; Electronics and electrical engineerings; Epistemological beliefs; Learning environments; Motivational strategies; Quantitative method; Study engagement; Students","Lonka, K., Sharafi, P., Karlgren, K., Masiello, I., Nieminen, J., Birgegård, G., Josephson, A., MED NORD - A tool for measuring medical students' well-being and study orientations (2008) Medical Teacher, 30, pp. 72-79; Honkanen, S., (2011) Modelling of Study Paths Leading to Graduation of Engineering Students-based on Study Success in Secondary School and Early Phases of Studies (in Finnish), , herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9789514293320/isbn9789514293320.pdf, PhD Thesis, University of Oulu; Gasiewski, J.A., Eagan, M.K., Garcia, G.A., Hurtado, S., Chang, M.J., Gatekeeping to engagement: A multicontextual mixed method study of student academic engagement in introductory STEM courses (2012) Research in Higher Education, 53, pp. 229-261; Erkkilä, M., Teknillisen korkeakoulun kandidaattivaiheen opiskelijoiden opintojen eteneminen lukuvuosina 2005-2009 (in Finnish) (2010) TKK Opetuksen ja Opiskelun Tuki, , http://opetuki2.tkk.fi/p/opintojenseuranta/documents/TKK-opintojen-eteneminen-2005-2009-FINAL.pdf; Leppävirta, J., (2011) Engineering Students' Proficiency in Electromagnetics, , http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2011/isbn9789526041919/isbn9789526041919.pdf, PhD Thesis.

This paper focuses on a specific type of plagiarism in the form of student copying of technical analysis amongst undergraduate engineering students. Our research question is ""Do rates of plagiarism vary between oncampus and offcampus (online distance) student cohorts?"" Research in this area is limited but suggests that academic dishonesty is less common in online courses compared to courses delivered oncampus. A third-year engineering hydrology course offered by a regional Australian university is delivered to oncampus and offcampus students and thus presents a research opportunity to evaluate plagiarism differences between the two cohorts. Both student cohorts have submitted their assignments electronically in the form of Excel spreadsheets over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011). During the assignment grading process, a number of plagiarism incidents were detected by the course markers from both student cohorts. Plagiarism rates were also examined retrospectively using the detection software Excel-Smash developed by Hellyer and Beadle. Excel Smash detected more plagiarised spreadsheets than the human markers, and this was considered to be partly due to each human marker seeing only a proportion of the submitted assignments. Both human markers and Excel-Smash found that oncampus rates of plagiarism were significantly higher than offcampus rates. Overall, Excel-Smash found 10.7% of assignments submitted by oncampus students were subject to plagiarism, compared to only 1.4% of the offcampus students. Copying of assignment work was generally contained to small groups of two, occasionally three, students. Many of the detected oncampus students were international students indicating more needs to be done discouraging this student group from engaging in plagiarism. Overall, Excel-Smash was found to be a rapid and useful tool to detect plagiarism cases using electronically submitted spreadsheets. Given that there is a substantial difference between student cohorts, a more targeted approach with the management of human markers could be introduced. Instead of grouping students alphabetically for marking as is current practice, increased plagiarism detection may result if a single marker is assigned to the oncampus submissions. Repeat offences of assignment copying despite the threat of academic penalty and the high proportion of oncampus plagiarism cases involving international students are two focus areas that should be addressed by careful implementation of intervention strategies.","Assignment checking; Engineering ethics; Plagiarism","Education; Engineering education; Grading; Hydrology; Infiltration; Intellectual property; Social networking (online); Spreadsheets; Assignment checking; Engineering ethics; Engineering hydrology; International students; Intervention strategy; Plagiarism; Research opportunities; Undergraduate engineering students; Students","Wan, R., Nordin, S., Halib, M., Ghazali, Z., Plagiarism among undergraduate students in an engineering-based university: An exploratory analysis (2011) European Journal of Social Sciences, 25 (4), pp. 537-549; Harding, T.S., On the frequency and causes of academic dishonesty among engineering students (2001) Proceedings: 2001 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Albuquerque, New Mexico, 24-27 June, 2001; Ledwith, A., Risquez, A., O'Dwyer, M., The role of the Internet in academic honesty: A comparison of engineering and business students.

Engineering Schools are therefore under increasing pressure to more clearly define what graduates from four or five year engineering programs should knowand be able to do. This paper describes a simple, but elegant stakeholder process that can be used to define the capabilities of a graduate who could claim in-depth techni-cal competence in their discipline. The Defining Your Discipline (DYD) Process [4] may be used by educational institutions and industry organisations to develop practitioner-authenticated sets of graduate capabilitiesfor their disci-pline. Environmental engineering was the test case for this new process. At the heart of the DYD process is the definition of tasks, in this case the tasks which a graduate from a program should be able to do in their first two or three years after graduation. Stakeholders are given a set of large sticky notes on which they are asked to write, on each note, one task that they would expect a recent graduate to be able to perform in their company. For academics, this is an imaginary task, while for industry representatives, who usually have considerable experience in supervising young graduates, it is more authentic as they know the sorts of tasks that a recent graduate should be able to complete. After about 20-30 minutes, most participants come to a stop. They can't think of any more tasks. Sometimes, it is helpful for them to talk to people around them for more ideas. This might last another 10-15 minutes. So, within 40-50 minutes participants are ready for the next stage, which is to clusterthe tasks into meaningful groups. This takes another 20-30 min-utes. There is usually quite a bit of discussion about the names of the clus-ters, and when negotiating the cluster into which an individual task belongs. The outcomes for environmental engineering are shown in Figure 1. In this case, the clusters are shown along the right hand side of the cube (investiga-tion, modelling & analysis, integrated design, assessment of impact, environ-mental planning, audit etc. The other two faces of the cube represent techni-cal domains (water, soils, etc) and generic skills (teamwork, communication, etc). The paper demonstrates an efficient process for determining the graduate outcomes for an engineering degree. The same process is also being tested on non-engineering programs. The process is efficient in terms of stakeholder time, taking about one and a half hours to collect 100-200 tasks to be ac-complished by a young graduate, depending on the attendance. The partici-pants categorise these tasks into clusters and these can then be synthesised with the results from other workshops.","Curriculum design, environmental engineering; Engineering curriculum; Graduate capabilities; Stakeholder consultation","Curricula; Education; Environmental engineering; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Curriculum designs; Educational institutions; Engineering curriculum; Engineering degrees; Graduate capabilities; Industry organisation; Industry representatives; Stakeholder consultation; Engineering education","Institution of Engineers Australia, (1996) Changing the Culture: Engineering Education Into the Future, , Institution of Engineers Australia: Canberra; Engineers Australia, (2011) Stage 1 Competency Standard for Professional Engineer, , Engineers Australia: Canberra; King, R., (2008) Addressing the Supply and Quality of Engineering Graduates for the New Century, , http://www.olt.gov.au/resource-addressing-supply-quality-engineering-graduates-uts-2008, Accessed 19 June 2012; Dowling, D., Hadgraft, R., (2012) The DYD Stakeholder Consultation Process: A Users Guide (Draft# 1), , University of Southern Queensland: Toowoomba; Dowling, D., Hadgraft, R., (2012) Graduate Capabilities for Environmental Engineering Degree Programs: A Guide for Australian Universities (Draft # 2), , University of Southern Queensland: Toowoomba, QLD; Barrie, S., A Research-based approach to generic graduate attributes policy (2004) Higher Education Research and Development, 23 (2), p. 262; RMIT University, (2012) Graduate Attributes, , http://www.rmit.edu.au/teaching/graduateattributes, Accessed 19 June 2012; University of Southern Queensland, (2012) The Qualities of a USQ Graduate, , http://policy.usq.edu.au/portal/custom/detail/the-qualities-of-a-usq-graduate, Accessed 19 June 2012; Cameron, I., Hadgraft, R., Engineering and ICT learning and teaching academic standards statement (2010) Learning and Teaching Academic Standards Project, , Australian Learning and Teaching Council: Sydney; Dowling, D.G., Hadgraft, R.G., A systematic consultation process to define graduate outcomes for engineering disciplines (2011) Research in Engineering Education Symposium, , Madrid","Dowling, D.G.; Department of Engineering Education, University of Southern QueenslandAustralia",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

This paper presents data from a triangulation process to validate our previous data whereby we interview practitioners in engineering companies about their workplace context and practice and we present preliminary results of this on-going research. In addition, given that engineering is a visual culture, we discuss the need for models to visually represent engineering practice at the macro, meso and micro level and drawing on the work of Gibbons et al., James Trevelyan and Rachel Itabashi Campbell, as well as the empirical data we ourselves have collected, we make proposals for what such representations could look like. Subsequently, we describe the qualitative data gathering we are carrying out and share practitioners' experiences on issues relating to technical coordination and to professional judgment relating to delivery deadlines. The fact that our findings regarding the central role of technical coordination in the workplace practice of Portuguese engineers correspond with those reported for engineers in Australia would suggest that this is an important area for future study and is one which merits consideration in the design of engineering education curricula.

It is believed that perceptions surrounding engineering and engineering identity play an important role in both engineering education and engineering practice. This is based on the notion that engineering identities affect student interest in engineering careers, contribute to a society's technical literacy, influence the value placed on engineering, and shape positions on innovation excellence [1]. However, very few studies have contrasted perceptions of engineering work and understandings of engineering identity across generations. Understanding how novice developing engineers (students) perceive engineering can provide insights into what attracts students into engineering as well as what might be repelling them from the field. This stands in contrast to perceptions of engineering among practitioners of older generations. Unfolding a complete view of these perceptions across developmental stages of engineering can deepen our understanding of identity formation and inform discussions of recruitment and retention. 1. METHOD AND RESULTS This study compared the perceptions of engineers and engineering work held by engineering students at a large American university and practicing engineers from over 40 industrial firms across the United States. Over 300 engineering students and over 400 practicing engineers responded to surveys asking them to select words describing their workplace and other engineers. The top five words most frequently chosen as representing engineering for field practicing engineers includes: technical, detail oriented, hard working, team oriented and innovative. In contrast engineering the top five words chosen by engineering students were: thorough, detail oriented, competitive, independent and confident. 2. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Engineering as an identity is not homogeneous; rather each unique engineering discipline brings with it a unique engineering culture, set of attributes and values. In addition it is evident that the perception of engineering identity and culture differs among engineering students and engineering practitioners and across the generations that responded to the surveys. Acknowledging the subtle or not-so-subtle differences between engineering discipline identities can allow secondary school and university advisors to more directly guide students toward a discipline of engineer education that is most closely aligned with their own attributes and value systems. The least represented descriptors such as extrovert, entrepreneurial and artistic are frequently associated with entrepreneurial interests and endeavours. This research seems to reinforce the void of these attributes amongst working engineering professionals, and the need for developing these attributes in the next generation.","Engineering culture; Engineering identity; Perception of engineering","Education; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Surveys; Developmental stage; Engineering culture; Engineering disciplines; Engineering practices; Engineering practitioners; Engineering professionals; Perceptions of engineering; Practicing engineers; Professional aspects","Tonso, K.L., Student engineers and engineer identity: Campus engineer identities as figured world (2006) Cultural Studies of Science Education, 1, pp. 273-307; Anderson, K.J.B., Shaw, S.S., Mcglamery, T., Nathans-Kelly, T.M., Nicometob, C.G., Understanding engineering work and identity: A cross-case analysis of engineers within six firms (2010) Engineering Studies, 2 (3), pp. 153-174; Giddens, D.P., (2008) Changing the Conversation - Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineering, , National Academy of Engineering of the National Academies: Washington, DC. p. 1-149; Harris Interactive, (2004) American Perspectives on Engineers and Engineering, , Conducted for the American Association of Engineering Societies; Fouad, N.A., Singh, R., Stemming the tide: Why women leave engineering (2011) Women in Engineering 2011 Report, pp. 1-64. , Wisconsin; Confessore, G.J., Herrmann, R.W., Developing self-efficacy among baccalaureate students: Pygmalion revisited (1997) Expanding Horizons in Self-directed Learning, pp. 169-181. , Long, H.

Technology transfer from basic research poses highest demands to the interdisciplinary cooperation in order to help elderly people. At the same time the product development is coming up to limits of affordability, limits of effectiveness and ethics. The rapid developments in the fields of social robotics and medicine as well as the urgency of the social problem turn AAL into one of the most innovative areas. The objective of this article is to explore the outcomes of interdisciplinary collaboration along the value added change including the fundamental research, product development and user inclusion site of view. The Adaptable Ambient Living ASsistant (ALIAS) project aims to develop a mobile robot system that interacts with elderly users, monitors and provides cognitive assistance in daily life, and promotes social inclusion by creating connections to people and events in the wider world. The function of ALIAS is to keep the elderly users linked to the wide society and in this way to improve their quality of life by combating loneliness and increasing cognitively stimulating activities. ALIAS is embodied by a mobile robot platform with the capacity to monitor, interact with and access information from online services, without manipulation capabilities. ALIAS is not designed to replace human-human contacts, but rather, to enhance and promote these through the proposed wide range of integrated services. By serving as a monitor, a cognitive-prosthetic device and a facilitator of social contacts, the ALIAS system will significantly improve the daily life of elderly people. The ALIAS-project is characterized by a close cooperation of social scientist and engineers. The teams exchange information permanently and an interdisciplinary work of high quality is ensured. There is a permanent feedback between social and technical work packages. The objective is to develop a robot platform that adjusts to the individual wishes and needs of the elderly people. For this purpose the users have been involved at a very early stage of the project. Thus the research Area ""Gender Studies in Science"" has conducted inquiries, workshops and interviews with different user groups (e.g. seniors, relatives, caregivers and care consultants) and has realized a secondary analysis. The results of the investigations are fed back to the technical partners and have been incorporated into the development of the ALIAS platform. To provide technical solutions that are tailored to the requirements of the user groups a close cooperation in the overall project is necessary. That means the research teams also learn from the feedback of users. It is important, that the issues of the project are an inherent part in the work with elderly, of the interdisciplinary work between the teams in the project and also part of the engineering education, because the experiences and the results of ALIAS integrated in the engineering education. At the SEFI conference the very early involvement of different user groups in the development process and the results of the conducted inquiries as well as the technical implementation of the mobile robot platform should be highlighted and discussed with the conference attendees.","Adaptable Ambient Living ASsistant; Elder-care; Robot platform; User inclusion","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Mobile robots; Product development; Robots; Technology transfer; Adaptable Ambient Living ASsistant; Elder care; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Interdisciplinary cooperations; Interdisciplinary work; Mobile robot platforms; Robot platform; Technical implementation; Engineering education","Gaßner, K., Conrad, M., (2010) ICT Enabled Independent Living for Elderly.

In this study we focus on inequality of pay and career-development in the field of engineering. Numerous explanations for this have been proposed, for example: - Women are more risk averse than men. [1] - Women are less effective than men in competitive environments, even if they are able to perform similarly in noncompetitive environments. [2] - Women's negotiation skills are worse than those of their male peers'. [3] - Women's delegation skills are worse than those of their male peers'. [4] - Impact of children (family leaves, less working hours). In this research, we study the early career paths of engineering students who graduated from our university in 2005. The questionnaire included 38 questions, which consisted of multiple choice, likert scale and open ended questions. The questionnaire was divided into five sections: education and work history, situation at the time of graduation, first job after graduation, current situation and the significance of university education. As a result of our study, the analyzed data of our university showed, gender, as the dominant factor. The uneven career development can be seen in the progress of monthly salary: Five years after graduation, male engineers' monthly gross salary (regular allowances, tax value of benefits in kind and overtime pays includes) was 4273 euros, while female engineers' salary (similarly counted) was 3784 euros. At that point 20 % of male engineers' had gained a managerial position, compared only 6 % women peers. 45 % of female engineers had been in a family leave during the first five years of their careers. On the other hand 28 % of male engineers had been on a parental leave. What we consider more important is the length of these leaves: 69 % of female engineers were more than a year absent from work, whereas 5 % of their male peers had more than one year parental leave. In the light of our study, we state that women's careers end up being worse than their male peers as their career trajectories aim lower right from the start. Male engineers get better contracts, more responsibilities and more salary. The family leaves are the most controversial question considering female engineers' early career development. In the light of our research, we conclude that the point after getting a first permanent job and achieving economic stability seems to be a good time to start a family. However, according to our research this comes with a cost as female engineers' family leaves are substantially longer leaving them more in charge of children and home, which has detrimental impact on their overall career development. To tackle this problem, we identified certain educational methods to empower women and to support their career development, for example interactive teaching methods.","Career path; Gender","Compensation (personnel); Education; Employment; Engineering education; Engineering research; Engineers; Surveys; Wages; Career development; Career paths; Competitive environment; Current situation; Economic stability; Gender; Open-ended questions; University education; Professional aspects","Blau, F.D., Kahn, L.M., Gender differences in pay (2000) The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 14 (4), pp. 75-99; Gneezy, U., Niederle, M., Rustichini, A., Performance in competitive environments: Gender differences (2003) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118 (3), pp. 1049-1074; Croson, R., Gneezy, U., Gender differences in preferences (2009) Journal of Economic Literature, 47 (2), pp. 448-474; Statistics Finland, http://www.stat.fi/index_en.html; United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, http://www.bls.gov/http://www.bls.gov/fls/flscomparelf/labor_force.htm#table3_2; Kay, H.H., From the second sex to the joint venture: An overview of womens' rights and family law in the United States during the twentieth century (2000) California Law Review, 88 (6), pp. 2017-2093. , December; English, A., Hartmann, H., Hayes, J., Are women now half the labor force?

The emphasis of teaching development is on providing opportunities for deep learning via problem solving and teamwork, which nurture abilities to work in a solution oriented context and transfer theory to practice, to work analytically and systematically and the ability to be creative and innovative in solving professional tasks. Clearly, such outcomes are difficult or perhaps even impossible to achieve by teaching in the classroom or via the traditional laboratory approach. On the other hand, the focus of new avenues for learning in the biosciences has mostly been concerned with changing the way that scientific theory is taught in the classroom, with laboratory experimentation receiving less attention. Moreover, authenticity in laboratory courses is often considered to be self-evident as students work with real samples and real data using disciplinary specialist methodologies. A project-based approach was adopted to a M.Sc. level microbiology laboratory course in a Chemical Technology degree program.. The course spanned 7 weeks at 5 ECTS with the requirements of planning (30h) and executing (40h) a microbiology project, a final report and a seminar presentation (12h) and 53h hours allocated for independent work (writing reports, reading and searching for literature). The goals were for students to be able to 1) design and execute a laboratory project and interpret scientific results in accordance to accepted theory and methodologies of the discipline, 2) experience a research science approach and develop critical thinking skills 3) take responsibility for and to contribute to carrying out experimental work in a group. Three research questions were formulated to evaluate the learning outcomes of the students, the ability of previous laboratory classes to support a constructive learning process, and the constraints and opportunities for implementation of project based laboratory courses in single specialist subjects within an engineering curriculum. RQ1. What are the key learning outcomes of a project-based laboratory course in a microbiology within an engineering degree program ? RQ2. What are the critical thinking skills and previous disciplinary competencies which support the ability of students to independently plan and carry out real-life microbiology experiments ? RQ 3: Can project - based learning be carried out to support desired learning outcomes in an individual specialized subject in a traditional engineering curriculum Student learning outcomes demonstrated that the development of new skills and competencies and the ability to critically evaluate different options were supported by the project-based approach. In addition, students also faced the frustration and uncertainties that are ingrained into scientific research, but as the projects proceeded students began to appreciate the nature of scientific research. However, some students also tended to find it very difficult to adjust to new learning approaches and feel uncomfortable when no ""correct answer"" was available. Moreover, critical thinking skills also emerged, as at the end of the course students were able to reflect on their own decisions during the project and pinpoint the problems in their own planning of the experimentation. The feedback indicates that the students did not view the experimental part of the project as very demanding, which may have caused them to overlook the amount of time that they should have spent on the planning and the detail at which the planning should have been done. On the other hand, it is evident that the disciplinary knowledge gained was rather narrow, and in this course focused primarily on identification of microbes. This is in line with other studies which have shown that there are some concerns as to using project based learning in the biological sciences, as students appear to have difficulty in understanding biological complexity and scientific content. One explanation for the development of somewhat narrow disciplinary knowledge in the present study, could be attributed to the fact that students did not have the time to make mistakes and repeat the experiments which could explain perhaps a shallow constructive process. On the other hand, this may also be due to teaching approach, as project-based learning does emphasize the development of skills, whereas development of disciplinary scientific knowledge does not appear to have been analyzed in comparative studies on project-based learning vs. other teaching approaches.","Bioscience laboratory; Engineering curriculum; Project-based learning","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Laboratories; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Problem solving; Teaching; Critical thinking skills; Engineering curriculum; Microbiology laboratory; Project based learning; Project-based approaches; Scientific researches; Student learning outcomes; Traditional engineerings; Students","Kolmos, A., Holgaard, J., Responses to problem based and project organized learning from industry (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (3), pp. 573-558; Schon, D., (1987) Educating the Reflective Practitioner.

Our survey aimed to examine the adult population's willingness to learn after finishing their formal studies. It also intended to explore the typical learning scenes and learning habits of target groups distinguished on the basis of (academic) qualification, post-secondary education/vocational qualification and working experience, but homogeneous from other aspects. In this study we also inquired the responders about the followings: in what extent does the formal education system help adult learning; in what kind of communicational channels get they familiar with the adult self-training/self-developing opportunities; what do these opportunities aim at and in what extent did they incorporate it into their everyday lives; and what kind of adult learning habits did they develop for themselves. And also how can the different learning format influence the lifestyle and how can it be more effective. The methodology of the research used: to process the analysing methods and the devices of the empirical study, to implement the pilot studies, to analyse the results and observations of the study, to draft the development proposals and recommendations relating to supporting priorities. The applied research-methodological examinations in the survey: in the first phase of the research structured methods were used for exploring and selecting the best international practices, relevant documents and existing resources. The value of this research was to provide professional background to reform the national LLL strategy and provide a decision-preparatory material to draft the state aid policy of non-formal and informal learning. It was also important to suggest recommendations for professional trainings regarding the adaptability of knowledge acquired through non-formal and informal ways. It helped to shape the Budapest University of Technology and Economics classical strategy focusing on the different learning opportunities. This basic research helps to make the teacher and the learner understand how the learning process should be more effective, recognizing the paradigm shift focusing on the different approach of pedagogy to andragogy within the framework of lifelong learning. The overall problem is: what can the institutions of labour- and social policy; the institutions of teaching and educating do for establishing the opportunities, inner and outer conditions for continuous learning? The answer is: more, even more than these institutions themselves would ""think"". As for the solution, the first step is to strengthen the customer relationship management among the staff members. They should develop their diagnostic skills constantly in order to be able to form a picture of the specific person they are dealing with as fast and accurately as it is possible. Our questions concerning participation in formal education/training or other, formally organized education or training were designed to demonstrate how dominant this form of learning is among the varieties of learning methods and what institutional frameworks and contentual destination are required to fulfill its present mission. We can conclude on the importance of learning during adulthood that the majority of those questioned regard it essential. Its main reasons are work and way of life and the general human behaviour that drives people to solve new challenges in the natural and social surroundings. The personal motivation of adult education can be determined by a multitude of factors, including the vivid cultural identity of the individual and the desired one, the lack of necessary school certificates or professions required by the concrete or planned position, available navigational or information channels, necessary language knowledge or information technology, personal ambitions or carrier plans. One of the most important resources of continuous learning is the learning and the methodological culture of learning-promotion. The object rationality is only deceptive and quite often the new techniques and technology are limited by the traditional or instinctively reproduced frameworks. Thus not just the children, but also the adults know a little about successful learning and teaching. They hardly know their learning and teaching styles and they know even less about the arsenal of techniques and methods from which they can select after they have considered the optimality. Due to hierarchical traditions, the ""networkization"" and interactivity as characteristic features of democratic societies spread slowly as it would be favourable. This hinders the establishment of the conditions for continuous learning more than relative poverty. As for an example, let us take a look at the spread of the Internet usage in learning and working as a means of organising professional meetings and conferences, or how extensive the mailing traffic is among the co-workers of the offices of labour management, or the educators and students in order to become more informed and involved in joint problemsolving, or how many people write or read the electronic notice boards, and what is the amount of the received and read newsletters. Recommendations and Suggestions: Change of approach and alteration: mostly, organisational solutions and organisations themselves providing the conditions are in the focus of LLL approach. The enhancement of the LEARNING CITIZEN concept would facilitate to step out from the circle and many areas that so far have not been there could be involved. It requires other kind of ""pedagogy"". Dissemination of knowledge in our mediated world is not enough. EXPERINCE can give impetus and social psychologist should be considered more seriously.","Adult education; Informal-nonformal-formal learning; Lifewide-lifelong learning","Behavioral research; Education; Human resource management; Learning systems; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Public relations; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Teaching; Adult education; Customer relationship management; Formal learning; Institutional framework; Learning and teachings; Life long learning; Postsecondary education; Professional backgrounds; Engineering education","(2005) A Magyar Köztársaság Kormányának Stratégiája Az Egész Életen Át Tartó Tanulásról, , http://www.okm.gov.hu/doc/upload/200511/lll, szeptember; Kálmán, A., (2006) Tanári Szerepek - Tanulási Stílusok (A Felnott-tanulás folyamata), , 119 oldal, OKKER, Budapest; Biggs, J.B., Collis, K.F., (1982) Evaluating the Quality of Learning, the SOLO Taxonomy (Stucture of the Observed Learning Outcome), pp. 8-12. , Academic Press, New York, etc, 24-25., 216; Kálmán, A., (2006) Tanári Szerepek - Tanulási Stílusok (A Felnott-tanulás folyamata), , OKKER, Budapest; Kálmán, A., A lifelong learning aktualitásai - Lifelong learning az Európai Unió oktatáspolitikájában (2006) Fókuszban a Felnottek Tanulása, pp. 95-108. , Szent István Egyetem, Gödöllo; Kálmán, A., Felnottképzési tapasztalatok és lehetoségek a felsooktatás megújításában/ (2008) Adult Education Experiences and Opportunities for the Renewal of Higher Education, 4.

The reasons for this are varied, but tend to focus on misconceptions of the profession as being more suitable for men. In seeking to investigate this issue a participatory research approach was adopted [3] in which two 17 year-old female high school students interviewed twenty high school girls. Questions focused on the girls' perceptions of engineering as a study and career choice. The findings were recorded and analysed using qualitative techniques. The study identified three distinctive 'influences' as being pivotal to girls' perceptions of engineering; pedagogical; social; and, familial. Pedagogical Influences: Pedagogical influences tended to focus on science and maths. In discussing science, the majority of the girls identified biology and chemistry as more 'realistic' whilst physics was perceived to more suitable for boys. The personality of the teacher, and how a particular subject is taught, proved to be important influences shaping opinions. Social Influences: Societal influences were reflected in the girls' career choice with the majority considering medical or social science related careers. Although all of the girls believed engineering to be 'male dominated', none believed that a woman should not be engineer. Familial Influences: Parental influence was identified as key to career and study choice; only two of the girls had discussed engineering with their parents of which only one was being actively encouraged to pursue a career in engineering. Discussion: The study found that one of the most significant barriers to engineering is a lack of awareness. Engineering did not register in the girls' lives, it was not taught in school, and only one had met a female engineer. Building on the study findings, the discussion considers how engineering could be made more attractive to young women. Whilst misconceptions about what an engineer is need to be addressed, other more fundamental pedagogical barriers, such as the need to make physics more attractive to girls and the need to develop the curriculum so as to meet the learning needs of 21st Century students are discussed. By drawing attention to the issues around gender and the barriers to engineering, this paper contributes to current debates in this area - in doing so it provides food for thought about policy and practice in engineering and engineering education.","Barriers; Engineering; Gender; Girls","Curricula; Economic and social effects; Education; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Teaching; Barriers; Gender; Girls; High school students; Parental influence; Participatory research; Perceptions of engineering; Social influence; Professional aspects","BBC, UK trade deficit widens sharply in April (2012) BBC News, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18456161, 15th June 2012., Accessed 16th June 2012; O'Donnell, S., U.

Competence here means the ability to cope with the mathematical challenges students encounter in their study course and later on in professional life. The concept was developed in the Danish KOM project ([2]) and was also used in the famous PISA study [5]. In order to make it more operationable, competence is split up into eight competencies which are: Mathematical thinking, mathematical reasoning, mathematical problem solving, mathematical modeling, handling mathematical symbols and formalism, mathematical representation, mathematical communication and usage of aids and tools. In order to make use of this concept for setting up a concrete curriculum for a study course, one has to specify to which extent these competencies are to be acquired in the study course. In [3], we gave a rough overview how such a specification could be made for a practice-oriented study course in mechanical engineering at a university of applied sciences. In this paper, we investigate the competency of ""mathematical reasoning"" in more detail. This competency comprises the ability to follow and understand mathematical statements and arguments made by others and to set up chains of mathematical argumentation oneself. As in the KOM project we use three so-called dimensions to specify to which extent this competency should be acquired: degree of coverage, radius of action and technical level (for an example concerning the mathematical modeling competency see Blomhoj/Jensen [4]). In the first dimension one has to identify those aspects of the competency that should be covered in the study course (section 1). In the dimension ""radius of action"" the contexts and situations have to be specified in which the competency can be activated (section 2). Finally, the ""technical level"" dimension provides information on how far advanced the mathematical concepts and procedures are which can be used when applying the competency (section 3). We present several example tasks which illustrate how competency could be acquired and used.","Mathematical competence; Mathematical reasoning","Curricula; Engineering education; Mathematical communication; Mathematical competence; Mathematical problem solving; Mathematical reasoning; Mathematical representations; Mathematical statement; Mathematical thinking; University of applied science; Problem solving","SEFI Mathematics Working Group, (2011) A Framework for Mathematics Curricula in Engineering Education, , http://sefi.htw-aalen.de/Curriculum/Competency%20based%20curriculum_discussion_document_December_2011.pdf, Discussion document December 2011, accessed 12/03/23; Niss, M., Højgaard, T., (2011) Competencies and Mathematical Learning.

Universities need to adjust their curricula to current requirements to overcome the global shortage of engineers. TeachING-LearnING.EU supports them in identifying and achieving the necessary steps. The subject center for higher engineering education was founded in 2010 by the three universities RWTH Aachen University, Ruhr University Bochum and TU Dortmund University. Right from the start TeachING-LearnING.EU implemented a funding concept which allows engineering teaching staff to apply for financial support to implement innovative teaching ideas. Each semester, there is a call for ideas. The ideas are evaluated by TeachING-LearnING.EU, and the best applicants receive a funding of up to 30.000 EUR over a period of one year. The money can only be invested in staff costs. By the end of April 2012, 22 innovative teaching projects will have been supported by the Flexible Fund Program. There is investment and benefit for all involved parties. Chairs and Institutes, whose staff receives funding, still need to invest manpower and additional money as the funding regularly does not cover 100% of cost. In addition to financial funding they benefit from competent consulting and sustained improvements in teaching and learning strategies. TeachING-LearnING.EU invests money in funding but the Subject Center's central goal goes beyond financial support: They give the faculties' teaching staff help and advice in didactical questions and - this is the main point - scientifically evaluate the funded ideas. This makes a central contribution to scholarship of teaching within TeachING-LearnING.EU's sphere of activity. The evaluation concept focuses on the impact the funded ideas have on teaching and learning in engineering education. It has three target levels: On the highest level the ideas are evaluated with regards to their contribution to the general goals of TeachING-LearnING.EU, e.g. implementing the shift from teacher centered to student centered courses. On the second level evaluation focuses on the aims of the Flexible Funds concept, e.g. increasing the teaching staff's motivation to experiment with new approaches in teaching. On the most detailed level the ideas are evaluated with regards to their explicit goals and if these are reached. From these first observations we extracted many results and aspects for the new funding phase. Basically all the projects successfully introduced new and mostly student-centred teaching concepts in their courses. Teaching staff showed a high motivation for these changes and realised that depending on the intended learning outcomes group-work or project-work have advantages in comparison to classical lectures. The team of TeachING LearnING.EU will henceforth encourage the staff members to develop evaluation criteria in a manner that students see themselves as co-creators of new teaching environments and have that role in mind when they give feedback. It can be stated that the students' and the teaching staff's feedback addressed all three levels of evaluation. Over all, the results show that we are on the right track in supporting the shift from teaching to learning in engineering education from all points of view. Especially the students approved in the new course concepts a high relation to practical application, a coherent connection of theory and practice, the intensive dialogue between teaching staff and students, and working autonomously on different topics with their teams. For the future possibilities of keeping up the didactical support for the projects even after the period of financial funding need to be considered. This would help to coach the teaching staff more intensively and to support them in keeping up their good work. A future alternative to the financial support would be to provide a different kind of long-term support, such as coaching or workshops on a frequent basis and on relevant topics. Additionally, the moderation and advisory service of TeachING-LearnING.EU as external experts will stay useful for the staff. In order to develop a system of self-renewing study courses (learning curricula) it remains to be seen whether the instrument Flexible Funds should be maintained within the faculty's budget in the future. Thus, a long-term and sustainable incentive for the improvement of teaching could be provided. It will be interesting for TeachING-LearnING.EU to evaluate how strong the impact of the previously funded projects is going to be within their faculty. The goal of triggering a snowball effect could be verified in cycles with short interviews with the former participants on an annual basis.","Evaluation concept; Funding concept; Innovative engineering education","Budget control; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Finance; Motivation; Students; Evaluation concept; Funding concept; Higher engineering educations; Innovative engineering; Intended learning outcomes; Learning in engineering; Student centred teachings; Teaching and learning strategy; Teaching","Bach, U., Jungmann, T., Müller, K., Projektbeschreibung TeachING-LearnING.

This paper outlines the development of an education program for Ph.D. course students to cultivate literacy and competency, in addition to comprising doctoral theses and highlighting the ability to achieve results through innovative research of new themes. The program aims to cultivate fundamental attainment (the fundamentals of natural and social sciences, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology), specialized knowledge (mechanical dynamics, material mechanics, hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and material engineering, as well as a bird's-eye view knowledge of technology, society, and the environment), literacy (language, information literacy, technological literacy, legal knowledge, and ethics), and competency (creativity, problem identification and solution, planning and execution, self-management, teamwork, leadership, a sense of responsibility and duty). The program targets Ph.D. course students in the School of Engineering, which includes Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautics and Astronautics, Precision Engineering, Systems Innovation, Materials Engineering, Applied Chemistry, and Chemical Systems Engineering. The program focuses on (1) Cultivating a bird's-eye-view of the role of engineering in society, (2) Cultivating competitiveness based on international understanding and specialized knowledge, and (3) Cultivating leadership in industry and academia. The corresponding relationship between the educational objectives and the educational program is articulated, as it shows the contribution ratio of the four abilities that can be expected to be cultivated from each program. We instructed the students who enrolled in the program to take a survey with questions inquiring what type of coursework they felt contributed the most to attaining the four educational objectives: fundamental attainment, specialized knowledge, literacy, and competency. Figure 1 compare the ratio of education objectives between faculty setting and students feeling calculated by questionnaire. There are some differences, but overall tendency shows good agreement. We can confirm students feel to get literacy and competency from these education programs. We can change the faculty setting or can change contents of education program according to the student's voice. Also we can change the contribution ratio of four objectives. For example, students feels, Project based learning need fundamental achievement and specialized knowledge. This is because PBL theme is much more realistic engineering theme than the faculty expected. We very thanks to company members offer PBL theme. At this year objectives, we already changed the ratio of PBL. We plan to continue running this program, making continuous improvements in the curriculum based on the opinions of students who participated and industry members who cooperating with education programs. With these continuous improvements in the curriculum, we can foster human resources with multidisciplinary application skills that will actively engage in a wider range of areas.","Competency; Literacy; Ph.D. course student","Birds; Competition; Curricula; Education; Human resource management; Laws and legislation; Personnel; Precision engineering; Professional aspects; Social sciences computing; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Thermodynamics; Competency; Continuous improvements; Curriculum development; Literacy; Manufacturing engineering; Planning and execution; Project based learning; Technological literacy; Engineering education","Yokono, Y., Mitsuishi, M., Education program for Ph.

In times of dynamised markets, qualification demands change more frequently. Identifying the industry qualifications demand on real-time bases becomes therefore an important issue. Job announcements are written carefully to reflect exactly the current qualifications demand whenever a job vacancy appears. Qualifications described in job announcements vary often in their verbal descriptions (syntactics) even though the specific requirements (semantics) may be the same. For a meaningful analysis it is useful to decrease the amount of categories by bringing synonyms together under one qualification description. An automated analysis of job announcements has the potential to be more resource effective and more quickly than a human analysis. Modern information technology offers the chance to identify same semantic by using artificial intelligence. It is based on a model describing the classification of qualification needs. The information technological model - a so-called ontology - aims to be a formal and explicit description of a shared concept about technological qualification. It brings different perspectives on things together by defining its relations and memberships to a class. Therewith machines are enabled to reason. They can transform existing, but implicit, knowledge into explicit one, using so-called first order logic. Such logics using ontologies - the so-called sematic web - enable software applications to interpret heterogeneous information. Semantic Web knowledge bases facilitate precise and unambiguous answers in web queries. The volume and diversity of information can be used more efficiently, and knowledge can be better distributed due to the creation of a vast global knowledge base. New information can be gained through reasoning and used in knowledge intensive applications, such as analyses of job announcements regarding their qualification demands. In this paper, more than one thousand job announcements have been analyzed to determine the real-time job market qualifications demand for the manufacturing engineering. For a precise analysis, custom software has been programmed, this software is cumulatively learning by analyzing each job announcements, the ontology and its application on a big database with many entities representing qualification statements is presented. The ontology was modeled with the open source software protégé, the database is created using a Microsoft Access databases. The education system can be viewed as a production system. The student entered the system as an input, shaped by several teaching activities, at the end of study period student graduated as an output of the system. The graduated student as an output of the education system should satisfy the demand of the customer. The customer in this case is the industry that is intended to employ the graduate. The educational institution as a supplier of graduate must be aware of the customer qualifications demand, therefore producing a qualified graduate according to these demands. This interaction between educational institutions and industries can be viewed as a chain of suppliers and customers1. Engineering curriculum is mostly divided into three parts: compulsory courses, elective courses, and senior project. Each counted for 45%, 30% and 25% of the total European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) respectively2. The compulsory courses are at the initial stages of the engineering study should follow the push strategy. Latter at the senior level stage, the student must be aware of the industry-oriented qualifications demand. Hence, choose the courses that will qualify them for their intended job position, this follows the pull strategy. Further, senior project is a good opportunity for students to be more specialized in specific area of work and to enhance the communication and teamwork skills. In any industry whenever there is a job vacancy or a need for specific skills, they translate these needs into a form of job announcement. Job announcement contains valuable information of the assigned responsibilities, and qualifications needed for specific job position. The main part of the job announcement is the qualifications demand; if the applicants satisfy these demands, they will have a high chance of getting the job. Job announcements can be considered as the voice of the industries, which reflect their current qualifications demand. Industries are continuously updating these data according to their real-time demands. The analysis of job announcements will provide valuable information about the current qualifications demand. Training/teaching individual based on the latest job market demand will help to better-fit individuals to the industry demand. Semantic web technology can help in creating such intelligent system, hence reducing the gap between the job market and the educational institutions by preparing work-ready graduates. This system will be able to collect and analyse the job market qualifications demand in real-time, and proposing these demands in term of qualifications to the educational institutions for preparing the courses and curriculum. Humans understand the semantics of the published texts in the job announcements in term of qualifications needed, and responsibilities assigned for the stated job position. The Semantic Web is an extension of the existing WWW. It intends to bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages. Ontologies represent the structure of the knowledge base in a defined model3. Entities of knowledge are stored based on the ontology structure in a so-called semantic web knowledge base. The ontology model is based on a vocabulary empirically developed out by analyzing around 1100 job announcements for job titled manufacturing engineer. The data have been collected from the period 01.02.2011 to 30.04.2011. The sources of these data were several job search engine like Monster (www.monster.com), Jobsearch (www.jobsearch.co.uk), and Bayt (www.bayt.com). A customized software application has been programed for analyzing the job announcements and determining the job market qualifications demand. The qualifications and its defined vocabulary were formalized as ontology and enriched with a knowledge base, with various relations between qualification statements.","Curriculum; Job announcements; Ontology; Qualifications; Semantic Web","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer aided software engineering; Curricula; Customer satisfaction; Database systems; Education; Education computing; Employment; Engineering education; Formal logic; Intelligent systems; Knowledge based systems; Manufacture; Ontology; Open source software; Open systems; Personnel training; Sales; Search engines; Semantic Web; Social networking (online); Societies and institutions; Software engineering; Students; Supply chains; Teaching; Websites; World Wide Web; Educational institutions; Heterogeneous information; Job announcement; Manufacturing engineering; Manufacturing engineers; Microsoft Access database; Modern information technologies; Qualifications; Engineers","Rompelman, O., De Graaff, E., The engineering of engineering education: Curriculum development from a designer's point of view (2006) European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (2), pp. 215-226; Al-Turki, U.M., Stakeholders integration in higher education: Supply chain approach (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (2), pp. 211-219; GPE, (2012) Global Production Engineering - The Master Program of the TU-Berlin, , www.gpe.tu-berlin.de, cited 2012 12.03; Simchi-Levi, D., Kaminsky, P., Simchi-Levi, E., Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts, Strategies, and Case Studies, 22, p. 321. , Irwin/McGraw-Hill series.

This may prove to be a costly trend for future graduates in engineering. Teachers at Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) are attempting to address this by rethinking the way language instruction is delivered. In this paper, a concrete model for CLIL will be presented. Another purpose is to establish what profit mechanical engineering education gains from this model and finally, we also hope to formulate a model for the cost-estimation of these kinds of CLIL applications. For the purposes of the work being done at LUT, the model being adopted is what Coyle et al. (2010) name the A2 model, which focuses on the development of key concepts and learner autonomy [3, p. 18]. What is novel in this approach is that it is typically used with primary level education, whereas tertiary level education usually adopts more sophisticated models operating at advanced higher level of language proficiency in the vehicular (foreign) language. The focus of the CLIL work being done here has a Languages Other Than English(LOTE) approach, using French and German as the vehicular languages. As Coyle et al.(2010) state, they ""⋯believe that CLIL as a promoter of LOTE has yet to reach its potential in the global arena⋯ Pioneering work using a wide range of languages is gaining momentum and making a crucial contribution to developing CLIL pedagogies⋯"" [3, p. 9]. We hope that our work will further contribute to this development. Overall, the results with the first two rounds of the integrated course have been positive. In addition to satisfying principles of meaningful learning, there were other pedagogical benefits that arose, such as the peer support offered during team work by students with a higher proficiency in German. As for the benefits for engineering education, it was clear that through the process of collaborating on materials with the German teacher, the content teacher was better able to access new information in his area of expertise as well. Another interesting thing to note is that there was virtually no difference in the grades awarded in the integrated course compared to the non-integrated course but the dropout rate decreased from five to none by the second round of the integrated course. These results show the possible synergy and the value gained by incorporating languages into the content learning experience.","Content and language integrated learning (CLIL); Mechanical engineering; Motivation","Computational linguistics; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Education; Education computing; Mechanical engineering; Motivation; Teaching; Cost estimations; Gaining momentum; Integrated course; Integrated learning; Language proficiency; Learner autonomies; Learning experiences; University levels; Engineering education","Association of Academic Engineers and Architects in Finland (TEK), (2012) Kysely Tekniikan Alan Vastavalmistuneille: LUT ja Koko Maa 2011, , http://intra.lut.fi/C8/Palauteraportit/Document%20Library/Valmkys%20LUT%20ja%20koko%20maa%20ja%20LUTn%20omat%20kysymykset%202011.pdf, ppt, Accessed on 11 March 2012; Jonassen, D.H., Supporting communities of learners with technology: A vision for integrating technology with learning in schools (1995) Educational Technology, 35 (4), pp. 60-63; Coyle, D., Hood, P., Marsh, D., (2010) CLIL: Content and Language Integrated Learning, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Eurydice, (2006) Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) at Schools in Europe, , Eurydice, Brussels; Llinares, A., Morton, T., Whittaker, R., (2012) The Roles of Language in CLIL, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Finnish National Board of Education, (1999) KIMMOKE-INDIKAATTORIT Tilastoja Kieltenopetuksesta Perusopetuksessa ja Lukioissa Raportti 2 Kieltenopetuksen Monipuolistamis-ja Kehittämishanke 1996-2000, , http://www.oph.fi/download/49157_kimmoke_tilastoja_1999.pdf, pdf, Accessed on 30 May 2012; Official Statistics of Finland (OSF), Subject Choices of Students [e-publication], , http://www.stat.fi/til/ava/2011/01/ava_2011_01_2011-12-14_tie_001_en.html, Subject choices of completers of upper secondary general school education 2011.

A professional bachelor degree focuses on professional training (such as nursing and teaching) and does not grant automatic access to a master's program. The goal of an academic bachelor degree on the other hand is to get all the necessary knowledge and skills to start a master's program. However professional bachelors are not excluded from a master programme, they can start a master programme after succeeding a bridging programme. In this paper we focus on possible differences in values and skills between these two types of master students: the ones who enter the master programme by means of an academic bachelor degree (regular students) and those who got admittance after finishing a bridging programme (bridging students). In practice, the professors experience no differences. Our research reveals a significant difference between the two populations in some aspects. We invested the basic values and perceptions of motives and needs of 150 master students in engineering technology in the University College Lessius in Belgium with the help of Schein's Career Anchors [1]. The results were analysed with the help of an independent t-test. We analysed the scores of 155 master students in engineering technology in the University College Lessius. We selected all the courses with the same focus and defined 6 groups. We computed for each of these groups the mean scores of all the courses belonging to that group. It was our hypothesis that these means were equal for the regular and the bridging students. With the help of an independent t-test we tested these hypotheses. For 7 out of the 8 career anchors we did not measure any significant difference between the two types of students, except the anchor 'general managerial competence (AM)'. Students who entered the master program after a bridging programme seem to be less interested in becoming a manager. The results of the exams reveal that the regular students perform significantly better for theory, 'theory and exercises' and the master thesis. The difference between the mean scores is extremely significant for theory. For the mixed group 'theory and exercises' and the master thesis the differences are significant. This means that the proved differences can be assigned to a difference between the two populations. Laboratory, 'theory and laboratory' and 'project' are working methods focusing on hands-on activities and/or contextualized tasks. We see no significant better results for the bridging students. The mean values of the results of the evaluation are too close to each other. According to the career anchors the bridging students share almost the same values in their professional careers as the regular students, except in one domain: the general managerial competence. This means, according to Schein [1], that these students work in a less general way compared to regular students. Generally, they are not as much focused on analytical thinking, taking decisions, working together, communication and knowledge of human nature. This research also points out that the mean scores of the regular students are significantly better than the results of the bridging students, except for laboratory related and contextualized courses. For the latter there is no statistically measurable difference between the two populations. The opposite result would be very surprising. Bridging students took practical oriented courses during their professional bachelor program. They apparently take profit of this training and are still motivated to focus on more complex practical problems. The reasons for their less good results for theoretical oriented courses and the master thesis are not yet scientifically invested. We can only guess. A possibility is a lack of necessary prior knowledge, a less good study attitude, etc.. When we focus on the four fields (chemistry, electronics-ICT, electromechanics and energy) and make the same analysis but now for the four fields separately, we obtain very different results. May be this will help us to understand the origin of the observed, significant differences between the two populations. This will be published in a future publication. When we started this research the teaching staff was convinced that the study track has no influence on the performance of the masterstudents. This is a logical conclusion since the differences are small. During exams, the history of a student is not mentioned, nor written down. A professor focuses on the specific moment in the specific context. The students of the two groups are mixed and they take the same courses. Extra research is needed in order to find out the possible reasons for these differences. Other variables, such as gender, training at high school, etc. should be taken into account.","Competences; Flexible education","Anchors; Chemical analysis; Education; Employment; Engineering education; Group theory; Managers; Medical education; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Teaching; Analytical thinking; Competences; Electro-mechanics; Flexible education; Hands-on activities; Practical problems; Professional careers; Professional training; Students","Schein, E.H., (2010) Organizational Culture and Leadership, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco","Langie, G.; Vice-dean Faculty of Engineering Technology, KU Leuven LESEC, University College Lessius and KUBelgium",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

Students wishing to pursue professional engineering degree courses are required to demonstrate proficiency in secondary school mathematics at the higher level. Yet, only a 16% minority of secondary school mathematics students in Ireland takes the Leaving Certificate mathematics exam at the higher level. It is widely thought that mathematics is the ""key academic hurdle"" in producing a supply of engineering graduates [1]. While mathematics has been regarded as a fundamental knowledge area underpinning engineering practice there is a belief among some practising engineers that the mathematics they learned is not applicable to their work [2]. Advances in technology, knowledge diffusion and almost instant information access, support the view that teaching ""engineers to think analytically will be more important than helping them memorise algebra theorems"" [3]. However, research concerning the type of mathematics used by engineers in their work is sparse [2,4]. This research was inspired by the observation that there is a lacuna in the literature concerning the nature of mathematics' role, if any, as a significant cause of the declining number of students entering professional engineering education courses. Additionally there is currently no broad picture of the mathematical expertise required or used by practising engineers. This study investigates (i) the role of mathematics in engineering practice and (ii) whether there is a relationship between students' experiences with school mathematics and their choice of engineering as a career. The population of interest in this study is professional engineers practising in Ireland. A sequential explanatory mixed methods design, where the subsequent collection and analysis of interview data builds on the analysis of survey findings, is employed. Practising engineers' mathematics usage is considered in three parts, namely curriculum mathematics, mathematical thinking, and motivation to take a mathematical approach. Curriculum mathematicsusage is measured by a derivation of de Lange's mathematics assessment pyramid [5]. Mathematical thinkingusage relates to mathematical modes of thinking used in work. Motivation to take a mathematical approach concerns the affective domain whereby it is believed that attitudes, beliefs, values and emotions play a central role in mathematics learning [6]. Engineers' experiences of school mathematics and the impact of their feelings about mathematics on their choice of engineering careers are also investigated. The findings show that (i) engineers' feelings about mathematics are a major influence on their choice of engineering as a career; (ii) teachers, affective factors and sociocultural influences are the main contributors to engineers' interest in and learning of mathematics; (iii) while almost two thirds of engineers use high level curriculum mathematicsin engineering practice, mathematical thinking has a greater relevance to engineers' work compared to curriculum mathematics;(iv) professional engineers' curriculum mathematicsusage is dependent on the interaction of engineering discipline and engineering role, their mathematical thinkingusage is independent of engineering discipline and engineering role; (v) engineers show high affective engagement with mathematics and their usage of mathematics in engineering practice is influenced by the value given to mathematics within their organisation; and (vi) the focus on ""objective"" solutions at the expense of tacit knowledge in mathematics education reduces the value of mathematics in engineering practice.","Affect; Engineering careers; Engineering practice; Mathematics usage","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Engineers; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Affect; Engineering careers; Engineering disciplines; Engineering practices; Leaving Certificate mathematics; Mathematical thinking; Mathematics assessments; Professional engineerings; Professional aspects","National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine, (2010) Rising Above the Gathering Storm Revisited: Rapidly Approaching Category 5, , The National Academies Press, Washington, D.

The political elite in Europe in collaboration with the industry has adopted the Anglo-Saxons' model of the split three years Bachelor degree and one two years Master degree. However, the Academic community in full agreement with the Engineers Professional organizations seems convinced that the best Engineering education should be based on an integral five years curriculum, considering the adopted model as leading to dispensable young Scientists. The weakness of this latter thesis is that most five years Engineering undergraduate programmes include at least one year (usually three semesters) of specialization. One could claim that this makes the curricula somehow split into two circles, hence similar to the accepted Bachelor-Master approach. The argument against this view is that the ""integral five years"" path can be setup in a more controllable way so that the specialization is build on rigid bases. To these different point of views must one should add the recently realized necessity of the required ""Convergence of Engineering, Physical and Health Sciences"" in order for engineers to advance the technology beyond the current borders and especially regarding novel diagnostic - therapeutic techniques and health services, [1]. Besides that it is now a common understanding that a modern engineer must establish a rigid theoretical background and not just a restricted knowledge specialization, so that he/she will be able to adapt to the fast varying of technical environment with a high rate of newly introduced plethora of specializations. In view of the above, the question is whether the newly reformed Electrical & Computer Engineering in Greece are able to successively respond to these challenges. If they can't what are the reasons, is it possible to overcome the obstacles and how? If we do accept that a rigid theoretical background is necessary, what will be the content of the corresponding mandatory curriculum? If we do agree that ""an integral five years engineering education"" is needed, what are the means to be used for convincing the political elite and the industry representatives? The above questions constitute a serious problems and they cannot be addressed in a single paper. The intend of the Author is to systematically put down the questions in some logical order and the ambition is directed toward addressing some of them from his own point of view and experience. A wide consensus of the Engineering community and boards is observed in regard to reforming engineering curriculum toward: i) De-emphasize narrow disciplinary approaches and strengthen thought along inter-disciplinary lines. Utilize a problem - solving approach to support this task. ii) Retain and possibly strengthen a solid basic engineering knowledge. The report [5] even suggests the adoption of a 4 years core courses plus 1 year specialization in the integral 5 years professional (M. Eng.) degree. iii) Educate engineers to work better in groups and the best way is through the problem solving based learning. iv) More emphasis should be put on design and not to be restricted in the analysis. Namely, to strengthen the students hands-on engineering experience as ""design-build-operate"". This means not only to enhance the laboratory exercises but to carefully select problems from the real world-industry applications within the PBL approach. v) To include courses on economics, marketing and management in the curriculum, which will improve engineers employability but also strengthen their skills toward solving interdisciplinary problems and improve communication when working in teams. vi) Prepare engineers to act as policy makers and leaders by including courses on Ethics and public policy, [6]. These courses may contribute to the realization of legal and moral responsibility of Engineers in their professional practice. vii) According to [5] try to ""Infuse more professional content into existing engineering programmes"". This is already adopted by MIT and Stanford through the appointment of Engineers with distinguished carriers in industry as ""Professors of Practice"". viii) Prepare engineers for lifelong learning or one could say ""teach them how to learn and they will carry on to acquire more knowledge than their educators"". Keeping in mind the above and using them as guidelines, we will try to suggest the first steps of the required undergraduate curriculum reforms. It is widely realized that engineering education faces a substantial change trying to address the economy globalization as well as the interdisciplinary sciences convergence. Solid engineering education must be retained, while during their education they must acquire hands-on experience in ""design-build-operate"" through projects. Additionally, engineers must be prepared to become leaders and policy makers thus they should have knowledge of basic economic, marketing and managerial topics enriching their ""soft-skills"" or communication abilities. Some first steps toward enhancing the Greek EECE curriculum have been proposed herein for both core and specialization courses. Two are the major challenges, to include projectbased learning through the entire curriculum and to adopt a number (14) flows - flows in the specialization able to support the evolving convergence of sciences but before all to support the engineering diploma equivalence to a Master of Engineering degree. Finally, a cooperation call is addressed to all colleagues and in particular to SEFI leadership to support our claim to Greek government and the European Union for a recognition of all integrated systems engineering diplomas as equivalent to a Master of Engineering (M. Eng.), provided that they have undergone the appropriate accreditation.","Convergence of scientific disciplines; Rigid background versus specialization","Accreditation; Commerce; Curricula; Decision making; Economics; Education; Education computing; Engineers; Human resource management; Marketing; Model buildings; Problem solving; Professional aspects; Public policy; Teaching; Computer engineering education; Engineering undergraduates; Industry representatives; Problem-solving based learning; Professional organization; Rigid background versus specialization; Scientific discipline; Undergraduate curriculum reform; Engineering education","MIT white Paper, The Convergence of the Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Engineering, , www.cimit.org/.../MIT-White-Paper-on; Duran, M., Aguado, J., De La Torre, S., Martin, S., An Interactive Project - Based Learning Teaching Methodology in Electrical Engineering Courses; Vests, C.M., (1995) U.

An important task of this new Agency was to support research and development collaboration between universities and other research institutions, on the one hand, and industrial companies (including small and medium-size enterprises), on the other. This decision has been incorporated into the legislation of the Czech Republic [2]. Grant-funded programmes of the Technology agency are: • The ALFA programme, which supports applied research and development in progressive technologies, materials and systems, power sources and the environment, including sustainable transportation. It is accessible both for research institutions and for private companies, with a preference for joint projects between these two groups. This means that it is very suitable for establishing and financing collaboration between engineering universities and industry on individual projects. • The BETA programme, which is aimed at the needs of public administration bodies, i.e., ministries and other state institutions (Czech Mining Office, State Office for Nuclear Safety, etc.) The topics are selected and ordered by these institutions. Universities can participate in this programme, but there is limited freedom in the choice of methods, and the projects must be oriented toward a goal that has been determined a priori. • The OMEGA programme, which supports research and development in the applied social sciences, and is therefore more useful for ""classical"" universities than for research and collaboration in engineering sciences (however, some IT technologies, software production, etc., can also be included). • The Competence Centres programme, which provides support not for individual projects, but for long-term collaboration between the public sector and the private sector. There must be a minimum of three enterprises and one research institution, but the consortia usually consist of a larger number of participants. The centres may be distributed, i.e., they need not necessarily be ""under one roof"", and they may be located on the premises of partner institutions. The system is required to be self-sustainable; the centres should continuously generate further research questions and issues in their field of activity, solve problems and apply solutions in practical applications. An important component of the programme is mobility of researchers, especially early-stage researchers, between academia and industry. Due to lack of funding for Czech higher education, the technical universities have shown extraordinary interest especially in the ALFA programme and in the Competence Centres programme, which are the most suitable for engineering research. The most frequent participants are, needless to say, the two most important technical universities in the country, i.e., the Czech Technical University in Prague and the Technical University in Brno, but regional universities that also provide engineering education, e.g. in Liberec, Plzeň and Ostrava, are also well represented. The main problems: • Though the total funding distributed by the Technology Agency may seem to be a great amount, it still does not meet the needs of the Czech academic community and industrial capacities. • Unambiguous conditions for applications. The effort to give access to all types of participants has led to very complicated project structures and project documentation, lengthy instructions, not always clear and straightforward. It was therefore not always easy to fulfil the formal requirements, and as a result a considerable number of projects were disqualified. The Presidium, the Office and the Supervisory Board of the Agency are now making a concerted effort to clean up the rules, simplify them, and thus eliminate similar problems and make the administrative procedures smoother in the future. • Each project was reviewed by at least two reviewers, selected at random from the database of specialists in fields close to the topic of the project. This scheme, on the one hand, prevents undesirable influence on the reviewers; on the other hand, the reviewer's field of specialisation is not necessarily very close to the topic of the application. The establishment and operation of the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic as the analogue for applied research to the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic was initially received by the universities, and especially by the technical universities, as a positive step toward a simpler and better funding system for applied research and development. However, some initial problems with this institution have led to lowered confidence in the usefulness of this innovation. Improving the system step-by-step and learning from previous experience can rebuild confidence in the Agency. It can clearly make a contribution to closer and firmer collaboration between the universities and industry. However, it is still too early to draw responsible conclusions about its ability to shift Czech industry toward high technologies, and to improve the competitiveness of the country in the international market.","Company; Projects; Technical University; Technology Agency","Competition; Data mining; Education; Engineering education; Finance; Industrial research; Industry; International trade; Materials handling; Problem solving; Public administration; Research and development management; Social sciences computing; Administrative procedures; Engineering universities; International markets; Projects; Research and development; Small and medium-size enterprise; Sustainable transportation; Technical universities; Societies and institutions","Musílek, L., Engineering education, university research and companies (2001) SEFI Annual Conference 2001: New Engineering Competencies - Changing the Paradigm, Copenhagen (Denmark) 12-14 September 2001, Proceedings, p. 29. , Copenhagen, DTU; http://www.tacr.cz, Web page:, mostly in Czech, some basic information also in English; (2009) Act No. 130/2002 Coll. on Support for Research, Experimental Development and Innovation, Establishment of the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic Took Effect on July 1","Musílek, L.; Department of Experimental Physics, Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical EngineeringCzech Republic",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

The change includes integrating education about sustainability into existing engineering education, introducing a field of disciplines that specializes in sustainability and establishing engineering research on sustainability [1]. At the early phase of this research, the stand-alone and the integrated models were presented as strategies in introducing of sustainability courses in engineering education. Later, the models were further developed conceptually in three dimensions which include approaches and orientations [2]. This concept of characterizing courses confirmed the existence of other kind of courses which were poorly structured and less effective. The existence of these courses motivated this researcher to study the effectiveness of courses for sustainability in engineering education. The main expected outcome of the research is to design a framework that will integrate sustainability in engineering curricula. Subsequently, the framework will provides course developers with important elements to integrate sustainability in designing a course. Furthermore, the framework also will offers course developers structured design procedures and inspires developers with the positive effects of the teaching methods. To achieve the research outcomes, several real experiences and effective courses will be evaluated and analyzed, and the results then will be presented as the design procedures and exemplary teaching methods. A mixed methods design was employed to obtain data from a group of course developers, teachers and students. A part of this study, qualitative data are viable in addressing research problems in which interview transcripts and observation reflections can ascertain the process of developing the courses. Document analyses also are very helpful in providing important inputs. In the other part of this study, quantitative data are feasible to address research problems such as to determine the effectiveness of the courses. The combination of qualitative and quantitative data provides a thorough understanding in addressing research problems, in particular to provide complementary qualitative data if quantitative data are inadequate [3]. The research model was developed by adapting the basic cycle of design, investigate-plan-develop-evaluate, and will be used as overall research model. The cycle of the research model consists of four phases which includes qualitative and quantitative research methods. For phase one, the framework for course design was developed by reviewing sustainability courses across continents and collecting real practice feedbacks from experts and practitioners in sustainability. Outcomes from the phase one will serve as a base in developing instruments for the next phase. Two of the phases, phase two and phase three, will be focused on developing the framework for course design. Two case studies will be conducted at the phase two. It is expected that the in-depth case studies research will be able to point out the potential variables used to develop evaluation tools and indicator as well as to redesign the framework. The phase three is the non-experimental research approaches. At this phase, effectiveness of five selected sustainability courses will be evaluated and indicated. Three types of evaluation tools to evaluate the effectiveness of sustainability courses were identified. The evaluation tools will use numerical values for evaluating the students' learning outcomes in term of knowledge, skills and attitudes. This non-experimental approach intended to evaluate the offered sustainability course without intervention on existing course design. Therefore, the real practices can be justified and be the solutions of the main research question, which is to construct effective frameworks of course design. The final phase is set in place to conduct validity tests on the proposed frameworks of course design. The proposed frameworks are used to develop an effective sustainability for both types of course structure. Two groups of course designers were assigned for the tests. The outcomes of the tests are feedbacks on the framework design.","Research methods; Sustainability in engineering education","Design; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Sustainable development; Document analysis; Engineering curriculum; Experimental approaches; Experimental research; Integrate sustainability; Integrated models; Quantitative research methods; Research questions; Teaching","Arsat, M., Holgaard, J., De Graaff, E., Three dimensions of characterizing courses for sustainability in engineering education: Models approaches and orientations (2011) 2011 3rd International Congress on Engineering Education, , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Arsat, M., Holgaard, J., De Graaff, E., Stand-alone and interdisciplinary course design for Engineering Education for Sustainable Developemt (2011) 1st World Engineering Education Flash Week, , Jorge Bernardino and Jose Carlos Quadrado, Lisbon, Portugal; Creswell, J., Clark, V., (2007) Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, pp. 31-35. , Sage Publication Inc., Thousand Oak; Andrews, K.E., Tressier, K.D., Minttzer, J.J., Assessing environmental understanding: An application of the concept mapping strategy (2008) Environmental Education Research, 14 (5), pp. 519-536; Lourdel, N., Grondran, N., Laforest, V., Debray, B., Brodhag, C., Sustainable Development cognitive map: A new method of evaluating student understanding (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8 (2), pp. 170-182","Arsat, M.; Faculty of Education, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

However, the number of science and technology graduates is not increasing fast enough to keep up with demand from industry and academia [3] and therefore, recruiting students to STEM programmes is seen as a major problem in most European countries [4]. The ATTRACT research project ""Enhance the Attractiveness of Studies in Science and Technology"", has emerged to meet these challenges and it aims at increasing the knowledge of different aspects of student recruitment to STEM education and understanding how students' retention in these areas can be improved (see [5] for detailed information about the project). This paper reports on first-hand Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) results, as part of WP7 research, which chiefly focuses on how to attract students to STEM programmes. The study involved the comparison of 583 secondary students and 1796 IST freshmen students' background and perceptions on three key areas: parental background, motivation to undertake a university programme and perceptions of engineering studies and profession. In addition, it was compared how those students perceive other professions in terms of difficulty of the profession, effort required to undertake the programme, pay level and employers' recognition, since knowing how these perceptions diverge may shed some light on new approaches to attract students to STEM programmes. Key findings from the two surveys reveal that typically, engineering students are more likely to have at least one of the parents who have studied engineering or teaching. Notice however that IST students might not distinguish clearly between an engineering background and a teaching background when parents teach at an engineering institution. Either way, this could provide an exposure to engineering that could influence students' career path [6]. In most aspects both secondary and IST students have similar reasons to choose the programmes and universities. However, engineers' importance to the country development is perceived differently, while most of the engineering students believe that engineers play a very important role in country's development (72%), only around 30% of the secondary students seem to share this view. Moreover, IST freshmen perceive engineering as being much more difficult to perform, as well as requiring much more effort to undertake the programme, than secondary students. Likewise, they believe that the pay level and the employers' recognition are better than secondary students do. Results and outputs among secondary and freshmen students point out that there is a misalignment between their perceptions. A strategy to recruit more students to the engineering field should benefit from an alignment of secondary students perceptions. This paper brings contributions relevant at different levels, namely to academic discussion on the topic, to higher education organization management and also to help guiding policy making and design of specific public policies aimed at attracting more students to STEM programmes.","Engineering education; Stem studies; Student interests; Student perceptions","Education; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Public policy; Engineering institutions; Level of innovation; Perceptions of engineering; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Science and Technology; Stem studies; Student perceptions; Student recruitment; Students","Bøe, M.V., Henriksen, E.K., Lyons, T., Schreiner, C., Participation in science and technology: Young people's achievement-related choices in late modern societies (2011) Studies in Science Education, 47 (1), pp. 37-72; EU, (2010) A European Strategy for Smart, Sustainable, and Inclusive Growth, , European Commission, Brussels; OECD, (2006) Changing Supply and Demand for S&T Professionals in a Globalised Economy, , OECD Publishing; EU, (2004) Europe Needs More Scientists!, European Commission, Directorate-General for Research, High Level Group on Human Resources for Science and Technology in Europe, , Brussels; Hanson, M., Engström, E., Kairamo, A., Varano, M., Enhance the attractiveness of studies in science and technology (2010) Joint International IGIP-SEFI Annual Conference, , IGIP-SEFI, Trnava, Slovakia; Whiston, S.C., Keller, B.K., The influences of the family of origin on career development: A review and analysis (2004) The Counseling Psychologist, 32 (4), pp. 493-568; Bandura, A., Barbaranelli, C., Caprara, G.V., Pastorelli, C., Self-efficacy beliefs as shapers of children's aspirations and career trajectories (2001) Child Development, 72 (1), pp. 187-206; Stevens, R., Amos, D., Jocuns, A., Garrison, L., Engineering as lifestyle and a meritocracy of difficulty: Two pervasive beliefs among engineering students and their possible effects (2007) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Honolulu, Hawaii; OECD, (2011) Education at a Glance 2011: OECD Indicators, , OECD Publishing; Mena, I.B., Diefes-Dux, H.A., First-year engineering students' portrayal of engineering in a proposed museum exhibit for middle school students (2012) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 21 (2), pp. 304-316; Metz, S., It takes a village to change the perception of engineering (2007) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Honolulu, Hawaii; GEPE, (2011) Estatísticas da Educação 2009/2010, , Gabinete de Estatística e Planeamento da Educação","Reis, A.; Núcleo de Estatística e Prospectiva, Instituto Superior TécnicoPortugal",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

While documenting knowledge for professionals (e.g., reference manuals, user guides, etc.) may be considered a straightforward procedure, the authoring of a book that is intended for engineering students is certainly much more complicated. It is widely accepted that the information provided in a book should help readers understand the main ideas easily. In consideration of the engineering books it is also important to help readers identify what should be the focus of their attention, in order to support the application of theory to practice. Moreover, the transfer of knowledge to the undergraduate education of professional engineers, in an age of rapidly advancing technology, should be provided with more flexibility. The question is, how is this possible when the writing of a book could last for years, while in just a few years' time the technology of today will most commonly be obsolete? In this paper the authors share their research experience on the undergraduate engineering education which was initiated in 2004, and concluded in 2011 with the publication of a book that involves microcontroller technology [1]. The authors' research has been primarily focused on the sophomore students of the Department of Informatics & Telecommunications, Epirus Educational Institute of Technology (Greece), in an attempt to reinforce the educational level of the tutees on the software and hardware design issues for embedded computer systems. Through an in-depth examination of the subject matter [2-4], the authors discuss the strategies addressed for surmounting the barriers to effective learning. A comparative discussion on relevant books is addressed, while a generalized working plan towards the authoring of a well-organized book in microcontroller education is also recommended.","Assembly language; Microcontrollers","Computer hardware; Controllers; Education; Embedded systems; Engineers; Knowledge management; Microcontrollers; Students; Assembly language; Educational Institutes; Embedded Computer Systems; Microcontroller education; Microcontroller technology; Rapidly advancing technology; Undergraduate education; Undergraduate engineering educations; Engineering education","Bolanakis, D.E., Glavas, E., Evangelakis, G.A., Kotsis, K.T., Laopoulos, T., (2011) Microcomputer Architecture: Low-level Programming Methods and Applications of the M68HC908GP32 (In Greek), , Contemporary Education, Thessaloniki; Bolanakis, D.E., Evangelakis, G.A., Glavas, E., Kotsis, K.T., A teaching approach for bridging the gap between low-level and higher-level programming using assembly language learning for small microcontrollers (2011) Computer Application in Engineering Education, 19 (3), pp. 525-537; Bolanakis, D.E., Kotsis, K.T., Laopoulos, T., Switching from computer to microcomputer architecture education (2010) European Journal of Engineering Education, 35 (1), pp. 91-98; Bolanakis, D.E., Kotsis, K.T., Laopoulos, T., Arithmetic operations in assembly language: Educators' perspective on endianness learning using 8-bit microcontrollers (2009) Proc. of the IEEE 5th International Workshop on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications, pp. 600-604. , Rende Italy; Bolanakis, D.E., Kotsis, K.T., Laopoulos, T., Teaching concepts in microcontroller education: CISC vs RISC assembly-level programming (2009) Proc. of the International Conference on Information Communication Technologies in Education, pp. 742-750. , Corfu Greece; Bolanakis, D.E., Evangelakis, G.A., Glavas, E., Kotsis, K.T., Teaching the addressing modes of the M68HC08 CPU by means of a practicable lesson (2008) Proc. of the 11th IASTED International Conference on Computers and Advance Technology in Education, pp. 446-450. , Crete Greece; Bolanakis, D.E., Glavas, E., Evangelakis, G.A., An integrated microcontroller-based tutoring for computer architecture laboratory course (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (4), pp. 785-798; Bolanakis, D.E., Glavas, E., Evangelakis, G.A., A multidisciplinary educational board system for microcontrollers: Considerations in design for technically accurate custom-made platforms (2007) Proc. of the International Symposium on Information Technologies and Applications in Education, pp. 391-395. , Kunming P.

Similarities and differences between the countries are drawn and attention is drawn to the structural differences which make such cross-country comparison difficult. Enrolment trends in many European countries show static or declining numbers of people entering engineering dropped programmes. In order to consider increasing the number of engineering students it is essential to examine the measures that may be excluding potential entrants. This paper presents some of the results of the ATTRACT project, which has examined the formal barriers standing in the way of entry to engineering. Issues relating to prior student achievement both in engineering-relevant subjects and other areas are examined to assess whether or not alternative procedures could be used to admit more, but still highly-qualified, students. Comparisons are made between Ireland and Portugal, countries that share certain similarities in terms of the need to increase engineering graduates, but also significant differences in relation to context. Inevitable complexities arise when comparing complex systems across national boundaries. What may appear to be an identical barrier in two countries is nonetheless operating within an entirely different framework in each. As a result, understanding the implications of existing barriers beyond their particular context, or attempting to infer how a practice from one country may translate to another, can be challenging. The sample in IST (Portugal) study includes 1253 students admitted in that institution in 2004/05 by the national contest for access to higher education. The dimensional axes of analysis were: academic background, socioeconomic status and family capital, motivations/expectations, and contextual factors. The sample in TCD (Ireland) is 1,835 engineering students over ten years (2000-2009 inclusive). The factors analysed were academic achievement in high school, gender, and residential status. Despite significant differences in the structure of the education system in the two countries, there are clear parallels in a number of areas for which similar entrant data was available: • Overall academic achievement is predictive of student progress in both cases, albeit specific subjects are more valuable than the overall aggregate grade in the Irish context. This may simply be an artefact of the relatively free subject choice in the Irish system compared to the more 'tracked' system in Portugal. • Access to high preference choice of course is significant, albeit less so than academic grades, in both countries • Physics confers an advantage on students in both countries with regard to progression There are areas where there is insufficient data overlap between the two countries to effect a direct comparison - these include the socio-economic and family status, the student travel time and the student expectations and motivations. Of the remaining areas where there is data available, there are interesting divergences regarding living at home and gender. Interestingly both of these variables are significant in the Irish/Trinity College context when the entire student cohort (including Arts, Medicine, Business, Law etc) is considered, but not specifically for engineers.","Entrance mechanisms; Recruitment; Retention; Student performance","Education; Engineering education; Motivation; Travel time; Academic achievements; Alternative procedures; Engineering graduates; Recruitment; Retention; Socio-economic status; Structural differences; Student performance; Students","OECD, (2006) Changing Supply and Demand for S&T Professionals in a Globalised Economy, , OECD Publishing; Irish Academy of Engineering, (2005) Engineering a Knowledge Island 2020, , Engineers Ireland, Dublin; Smith, J.P., Naylor, R.A., Dropping out of university: A statistical analysis of the probability of withdrawal for U.

By 2008 the TU Berlin completed the transformation of its entire syllabus into a Bachelor/Master degree system that fits to the European Higher Education Area. The challenge of the forthcoming years is imposed by social change in Germany: a rising number of students entering universities in the next years, an increasing heterogeneity arising from the different educational and biographical backgrounds of students and a shortage of qualified employees at the labour market. With regard to this frame conditions the Federal Ministry of Education and Research released the third pillar of the federal Higher Education Pact [1]. In this frame, the TU Berlin applied for and got 10.5 Million £ funding. The university will use the money for implementing a bunch of measures that will foster teaching and education in engineering and natural sciences in the following five years. In 2012 the TU Berlin initiated the program ""First class for our students"" in order to improve the conditions of studying and teaching. Common to all measures the TU Berlin is the focus, first, on the undergraduate studies, in particular on the first-year students and, second, on the so-called MINT - subjects, that i.e. Mathematics, Informatics, Natural sciences and Technical subjects (e.g. engineering). The overall aim of the project is to enhance the culture of teaching and learning. The program supports a better academic staffing for all status groups (student tutors, academic members of the staff and full professors) as well as measures for didactic qualifications and counseling. The following picture summarizes the eight subprojects: Clearly, the improvement of quality in teaching and studying is a multidimensional task that needs to put on at various levels within a university. Therefore, the eight subprojects involve different status groups across all faculties and the central administration. In order to maximize the effect of so far local projects all personnel measures are linked to measures of further qualification, supervision or counseling.","Culture of teaching; Incentive model for better teaching; Propaedeutic study program","Education; Education computing; Employment; Engineering education; Natural sciences; Teaching; Education in engineerings; European Higher Education Area; First year students; Incentive models; Ministry of Education; Propaedeutic study program; Teaching and learning; Undergraduate study; Students","(2012) Higher Education Pact of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, , http://www.bmbf.de/en/6142, Qualitätspakt Lehre: http://www.bmbf.de/de/15375.php 08.06; Heublein, U., Hutsch, C., Schreiber, J., Sommer, D., Besuch, G., (2009) Ursachen des Studienabbruchs in Bachelor- und in Herkömmlichen Studiengängen, , HIS-Projekt; Heublein, U., Hutsch, C., Schreiber, J., Sommer, D., Besuch, G., (2009) Ursachen des Studienabbruchs in Bachelor- und in Herkömmlichen Studiengängen, p. 47. , HIS-Projekt; Heublein, U., Hutsch, C., Schreiber, J., Sommer, D., Besuch, G., (2009) Ursachen des Studienabbruchs in Bachelor- und in Herkömmlichen Studiengängen, p. 8. , HIS-Projekt; Heublein, U., Richter, J., Schmelzer, R., Sommer, D., (2012) Die Entwicklung der Schwund- und Studienabbruchquoten an den Deutschen Hochschulen.

To some extent, the interpretation of ESD depends on the context and it is set out from real practical problems. It is also claimed that its principles should not only be integrated in the curriculum but be also part of the vision of the educational system. Core theories define and characterize ESD as: (i) rooted in postmodernism; (ii) social, constructivist and transformative; (iii) contextual, experimental and collaborative; (iv) process oriented and empowering; (v) problem solving, critical thinking and creative; etc. The characteristics and definition of ESD move from an epistemological perspective to a curriculum construction perspective. Broadly there is an alignment between the ESD core theories and the EESD literature, however these reports don't have a clear interpretation of competencies and how can be frame into practice (e.g. learning approaches). One of the main challenges regarding to EESD is to move from broad interpretations of its principles and descriptive examples for more common conceptual framework. This paper aims to present a qualification framework based on the analysis of education for sustainable development (ESD) theories and engineering education for sustainable development (EESD) and bring together common understanding of the concepts and principles used in their discourses. The research question underlying this study was: if there is a common qualification framework (knowledge and competencies) in education for sustainable development (ESD) and in engineering education for sustainable development (EESD)? 1. METHODOLOGY The Declaration of Barcelona,The Global Engineer, and Engineering for Sustainable Development: Guiding Principleswere analysed through content analysis. The literature review presented three main common points of ESD and EESD: i) sustainable development main themes; ii) learning approach, and iii) learning objectives. The units for analysis were cluster according to these three main common points (named criteria), which also addressed three dimensions of curriculum (Table 1). Table 1. Category and units of analysis The sustainable development indicators are based on the Global Report Initiatives (GRI), which main goal is to ""communicate clearly and openly about sustainability"", and is defined as ""a globally shared framework of concepts, consistent language, and metrics required"" for reporting sustainability at an organizational level. The general learning objectives and the learning approach characteristics were based on ESD core theories. 2. REFLECTIONS In general, the documents analysed enclosure aspects of the three dimensions of sustainable development and argue for them with examples of engineering practices, stressing the central role of engineering and the alignment of the discipline specific knowledge with others disciplines aiming a responsible and conscience action. Also the competences needed to achieve sustainable actions are common to the three documents, and are aligned with ESD core theories as well as the characteristics of the learning approach. This study provided an instrument for meta-analysis in three interconnected axis for EESD: i) sustainable development themes/aspects to address; ii) general learning objectives (competences and skills); iii) characteristics of the learning approach. This framework encloses a conceptual dimension and methodological framework. The conceptual dimension is related with the common understanding between different types of literature in relation with EESD qualification framework. Methodologically, the framework can be used as an instrument for analysis and change.","Engineering education for sustainable development; Qualification framework","Curricula; Education; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Planning; Problem solving; Sustainable development; Conceptual frameworks; Curriculum constructions; Education for sustainable development; Engineering Education for Sustainable Development(EESD); Engineering practices; Methodological frameworks; Qualification framework; Sustainable development indicators; Engineering education","Corcoran, P., Wals, A., (2005) Higher Education and the Challenge of Sustainability: Problematics, Promise, and Practice, , Kluwer Academic Publishers: New York; UNESCO, (2005) United Nations Decade for Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014): International Implementation Scheme, , http://unescodoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001486/148654e.pdf, Division for the Promotion of Quality Education - UNESCO, Paris, accessed 15 February 2011; Bonnett, M., Education for sustainability as a frame of mind (2002) Environmental Education Research, 8 (1), pp. 9-20; Sterling, S., (2004) Sustainable Education: Re-visioning Learning and Change, , Schumacher Briefing No 6.

Similarly, reports of the close association between communications and management and of the link between managerial communication and employee motivation evidence the affective revolution in working life. [1], [2] The paradigm shift from pure cognitionbased models of organizational behavior towards ones combining cognition and affect is resultative of the understanding that emotions are the key psychological driver of thinking, motivation, and behavior. [3], [4] It has recently been speculated that leaders' social and emotional skills contribute more effectively than their mathematical-logical intelligence to the efficacy of their organizations; some go as far as to claim that leadership is enacted through communication. [5] To verify such claims, quantitative research was conducted in seven industrial organizations. The results corroborate that: 1) Managers who are assertive, emotionally available and inspiring receive higher overall scores for their overall management and leadership skills. This implies that emotionally intelligent managers are also seen as more effective and productive. 2) Mathematical-logical intelligence does not predict positive subordinate perceptions of a manager's leadership ability. 3) Such personality dimensions as sociability correlate positively with subordinate perceptions. 4) A manager's assertion predicts positive subordinate perceptions and helps efficient behavior in the managerial role. 5) Older age is connected with better emotional availability. 6) Managers scoring high in logical ability have a stronger leadership motivation, but leadership motivation does not predict higher subordinate scores. The subsequent demands for a new type of leadership competence that draws not only from substantive and technical expertise but also from personal qualifications give rise to emerging education requirements in the area of personal competence, often conceptualized as emotional intelligence or social competence. [6] The starting point in the present paper is the acumen that value-adding leader performance is the outcome of persistent, deliberate practice and coaching instead of an innate talent or skill. [7] Engineering education providers subsequently need to acquire a better understanding of social competence and its most pertinent competence development needs. [8] This paper aims to define socially competent leadership and its most pertinent skills in the engineering context. Further, the paper proposes methodology responding to professional skilling requirements. The ultimate educational objective is to develop individual engineers and organizational leaders that not only possess traditional analytical and technical expertise and substantive knowledge but are intelligent also creatively, practically, and socially.","Engineering education; Professional skills; Social competence","Education; Industrial research; Managers; Motivation; Professional aspects; Emotional intelligence; Higher engineering educations; Industrial organization; Managerial communication; Organizational behavior; Personality dimensions; Professional skills; Social competences; Engineering education","Juholin, E., (2001) Communicare!

In this paper, we use reference discipline and author affiliation analysis of journal articles to provide data on the development of Engineering Education Research (EER) as a scholarly research field [1] and the diffusion of engineering education innovations [2]. In this study a total number of 139 articles published in 6 engineering education journals in 2011 were analysed with regard to reference discipline and the country affiliation of the authors. Analysis of reference disciplines has been used by scholars in the new disciplines of Information Systems and Enterprise Engineering research for the past two decades and involves a study of the disciplines referenced and cited in research papers to track the developing maturity of these fields of research. We propose that a similar approach can be useful in EER as an indicator of interdisciplinarity and a form of measuring the developing maturity of EER as a field and cross-fertilization between EER and other research fields. In addition, when this is combined with data on the affiliation of authors we can also obtain data on cross-fertilization within the field of EER beyond national boundaries. The journals were selected to obtain a mix between US based (JEE and AEE) and non-US general engineering education journals AJEE and IJEE), and also to include two disciplinary engineering education journals, CEE and IEEE Trans Educ. Knowing that similar work was already underway by other researchers for the European Journal of Education Research, we opted not to include it in our sample. For the research discipline analysis, each of the journal articles was classified independently by both authors and the results later discussed until the classifications were consensual. To satisfy our classifications system, a discipline needed to be specifically shown by the authors to underpin their research. Such references were normally found in the background or methodology sections of the papers and were frequently mentioned as keywords. Any disciplines which only appeared in the bibliographic references section were not considered reference disciplines. The results concerning the reference discipline approach are presented in Fig. 1. In the case of IEEE Transactions on Education and the Journal of Chemical Engineering Education, our results shows little evidence of reference disciplines which suggests that the research of the authors of the papers published in these discipline-based journals tends to be informed by concepts within rather narrow disciplinary confines. By contrast, the results for the general engineering education journals, particularly JEE, show that the authors appear to be reading more broadly and their work is informed by both engineering education research and other reference disciplines. This could be interpreted as a sign of interdisciplinarity and developing maturity of EER as a field of research. On the other hand, from an internationalization perspective, the limited number of countries involved in publishing research in the journals studied, seems to point to a lack of cross-dissemination of EER findings and suggests there may be barriers limiting the diffusion of proven educational innovation. Although the work presented, 139 articles from 6 EER journals in 2011, represents a relatively small sample of the overall volume of EER publications, we believe the study demonstrates the value of a bibliometric analysis approach to EER. It allows to study the developing maturity of the field, identify possible barriers to cross-fertilization and to help authors choose suitable publication channels.","Bibliometric analysis; Discipline; Engineering education research","Bibliographic retrieval systems; Chemical analysis; Diffusion barriers; Education; Engineering education; Publishing; Bibliographic references; Bibliometric analysis; Discipline; Educational innovations; Engineering education innovations; Engineering education research; Enterprise engineering; Reference discipline; Engineering research","Jesiek, B.K., Borrego, M., Beddoes, K., Hurtado, M., Rajendran, P., Sangam, D., Mapping global trends in engineering education research, 2005-2008 (2011) Int.

Educational research has concluded that the learning styles of many engineering students don't match with the teaching styles of most engineering professors. In order to make engineering education more appealing, motivating and rewarding for students, it needs to be reformed by taking the students' learning experience as the starting point. We've conducted a study with the objective to gather and assess European students' great learning experiences and define the educational methods that have behind these experiences, in order to spread these best practices around in engineering education. In the first phase of the study, we collected learning experiences with a qualitative questionnaire. In the second phase, we interviewed teachers who had been mentioned by name as having given an especially good learning experience to a student. Finally, we assessed the answers of both the students and the teachers in order to find what were the particular nuances which made the learning experience great to the student, and what was teacher's role in facilitating this experience. Based on study results obtained until now, we have defined five broader factors that seem to contribute most to the best learning experiences. They are: interaction with the teacher, continuous feedback, application of theory to practice, logic in explaining broad concepts first and then delving deeper, and lastly flexibility. Firstly, interaction with the teacher and exchange of ideas is crucial. We found out that students feel they learn more through discussion and group work, even when the teacher is just throwing out rhetoric questions and answering them himself. Enough time is needed for thinking, and a setting for reflecting ideas with peers and the teacher is essential. Secondly, continuous feedback during the learning process and encouragement from the teacher keeps students motivated through hardships in learning. To learn continuously through the course, students need to keep on track of whether they are learning the essential and really understanding it or just memorizing things superficially. Thirdly, coherence of theory and practice, together with application of theory to real life cases is found very important in technical and applied sciences. This might be considered self-evident but the student experience is that the connection of theory and practice should be smoother. Instead of teaching 'theory' and 'practice' separately, they should be integrated to prepare for solving real engineering problems. Knowing how the things we learn are applied in real life is the key to students' motivation. The fourth principal found was that teaching a complex phenomenon requires first breaking it down in simple terms and gradually compiling its building blocks together. Learning a complex and intricate matter is performed in the brain by processing and reorganizing knowledge of more simple sub-concepts. To start a learning process in the brain, the new matter to be learned needs a touching point to what is already familiar. Lastly, we found that students value flexibility of learning methods and focus of content according to individual interests and preferences. Within the framework of learning objectives of a course, the focus of individual interests may vary, and encouraging students to pursue what personally attracts them leads to more profound learning. The results of this study remain preliminary at this stage and we will proceed with a more widely spread questionnaire, more extensive interviews and a deeper analysis on the findings. However, these results should encourage professors to combine different kind of teaching methods to suit as many learning styles as possible. Providing time and space for reflection and exchange of ideas, giving continuous feedback, including practical applications and breaking complex problems into smaller ones in a logical manner should be principles taken into account at every course - the method naturally depending on the subject and external restrictions. We are bridging the gap between professors and students. Our vision is to see teachers using innovative teaching techniques that students perceive as effective and motivated students enjoying their learning even when it's hard work.","Best practice; Learning experience; Student point of view","Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Motivation; Surveys; Teaching; Best practices; Educational research; Engineering professors; Individual interests; Innovative teaching techniques; Learning experiences; Student experiences; Students' learning experiences; Students","Kapadia, R.J., Teaching and learning styles in engineering education (2008) Proc. of the 38th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, , Saratoga Springs, NY, USA; Kolmos, A., Holgaard, J.E., Learning styles of science and engineering students in problem and project based learning (2004) Proc. of SEFI Conference: The 21st Century: The Golden Opportunity for Engineering Education?, , Valencia, Spain; Felder, R.M., Brent, R., Understanding student differences (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1); Gardner, H., (2006) The Development and Education of the Mind, , New York: Basic Books","Kauppinen, A.; Tampere University of TechnologyFinland",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

This research stems from an idea that the students' conceptual understanding could reflect their underlying motivational factors [1,2] to study. The research was set up within one course of polymer technology with students from four different degree programmes. Within this specific field of engineering the research examines 1) whether there are identifiable differences in the conceptual learning between the students in the different degree programmes 2) whether the conceptual learning could be linked with different motivational factors. The research was carried out during the years 2009-2011 in the course ""Basics of Polymer Technology"" (3 ECTS). This course is compulsory for students in four different degree programmes and it is taken by 150-200 students yearly during one 6-week period. The majority of the students is 2nd year Bachelor students. To compare both the factual and conceptual learning of the students from the different degree programmes, a two-part questionnaire was designed. The same questions were given to the students at the very beginning and in the end of the course. The first part contained questions of both substance knowledge and attitudes. The aim was to evaluate the development of students' understanding of basic concepts of polymer technology. The second part was an essay titled ""Me and polymers ten years from now"". The aim of this question was to discover how the students' conceptual understanding of utilising polymers had developed during the course. [3,4,5] The results of the first parts of the study have been reported in [6,7]. The results show that degree programmes socialize their students effectively: they seem to develop rather strong professional identities already in the very beginning of the studies. E.g. one group of students saw themselves in a role of biomaterial developers whereas another group had the idea that polymeric materials will not be important for them professionally. Another interesting point was that a large number of students did not recognize the role of polymeric materials in everyday life. These perspectives reflect very different underlying motivational factors, which should be taken into account to ensure meaningful learning. The results could be utilized in developing this course in particular and, more generally, in developing the education on degree programme level by showing the potential of Engineering Education Research.","Conceptual learning; Motivation; Professional identity","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Motivation; Polymers; Conceptual knowledge; Conceptual learning; Conceptual understanding; Engineering education research; Higher engineering educations; Interesting points; Polymer technology; Professional identity; Students","Holmegaard, T.H., Ulriksen, L., Möller Madsen, L., Why students choose (not) to study engineering (2010) Annual Congress.

Moreover, research shows that when engineers get into the job market, communication is highly valued by them because they believe that it contributes to a successful career [9]. Similarly employers seek for people able to communicate [8]. To address this demand, two seminars taught in English, have been initiated at the Faculty of Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece focusing mainly on senior students, i.e. students in their final year of studies as well as postgraduate or Ph.D. students. Both seminars aimed at teaching the principles of technical communication, the English language structures used in written and oral forms of technical communication as well as the presentation techniques required in order to structure and deliver an effective technical proposal and presentation. In particular, the seminars were intensive and addressed two topics: ""Writing and presenting technical documents in English"" 30hs long and ""Presentation skills and techniques"" 12hs long. Seminars were designed on the tenet of learning outcome based curricula [2] while the humanistic approach in education [7] was considered when designing content and implementing the teaching approach. Additionally authentic tasks and communicative events to be faced by engineers in professional contexts formed part of homework since material of this type is included in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) courses [3]. Students evaluated seminars through a 23 close ended item questionnaire which included an open ended question requesting comments and remarks. Thus apart from quantitative data, qualitative data were elicited as well. Results indicated that students were satisfied with the seminars, that the ESP orientation embedded was valued by them since they practiced their English and learnt new knowledge related to their discipline while they commented positively on the humanistic teaching approach. In fact the latter triggered personal growth and transferable skills development. Qualitative data were also extracted from graduate engineers who after they had been exposed to situations requiring ability to communicate technical knowledge they appreciated the importance of the seminars. They also commented that technical communication had been learnt through experience so far therefore these seminars offer an alternative to this. Findings may be discussed in relation to two perspectives: a) the student perspective and b) the university perspective. Regarding students, the benefits are focused on the development of transferable skills via English. In other words, through professionally focused instruction of English, they practice skills which will be of use throughout their careers. Regarding university, findings show how a seminar taught in English with ESP focus, can achieve a lot more than simply teaching the language. It can be outcome based, job oriented and as results show, interesting for students.","Communication skills; English; ESP courses","Computational linguistics; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Engineers; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Teaching; Technical presentations; Communication skills; English; English for specific purpose; ESP courses; Open-ended questions; Presentation skills; Student perspectives; Technical communications; Students","Azami Zaharim, Y., Md Yusoff, M., Zaidi Omar, A., Mohamed, N.M., Employers perceptions and expectation toward engineering graduates: A case study (2009) Proceedings of the 6th WSEAS International Conference on Engineering Education, pp. 23-29; Cedefop, (2011) When Defining Learning Outcomes in Curricula, Every Learner Matters, , Briefing Note, March/April; Dudley-Evans, T., St John, M.J., (1998) Developments in ESP: A Multi-disciplinary Approach, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ngah, E., Radzuan, N.R.M., Fauzi, W.J., Abidin, N.A.Z., The need for competent work ready English language learners (2011) Procedia-social and Behavioral Sciences, 29, pp. 1490-1499; Kassim, H., Ali, F., English communicative events and skills needed at the workplace: Feedback from the industry (2010) English for Specific Purposes, 29, pp. 168-182; Martin, R., Maytham, B., Case, J., Fraser, D., Engineering graduates' perceptions of how well they were prepared for work in industry (2005) European Journal of Engineering Education, 30 (2), pp. 167-180; Moskowitz, G., (1978) Caring and Sharing in the Foreign Language Class, pp. 5-22. , Boston: Heinle & Heinle; Shah, N.Z., Are graduates to be blamed?

The shaping of the EHEA has been carried out by them according to common principles but not following common procedures, and as a result today there is a wide range of perspectives with national peculiarities. The change in Higher Education in Spain has not been either quick or easy, and the new system still keeps many defects of the traditional one. First, the process was initiated later than in most European countries, since basic legislation was not in force until October 2007 [1], after several unsuccessful attempts that were later discarded. As a consequence, in most of Spanish Universities the first promotions of students according to Bologna guidelines will not have their Degrees until July 2014. In spite of all, the change of Higher Education in Spain is taking place. In this presentation, we will try to outline the main characteristics of the Spanish educational landscape with reference to Engineering Education. A review of the system is carried out, with special reference to the so called Industrial Engineering Degrees (Mechanical, Electrical, Chemistry⋯). First of all, changes of content and structure of curricula are discussed, and also their influence on the acquisition of competences of students [2]. In this process, as Engineering is a regulated profession and the Degrees grant the access to engineering practice, their curricula have to follow legal requirements defined by the central government. These requirements were presented as a list of competences to be achieved by those graduating, and they have implied a tight framework on the contents of new curricula. On the other hand, the introduction of innovative teaching and learning methods, as required by the new regulation, is considered as well as the attitudes of both students and teachers towards them [3]. Finally, some comments on how to overcome present situation for putting Spanish engineering Curricula on an innovative path are also outlined. It is recommended a revision of content and methodology of new engineering curricula after the first years of their application, once the new promotions of graduates leave the universities. A proper account of their innovative aspects has to be done in that revision. In particular, the relative weight of optional subjects and a proper attention to practical training must be analyzed first. On the other hand, we have to remark the negative effects of successive cuts applied to budgets in Higher Education Institutions, with no pedagogical criteria, and aiming only at reducing cuts. Master lessons and bigger groups both for lectures and practical sessions are being presented as new paradigms. Financial cuts have also supposed a big reduction in courses for teachers training and for innovative projects. Those cuts together with more teaching hours for lecturers, higher registration fees, fewer and shorter grants for students, are creating a double segregation in Higher Education in Spain: inside, for more deprived students, and in the EHEA with respect to other well off countries.","Engineering; European higher education area (EHEA); New curricula; Spain","Budget control; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Laws and legislation; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Content and structure; Engineering curriculum; Engineering practices; European governments; European Higher Education Area; European higher education area (EHEA); Higher education institutions; Spain; Education","(2007) Por el Que Se Establece la Ordenación de las Enseñanzas Universitarias Oficiales, , RD 1393, de 29 de octubre BOE 30.10.07; Sánchez Elvira, A., López González, M.A., Fernández Sánchez, M.V., Analysis of generic competences in the new EHEA degrees in Spanish universities (2010) REDU Revista de Docencia Universitaria, 8 (1), pp. 35-73; Virgós, F., Peña, J.D., (2011) Los Nuevos Estudios de Ingeniería Industrial en el Marco de Bolonia, (293), pp. 26-34. , Técnica industrial; ME, (2011) Datos y Cifras del Sistema Universitario Español.

What is sometimes less acknowledged is that it also requires the adoption of a matching epistemology on the part of the student. To succeed in a student-centred environment students should see themselves and peers as valid sources of knowledge, integrate concepts, view knowledge as tentative, justify decisions in a rational way, accept they can improve as learners and that learning is a continuous process [1]. Enactment of such an advanced epistemology on exposure to student-centred learning should not be assumed to spontaneously occur. Rather, the learning environment should facilitate such development during the college years. In this paper we outline the history of research into personal epistemology starting with the stage models (Perry's model of intellectual development [1], Reflective Judgment Model [2], Women's Ways of Knowing [3], Epistemological Reflection Model [4]), moving on to the multi-dimensional [5, 6] and finally outlining the framework of epistemological resources model [7, 8]. The ontological and epistemological differences between these are discussed. Based on the resources model we investigate the influence of personal epistemology on aspects of design in a PBL module delivered in the second year of a three year electrical engineering technology programme in a third level institute in Ireland in which students design and build a weather station. Qualitative data were collected through one to one, semi-structured interviews with five participants and a focus group with six other participants. A questionnaire, Epistemological Beliefs Assessment in the Physical Sciences [EBAPS 9] was completed by a majority (n=32) of the class. The dimensions of epistemology we explored are self as a source of knowledge, concepts of justification and structure of knowledge, these being key epistemological issues for project-based learning. Qualitative differences in the enactment of these epistemological issues were observed among a sample of students who were interviewed. For one student, Oliver, certainty in knowledge was not expected in the context of the system he designed; compared to his peers he demonstrated a relatively independent approach to design and justified his product based on a well considered and comprehensive set of criteria. Oliver achieved a high score in the tutor's assessment of his contribution to the learning process. His enactment of personal epistemology seems very appropriate for PBL. The process mark assigned by the tutor supports conclusions drawn from the interviews in terms of the differences between Oliver and another student, Sean. Oliver's enactment of personal epistemology achieved a higher process mark. Sean chose not to look to himself for direction in design, instead searching the internet for solutions to adapt and taking direction from his peers. He justified his design based on a limited set of criteria. However, he appeared to have sufficient understanding and motivation to be independent but did not enact such independence in this module and achieved a low mark on his contribution to the learning process. If Sean were to enact a more advanced epistemology he could engage more with the module, develop better designs, produce better artifacts, improve his grade and become a better engineer. Through continued exposure to PBL with feedback on the learning process Sean could be encouraged to enact more appropriate epistemologies more often. The reflective reports prepared by the students could be more targeted to encourage change. In Sean's case, he could be asked to reflect on ways he justifies decisions by recalling good examples from any context in his life and exploring how he could transfer these to the context of engineering. Such an approach has been shown to be effective in creating change in conceptual understanding [10].","Design; Personal epistemology; Student-centred learning","Balloons; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Design; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Product design; Teaching; Conceptual understanding; Epistemological beliefs; Intellectual development; Personal epistemologies; Project based learning; Qualitative differences; Semi structured interviews; Student centred learning; Students","Chance, S., Strategic by design: Iterative approaches to educational planning (2010) Planning for Higher Education, 38 (2), pp. 40-54; Hofer, B.K., Personal epistemology research: Implications for learning and teaching (2001) Educational Psychology Review, 13 (4), pp. 353-383. , Dec; Perry, W.G., (1999) Forms of Intellectual and Ethical Development in the College Years: A Scheme, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers; King, P.M., Kitchener, K.S., Developing Reflective Judgement: Understanding and Promoting Intellectual Growth and Critical Thinking in Adolescents and Adults, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1994; Belenky, M.F., Tarule, J.M., Goldberger, N.R., (1997) Women's Ways of Knowing: The Development of Self, Voice, and Mind, , Tenth anniversary edition. ed., New York: Basic Books; Baxter Magolda, M.B., (1992) Knowing and Reasoning in College, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; Schommer, M., Effects of beliefs about the nature of knowledge on comprehension (1990) Journal of Educational Psychology, 82 (3), p. 498; Schommer-Aikins, M., An evolving theoretical framework for an epistemological belief system (2002) Personal Epistemology: The Psychology of Beliefs About Knowledge and Knowing, , B.

One commonly implemented instructional strategy to bridge these two types of gaps is to let students solve problems in groups, as this leads to better conceptual understanding and students are able to solve more complex problems in groups than individually [3,4]. There has, however, been very little research focusing on how the problem solving process changes when students solve physics problems together rather than individually. In this case study, we explore differences and similarities in how students formulate and solve physics problems in groups and individually. The empirical data comprised video-recorded sessions of students solving problems in groups [5] and semi-structured interviews with other students solving the same set of problems individually [2]. All students were enrolled in Engineering Physics at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. The problems were drawn from Newtonian mechanics and the solution to the problems required an understanding of basic notions such as force, friction, acceleration and system. Success on the problems also required an understanding of basic mathematical notions such as functions, systems of equations and derivatives. An analysis of the video-recordings and the interviews revealed how the students struggled with both near- and far transfer [6, 7], i.e. transfer to a similar and a different context. Moreover, different patterns of problem solving that were connected to the social context, i.e. if the problems were solved in groups or individually, became apparent. A comparison between these contexts illustrates some of the benefits of collaborative learning. Some implications for instruction are also discussed in the paper.","Collaborative learning; Newtonian mechanics; Problem solving; Transfer","Education; Engineering education; Functions; Mechanics; Students; Video recording; Chalmers University of Technology; Collaborative learning; Conceptual understanding; Instructional strategy; Newtonian mechanics; Problem solving process; Semi structured interviews; Transfer; Problem solving","Adawi, T., Ingerman, Å., Pendrill, A., How mathematical is conceptual understanding?

Therefore, recruiting students, especially women, to STEM programmes is seen as a problem to overcome in most developed countries [2]. As an institutional member of the ATTRACT ""Attracting students to science, technology and engineering education"" [3], Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) carried out questionnaires addressed to secondary and IST freshmen students in order to analyse students' background and engineering perceptions. Although women represent the majority of the graduates in almost all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the proportion of women in engineering is still lower than that of men [4]. In general, STEM fields are more likely to be chosen by men, even though in recent years girls, in many countries, have surpassed boys in science proficiency [5]. Engineering perceptions and how they differ between female and male students have been widely documented through the literature (see for example [6]). However, research rarely focuses on how students perceive engineering compared with other professions and how does it impact male and female perceptions. In light of the foregoing, this paper provides a gender comparison in terms of the perceived difficulty of the profession, effort required to undertake the programme, pay level and employers' recognition, since the understanding of how genders diverge may shed some light on new approaches to attract students for STEM programmes, especially female students. Females tend to be more concerned about the consequences that may derive from their decision. Therefore, they look for more information, and dedicate more time to the decision process. Male, on the contrary, assign more importance to the analysis of the information required to carry out the decision, being more assertive and objective [7]. This might explain the differences found between male and female programme/institution choices. According to [8], female students believe that they have to prove their skills to be approved, more strongly than men in STEM areas. This may be the reason why female students believe that engineering is neither a very well-paid profession, nor a recognized occupation among employers, and, therefore hesitating to choose it as a career. Hence, the path to balance the gender differences in engineering education may pass through clarifying these issues for young female potential candidates.","Engineering education; Gender; Recruitment; Women in engineering","Education; Engineering education; International cooperation; Professional aspects; Social sciences; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Developed countries; Gender; Gender differences; Organisation for economic co-operation and development; Perceived difficulties; Recruitment; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Women in engineering; Students","Bøe, M.V., Henriksen, E.K., Lyons, T., Schreiner, C., Participation in Science and Technology: Young people's achievement-related choices in late modern societies (2011) Studies in Science Education, 47 (1), pp. 37-72; EU, (2010) A European Strategy for Smart, Sustainable, and Inclusive Growth, , European Commission, Brussels; EU, (2004) Europe Needs More Scientists!, European Commission, Directorate-General for Research, High Level Group on Human Resources for Science and Technology in Europe, , Brussels; Ihsen, S., Jesiek, B., Kammasch, G., Beddoes, K., Diversity of didactical approaches to foster diversity of engineers (2010) Joint International IGIP-SEFI Annual Conference, IGIP-SEFI, , Trnava, Slovakia; Hanson, M., Engström, E., Kairamo, A., Varano, M., Enhance the attractiveness of studies in science and technology (2010) Joint International IGIP-SEFI Annual Conference, IGIP-SEFI, , Trnava, Slovakia; OECD, (2011) Education at a Glance 2011: OECD Indicators, , OECD Publishing; OECD, (2012) PISA IN FOCUS, , OECD Publishing; Whiston, S.C., Keller, B.K., The influences of the family of origin on career development: A review and analysis (2004) The Counseling Psychologist, 32 (4), pp. 493-568; Bandura, A., Barbaranelli, C., Caprara, G.V., Pastorelli, C., Self-efficacy beliefs as shapers of children's aspirations and career trajectories (2001) Child Development, 72 (1), pp. 187-206; Stevens, R., Amos, D., Jocuns, A., Garrison, L., Engineering as lifestyle and a meritocracy of difficulty: Two pervasive beliefs among engineering students and their possible effects (2007) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Honolulu, Hawaii; Mena, I.B., Diefes-Dux, H.A., First-year engineering students' portrayal of engineering in a proposed museum exhibit for middle school students (2012) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 21 (2), pp. 304-316; Metz, S., It takes a village to change the perception of engineering (2007) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Honolulu, Hawaii; Lizárraga, M.L., Baquedano, M.T., Cardelle-Elawar, M., Factors that affect decision making: Gender and age differences (2007) International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy, 7 (3), pp. 321-391; Ihsen, S., Höhle, E., Skok, R., Baldin, D., Women students at excellent technical universities in Germany (TU9) A Case Study (2009) SEFI Annual Conference, , Rotterdam, Netherlands","Reis, A.; Núcleo de Estatística e Prospectiva, Instituto Superior TécnicoPortugal",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

ATTRACT (Enhance the Attractiveness of Studies in Science and Technology) is a European Commission supported project aiming to increase knowledge and inform practice about student recruitment and retention in engineering and technology education. Within this project partners agreed to test and evaluate a method of visualising and monitoring student retention in a so-called footprint in selected fields of programmes. The tool was originally developed in the Swedish project ""Ung Ingenjör"" http://www.kth.se/unging The test had three sub aims: 1. The overall level was to test if the visualising method can be used to compare/benchmark engineering education in Europe concerning retention. 2. The next level was to test and evaluate how the method can be used in assessing engineering education. 3. The final level aimed to test if the method can be used to compare different student groups concerning study background coupled to retention. The footprint itself can only be an indicator as such and the reasons behind study progress, drop out, low graduation rate etc. can only be found through further quantitative and qualitative analysis and discussions. The results from this exercise show the complexity of finding reasons and proper actions. The results also show that the way of monitoring facts and figures in a visual presentation trigs the viewer to dig deeper and do further analysis.","Drop out; Graduation rate; Retention; Throughput","Drops; Education; Engineering education; Testing; Throughput; Drop-out; Engineering and technology; Graduation rates; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Retention; Science and Technology; Student recruitment; Visual presentation; Students","Ung Ingenjör, , www.kth.se/unging, Swedish; Wheeler, D.J., (1961) Understanding Variation, the Key to Managing Chaos, , SPC press, Knoxville Tennessee; Education Assessment Exercise - EAE, (2011) Utvärdering För Kvalitetsutveckling På KTH - En Projektsammanfattning, , Project summary, English version forthcoming, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, 2011","Marklund, B.; KTH Royal Institute of TechnologySweden",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

It was not only because these devices can be an element of disturbance during a lesson but also because they can be used by students for access to information in particular situations like exams. Due to these considerations we tried to take advantage of the wide use of mobile devices within a university class. In this paper the experience of mobile devices usage, combined with traditional teaching and learning media, in a technical faculty is reported. In the last years the development of new computing devices, based on powerful processors and advanced Operating Systems can be observed. There are two classes of devices that emerged quickly: tablets and smartphones. The course of Electrical Measurements at the Faculty of Engineering of ""La Sapienza"" in Rome was already based on a Moodle web site to implement e-learning [1]. Wi-Fi is available in the lecture rooms at the Faculty of Civil and Industrial Engineering. At the first lecture of Electrical Measurements course, students are informed that all the activities provided during the course will be done using mobile devices. Course activities are structured in the following way (an example of activities' scheme is represented here): - the lesson on a topic starts; - when the first part of the topic is concluded, students can have access to materials provided on the web site, usually in the PDF file format; - they are encouraged during the lesson to interact, suggesting other links to the sites where it is possible to find more information on the topic; - in the following lesson they must do a quiz containing the topics studied previously. The quiz is activated in real time on the web site during the lesson and there is a preset time to do it. Students can check their results when they have finished and the quiz tasks are closed. - assignments can be activated during the lessons at the following stages as well. The students' reports must be uploaded on the website. Due to the use of mobile devices all activities are performed better, everything is produced in an electronic format and corrections can be partially automated. The students' attention is higher and as a result students' satisfaction is greater, as the interaction with teachers and collaboration with classmates are performed in real time during the lessons [2]. The use of ICT within universities [3] helped to increase effectively the quality of higher education. The Moodle-based web site is a friendly environment for the exchange of information and it offers numerous possibilities for interaction among students, teachers and tutors. The combined use of Moodle and mobile devices is a powerful instrument for the improvement of quality of teaching and learning.","Blended learning; Engineering disciplines; Students' satisfaction; Tablet","Digital devices; Distance education; E-learning; Education; Electric variables measurement; Electronic document exchange; Engineering education; Mobile devices; Personal digital assistants; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Students; Websites; Blended learning; Electrical measurement; Engineering disciplines; Exchange of information; Quality of higher educations; Students' satisfaction; Tablet; Teaching and learning; Teaching","Podestà, L., Course management systems: Do they improve the quality of teaching and learning?

In this framework, the European Commission promotes the TEMPUS - Trans European Mobility Programme for University Studies [1]. Curricula harmonization and lifelong learning programme development in higher education are among the focused aspects of the TEMPUS programme [2]. The DEREL - Development of Environment and Resources Engineering Learning, is a three years TEMPUS project coordinated by the University of Firenze, in cooperation with colleagues of the Ss Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje financed and activated since October 2010. The DER-EL Project Consortium consists of 4 EU Universities (from Italy, Greece, Germany and Austria), 7 Partner Countries (PC) Universities (from FYR of Macedonia, Serbia and Albania), 1 PC Ministry, 4 PC National Agencies, 1 PC non governmental organization and 1 PC enterprise. The DEREL project is aimed to introduce a new, up-to-date, postgraduate second level curriculum in Environment and Resources Engineering at the Ss Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje (CMU), FYR of Macedonia, University of Novi Sad (UNS), Serbia and Polytechnic University of Tirana (PUT), Albania, based on the European Credit Transfer System and in accordance with the Bologna Process, following the criteria and conditions for setting up a Joint Postgraduate Degree. A second objective is to implement a sustainable regional network aimed to offer lifelong learning seminars for environment and resources engineering education and training of interested stakeholders and organize workshops focused on strengthening the links in the knowledge triangle: environment education-innovation-research, with participation of postgraduate students, public services, enterprises and NGO's. The curricula and lifelong learning courses development includes surveys of educational & labour market needs at the PC, organization of academic visits from PC to EU Universities, PC staff training and retraining, preparation and publication of educational materials and promotion documents, as well as project dissemination activities. Despite the very ambitious goals of the project proposal, all activities foreseen for the first 18 months were realized or are at a very advanced stage. The new postgraduate studies in Environment and Resources Engineering at CMU, UNS and PUT will start in September 2012 and they will include web-based and blended learning courses. Also, the good collaborative environment created, since 2005, with the project partners can be surely mentioned as an additional value of the project, enabling implementation of a sustainable regional network [3].","Distance learning; E-learning; Presence learning","Curricula; Distance education; E-learning; Education; Employment; Personnel training; Social networking (online); Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Collaborative environments; Education and training; Educational materials; Environment educations; European credit transfer systems; Nongovernmental organizations; Postgraduate students; Presence learning; Engineering education","McCabe, R., Ruffio, P., Heinämäki, P., TEMPUS @ 20 - A retrospective of the TEMPUS programme over the past twenty years (1990) Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union, , 2010, © European Union; European Commission, (2010) The EU Contribution to the European Higher Education Area, , Luxembourg: Publication Office of the European union; Reilly, J., Jongsma, A., (2011) Regional Seminars on University Governance in the TEMPUS Partner Countries (2010-2011), (8). , Conclusions, - October 2011; Caporali, E., Tuneski, A., Trajkovik, V., Palmisano, E., Valdiserri, J., Enhancing environmental engineering education in eastern Europe (2011) Proc. of the SEFI Annual Conference: Global Engineering Recognition, Sustainability, Mobility, Lisbon, Portugal, p. 659. , Editors: Jorge Bernardino and José Carlos Quadrado, 665 CD 124; Council of Europe, (2009) European Convention on Human Rights: As Amended by Protocols Nos. 11 and 14.

It covers research on learning and teaching in all engineering disciplines as well as in the supporting disciplines, like physics, chemistry, computing and mathematics, which form the scientific basis of engineering research. Moreover, EER draws on theories and research methodologies from social sciences, like education, psychology and sociology to investigate the many-faced aspects of learning and teaching engineering. In order to get a better overview of the whole field, there is a need to look at both what is being researched and how the research is carried out. The authors of this paper met in connection to a series of meetings arranged by the SEFI working group EER and a series of workshops organised by Line B of the EU project EUGENE, and decided to collaborate on the construction of a taxonomy for EER from a European perspective. The overall aim is to develop a taxonomy for the how aspect of EER. More specifically, we aim to identify what kind of theoretical frameworks and research designs that are being used, what kind of data that is collected and how it is analysed in EER papers. Our current analysis focuses on published papers in two major European EER forums: European Journal of Engineering Education and the EER track in the SEFI conference, but the taxonomy can obviously be used to analyse any other EER papers. We hope that this work will better reveal the richness of the field, but also highlight approaches that could be used more often in EER. Moreover, the results can be used to inform authors about differences between various publication forums, and emerging methodological trends in research. Finally, we will also look at how different aspects of research have been reported in EER papers with a view to providing suggestions for improving research reporting. In this paper we describe the taxonomy and how it was developed. The results of the analysis will be reported elsewhere.","Engineering Education Research; Literature analysis; Methodology; Taxonomy","Computation theory; Education; Engineering research; Social sciences; Taxonomies; Engineering disciplines; Engineering education research; Learning and teachings; Literature analysis; Methodology; Research designs; Research methodologies; Theoretical framework; Engineering education","The Steering Committee of the National Engineering Education Research Colloquies, The research agenda for the new discipline of engineering education (2006) Journal of Engineering Education, 95 (4), pp. 259-261; Wankat, P., An analysis of the articles in the Journal of Engineering Education (1999) Journal of Engineering Education, 88 (1), pp. 37-42; Wankat, P., Analysis of the first ten years of the Journal of Engineering Education (2004) Journal of Engineering Education, 93 (1), pp. 13-21; Whitin, K., Sheppard, S., Taking stock: An analysis of the publishing record as represented by the Journal of Engineering Education (2004) Journal of Engineering Education, 93 (1), pp. 5-12; Osorio, N., Osorio, M., Engineering education in Europe and the USA: An analysis of two journals (2002) Science and Technology Libraries, 23 (1), pp. 49-70; Osorio, N., What every engineer should know about engineering education (2005) Proc. of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) 2005 Illinois-Indiana Sectional Conference, , DeKalb, Illinois, USA; Borrego, M., Engineering education as a rigorous discipline: A study of the publication patterns of four coalitions (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (1), pp. 5-18; Jesiek, B.K., Borrego, M., Beddoes, K., Hurtado, M., Rajendran, P., Sangam, D., Mapping global trends in engineering education research, 2005-2008 (2011) International Journal of Engineering Education, 27 (1), pp. 77-90; De Graaff, E., Kolmos, A., Research methods in engineering education research (2010) Proc. of Joint International IGIP-SEFI Annual Conference 2010; Fincher, S., Petre, M., (2004) Computer Science Education Research, , Routledge; Pears, A., Seidman, S., Eney, C., Kinnunen, P., Malmi, L., Constructing a core literature for computing education research (2005) SIGCSE Bulletin, 37 (4), pp. 152-161; Simon, A classification of recent Australasian computing education publications (2007) Computer Science Education, 17 (3), pp. 155-170; Malmi, L., Sheard, J., Simon, B.R., Helminen, J., Korhonen, A., Myller, N., Sorva, J., Taherkhani, A., Characterizing research in computing education: A preliminary analysis of the literature (2010) Proc. of the Sixth International Workshop on Computing Education Research, pp. 3-12. , Aarhus, Denmark, 2010.

This module aims to provide Masters level students with experience of working in a multidisciplinary team to propose solutions to an unknown, unfamiliar issue. This ""real-world"" scenario is posed by industrial partner(s) and gives the students some experience of the type of work they will encounter during their careers: problems with no one right or wrong answer. Working in cross-disciplinary teams, sometimes for the first time, students use their problem solving skills and scientific approach, and present their ideas to a similarly cross-disciplinary panel. The pilot Grand Challenge took place in July/August 2011 for four weeks. The Challenge involved four teams of eight students from the Schools of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Electronic and Computer Engineering and Civil Engineering. Grand Challenge included structured sessions, designed to help develop employability skills and confidence, presented by the University's Careers and Employability Centre, Alumni and participating companies. The sessions included teamwork and team building, communication skills, personal development, reflection, personality analysis, environmental considerations, Intellectual Property awareness, corporate responsibility & professional ethics. Companies taking part were those which usually target University of Birmingham graduates for employment and included BT, Accenture, PWC, QinteiQ, TeachFirst, Alta Innovations and Atkins. The challenges were posed by IBM and by Atkins/Birmingham City Council, and although the students were at first daunted by the scale of these, they soon identified areas within each challenge on which they would focus. IBM challenged two teams to consider how to make Birmingham a smarter city and Atkins/Birmingham City Council asked the other two teams to propose how Birmingham might respond to the requirements of a European environmental award. At the end of the four weeks the teams presented their ideas without the aid of any presentation software -no PowerPoint or similar. This meant that the audience was treated to sketches, posters and video clips rather than bullet points. Students were assessed using a combination of peer review, a personal reflective essay and the group mark & presentation. They were also expected to complete a log book of personal skills which they would be able to utilise for graduate employment applications. Atkins and IBM each sponsored a small prize for the highest performing individuals from each challenge. The paper reports on the evaluation that was undertaken of both the pilot and ht second year of running Grand Challenge.","Communication skills; Grand challenge employability skills; Interdisciplinary teams; Problem solving; Reflection","Education; Engineering education; Problem solving; Reflection; Teaching; Communication skills; Corporate responsibility; Cross-disciplinary teams; Employability skills; Environmental considerations; Interdisciplinary teams; Multi-disciplinary teams; University of Birmingham; Students","(2009) The Demand for Science, , http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/migratedD/publications/D/Demand_for_STEM_Skills, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics STEM Skills' January; (2009) The Demand for STEM Graduates and Postgraduates, , http://tinyurl.com/9cstlk2, CIHE, January; http://www.hestem.ac.uk","Hawwash, K.I.M.; School of Civil Engineering, University of BirminghamUnited Kingdom",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

As a result, societies lack of qualified engineers who are necessary for the implementation of fundamental societal functions. This has led to the growing need to increase attractiveness of engineering studies and promote their awareness to potential students of engineering degrees. Furthermore it has prompt the importance identifying the right sort of students for a degree in engineering, ensuring that only those who really want to become engineers are enrolled, thus decreasing the number of dropout students. Previous work [5] investigated ways that Universities employ to attract students into engineering disciplines. In the context of the Academic Network of European and Global Engineering Education (EUGENE), a line of activities has been formulated which examines the concept of attractiveness of engineering studies within the European educational area. One of the main objectives of these activities has been to identify and disseminate the good practices in attracting students to engineering disciplines and degrees [5]. The purpose of this work is to go a step backwards by looking how students are guided and advised through the last three years of their high-school life (Unified Lyceum). This is a regional based survey that was designed and implemented for the educational system of Cyprus. The outcome of this work stressed the role of the SCs and showed that it is a provision in schools that is employed by many countries. The duties and responsibilities are specified according to the needs of each country's educational system. Regarding the Cypriot school counselling model, the results of our survey-based methodology depicted that very few school counsellors come from an engineering related background or in fact other related science backgrounds. Furthermore, most of the SCs have a postgraduate degree in school counselling related area. Advising is taking place in collaboration with the students and their parents. Students are advised to select a number of courses that will allow them to study a degree. This is done based on their skills, inclination and general interests. In addition, engineering related degrees are not as popular as others. However it is unknown whether the SCs have the capacity and the eligibility to give enough details and stir the interest of the students to follow an engineering discipline. In our view it is important that school counsellors who provide career advising to students who want to study engineering, should have engineering background themselves and should be in touch with the industry. An alternative solution from employing additional school counsellors coming from an engineering discipline is to involve people from industry who better understand the requirements of the current and future market and are up-to-date with the technological advances in industry.","Attractiveness; Career advising; Engineering education; School counsellors","Education computing; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects; Surveys; Teaching; Alternative solutions; Attractiveness; Career advising; Educational systems; Engineering disciplines; Postgraduate degrees; School counsellors; Technological advances; Students","Winckler, G., Fieder, M., Declining demand among students for science and engineering?

DO WE NEED QUALITY CRITERIA IN EER? In recent years research studies into critical factors for learning in engineering education (EER) have started to emerge in Europe and worldwide [1, 2]. In a review by Case and Light [3], it was ""argued that methodological decisions need to be more explicitly represented in reports ⋯ in engineering education research"", and in the review and meta-analysis conducted by Koro-Ljungberg and Douglas [4], it was found that the issue of methodology has received limited explicit discussion in EER-literature and that many studies lacked epistemological consistency. As will be suggested below methodological and perspective awareness and epistemological consistency are important aspects of quality. The conception of quality in scientific work is fundamental, and determines what researchers judge as reliable knowledge in their field. Although quality criteria are used daily in research, extensive reviews discussing research quality, especially in EER, are lacking. Borrego and Bernhard briefly discuss different views on quality in their review [2] and specifically discuss method-led versus problem-led research as well as their different views on quality. When a thorough discussion is lacking it poses the risk that the criteria applied tend to be isolated to the individual and that each individual has more or less well thought-out ideas about what is 'good' and what is 'bad'. Also, it could lead to an unquestioning acceptance of one research paradigm, or epistemology, which is often the dominant paradigm. This can lead to an inappropriate matching of research questions to methodologies, a confusion of reliability with validity, and a lack of transparency in the criteria being applied for what constitutes quality in research. We are of the view that although what we communicate in this paper will be relevant to quantitative research, we will focus on qualitative research since it is the area that induces the most controversial discussions about quality in contemporary EER. 2. A PROLEGOMENON TO QUALITY CRITERIA FOR EER We tentatively propose the criteria in table 1 in extension of those proposed by Larsson [5]. Table 1. Tentative quality criteria for (qualitative) engineering education research. <table> Some of the mentioned criteria could be considered contradictory and the right balance has to be established, while depending on the type of study, certain criteria are more important than others. The most imperative aspect of quality may be that we pose good research questions. In the full paper we will discuss these criteria in more detail. In order to develop high-quality EE research in the future, we argue that it is necessary that the EER-community begin to discuss quality criteria in earnest. We hope that our paper can serve as a genesis for such a discussion.","Methodology; Research quality; Validity","Education; Engineering education; Standards; Engineering education research; Learning in engineering; Methodology; Qualitative research; Quantitative research; Research quality; Research questions; Validity; Engineering research","Broadcasted (2012) P4 Granskar, , Vem hjälper dig när hjärtat stannat?

While all of these are important, educators are not necessarily the best professionals to address every one of these. However there are key aspects that are central to the concerns of educators and that they can and should be addressing if they are to make an impact in overcoming the issues that affect the profession. In this paper we concentrate of the challenges posed by (a), (b) and (c) and examine some of the issues and possible pitfalls that these present and how the academic community might respond to them. A few examples are given here. During a preuniversity time pupils may have only a vague idea of engineering, it's various branches, what they might expect to be doing as professional engineers and what skills they might need to be effective. Their teachers maybe no wiser, as they themselves might have little experience, other than in schools. An extensive Finnish study into competences sought by universities, and also those perceived by students leaving school, has highlighted some important areas for development [2]. By various means, teachers at schools and academics and their students can be very effective in establishing enthusiasm and enhancing application levels. Drop-out from courses is an area of concern, and much can be done to inhibit this, through changes in approaches to students, to teaching styles and recognition of the type of graduate that is hoped to be produced. In this paper the facets of these specific issues will be considered, together with possible ways by which they might be addressed in an effective way.","Attractiveness; Enthusiasm; Pre-university","Engineering education; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Academic community; Application level; Areas of concerns; Attractiveness; Enthusiasm; Pre-university; Professional engineer; University levels; Education","Schrey-Niemenmaa, K.S., Jones, M.E., Attractiveness in Engineering Education: Is all as it seems?

The problem is in part due to student attractiveness to the discipline, but also the variability in progression from a degree course to an engineering career due to motivational changes in educational need ([3], [4]). Several UK universities (as in many other European countries) currently provide a General Engineering (GE) entry to students. The advantages of such entry are typically reported as: (i) the provision of a broader foundation in engineering fundamentals (e.g. engineering maths and science) as well as skills-related components (e.g. design, communication and problem analysis); (ii) allowing students a more informed choice in degree specialisation selection, e.g. the option for students to defer specialisation until course tasters are sampled, or greater awareness of personal preferences in engineering work/application are realised; (iii) the preparation of students for a more versatile career, i.e. graduates who are able to apply their training to other engineering contexts. In this paper, the attractiveness of GE to student recruitment is explored through a national (UK) survey on pre-university (16-18 age group) students. Specifically, attention was given to student motivations towards flexibility in engineering specialisation, combined degree options (e.g. engineering and management) and exposure to other non-technical courses such as politics, business studies and languages. The study therefore addresses the following questions: 1. Is GE entry attractive to students who intend to study engineering? 2. Can GE entry help attract students into engineering who are considering studying a non-engineering mathematics/science based degree? How does this compare to a combined degree option? 3. What are the broader educational elements of university education that are particularly attractive to students? The survey was restricted to students who were undertaking qualifications that enabled entry into engineering degree programmes, e.g. A-levels in both mathematics and physics; a response rate of 1538 from this group was achieved. Attention was given to student motivations towards flexibility in discipline specialisation, combined degree options (e.g. engineering and management) and exposure to other non-technical courses such as politics, business studies and languages. Of those respondents who indicated a desire to enrol on an engineering degree (N=775; 50.4%), 30.7% were undecided on their choice of specialisation and 81.6% indicated a favourable response to a GE type programme. Of those respondents who were not considering an engineering career (N=763), 35.7% indicated a favourable response to a GE programme, i.e. given such a programme, 32.7% would ""possibly reconsider"" applying to engineering, and 3% would ""definitely reconsider"". Also for this cohort, 32.9% indicated a favourable response to a combined degree, i.e. 29.4% would ""possibly consider"" applying to such a programme and 3.5% would ""definitely consider"". As part of broader university education, ""important aspects of other engineering disciplines"" was ranked highest by students who were considering an engineering degree, followed by education in leadership, teamwork, environmental and sustainability studies and business skills. Students not considering an engineering degree ranked education in leadership as highest, followed by teamwork, self-awareness/personal development, business skills and international studies. The data indicates the potential attractiveness of GE to student recruitment. Student desires for wider engagement in professional skills development are also apparent, specifically in areas of leadership, teamwork, business skills and self-awareness/personal development.","Combined degrees; General Engineering; Skills development","Competition; Computational linguistics; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Motivation; Professional aspects; Surveys; Sustainable development; Technical presentations; Combined degrees; Competitive advantage; Engineering curriculum; Engineering disciplines; Engineering fundamentals; Engineering mathematics; General engineering; Skills development; Students","Lamb, F., Arlett, C., Dales, R., Ditchfield, R., Parkin, B., Wakeham, W.A., (2008) Royal Academy of Engineering Report: Engineering Graduates for Industry, , www.raeng.org.uk/education/scet/pdf/Engineering_graduates_for_industry_report.pdf(visitedMarch2012); Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) Report, (2011) Meeting the Challenge: Demand and Supply of Engineers in the UK, , www.imeche.org/Libraries/Position_Statements-Education/Skills_Report_-_September_2011_1.sflb.ashx, visited March 2012; Alpay, E., Ahearn, A.L., Graham, R.H., Bull, A.M.J., Student enthusiasm for engineering: Charting changes in student aspirations and motivation (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33, pp. 573-585; Hawwash, K., Attractiveness of education (2007) Teaching and Research in Engineering in Europe, , Eds.

Bourdieu's theories were developed as a means of exploring the role of social class on individual aspirations and behaviour. Current governmental and institutional aims to diversify the intake of engineering students [1] renders it appropriate for researchers to explore the motivations behind student decisions to study engineering. Issues of academic performance, retention and progression in an engineering program can be better understood against the background of individual student choice and behaviour. Bourdieu, an eminent French sociologist of the late 20th century, was most concerned with identifying and articulating the societal factors that perpetuate the 'status-quo' of a hierarchical social structure [2]. He saw educational systems as a key factor in the perpetuation and reproduction of social structures and so focused much of his work on educational settings [3]. Bourdieu's concept of habitus and its relationship to his concepts of field, cultural capital and dispositions form a theoretical framework and the basis of a methodology which enable the rigorous investigation of human actions and interactions [4]. His theories can be directly applied to questions of why students choose a particular career path and their subsequent behaviour and academic performance once within an educational institution [3]. He proposes that whether students stay in school or drop out is largely determined by their perceptions of the probability of success for students of their background [5]. As yet, Bourdieu's concepts have not been widely used as a framework within engineering education research; his theories are complex, fluid and relatively inaccessible to the novice sociologist [5]. Bourdieu's work presents a challenge to engineering education researchers to adopt or adapt this theoretical framework to underpin new investigations into engineering education phenomena. This paper will discuss his theories as a framework for future investigations into student choices (of engineering as a career, institution of study and mode of study); academic performance; retention and progression; institutional strategy and subsequent career trajectories.","Bourdieu; Diversity; Habitus; Student success","Education; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students; Bourdieu; Diversity; Educational institutions; Engineering education research; Habitus; Institutional strategy; Probability of success; Student success; Engineering research","Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Education indicators in focus series (2012) Working Papers Series, (1-5). , OECD Publishing; Reay, D., Editorial (2004) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 25 (4), pp. 411-413; Swartz, D., (1997) Culture and Power, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Reay, D., 'It's all becoming a habitus': Beyond the habitual use of habitus in educational research (2004) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 25 (4), pp. 431-444; Di Maggio, P., On Pierre Bourdieu (1979) American Journal of Sociology, 84 (6), pp. 1460-1474; Gilardi, S., Guglielmetti, C., University life of non-traditional students: Engagement styles and impact on attrition (2011) Journal of Higher Education, 82 (1), pp. 33-53; Baillie, C., Advancing diverse and inclusive engineering education practices through interdisciplinary research and scholarship (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 6-13; Jones, B.D., An analysis of motivation constructs with first-year engineering students: Relationships among expectancies, values, achievement, and career plans (2010) Journal of Engineering Education, 99 (4), pp. 319-336; Matusovich H.., Will I succeed in engineering?

The engineer profile has developed from the professional and scientific engineer of the last century to the enterprising engineer ([2]). This must also have an impact to the engineering education. While the new structure will, almost certainly, continue to be based on a solid preparation in mathematics and sciences, it is likely to emphasize the professional role of the engineer, and the demand of soft skills. In this paper we will explain how we tried to introduce soft skills elements into our new revision of the bachelor curriculum in computer science engineering. There are many reasons why a curriculum must be renewed in its structure. If you take into account a computer sciences engineering curriculum, you will certainly argue that the main need for renewal derives from the continuously evolving technologies, which generates new needs for technical skills in the future engineers. The engineer is daily confronted with many technical disciplines, and needs to be able to interact with peers from other fields. At the same time the importance of the engineer in the society is such that we cannot limit his role to the technical competences. He often holds responsibilities in his work that one should not underestimate. These are the reasons why we tried to consider further skills when redesigning our CS engineering bachelor curriculum during or last renewal process, started two years ago. We call here soft skills all required skills that are not strictly technical ones or basis mathematical skills, as required during the first semesters. The more visible soft skills are related with the personal communication, but this is only one aspect. Other ones have to do with the ability to work in team, the ability to take decisions, the readiness to adapt to new situations, etc. Interdisciplinary elements are also considered soft skills, even if they are more related to technology aspects, because what we want to train with interdisciplinary courses is not the specific mix of different technical disciplines, but the ability to afford more than one single aspect, having to do with different profiles, and the latter is clearly more related with soft abilities. Let us bring some figures to be able to get a quantitative overview of the new skills required and considered in the curriculum revision. Of course not all soft skills described here are new in the curriculum, some of them were already trained before. We give here however the current situation. Out of 180 ECTS, the total number of credits we consider for the bachelor studies, almost 70 are quite directly related with soft skills. Of course not all new skills are taught and exercised through dedicated courses. We have dedicated courses and courses where such non-technical skills are fostered as part of technical practical works and exercises. What we want to reach through dedicated courses within the curriculum is: general improvement in communication (oral and written communication, understanding the problems of intercultural communication), new language learning, career development, interpersonal skills, team building, and entrepreneurship. All these topics are learned and exercised within dedicated courses to an amount of 24 ECTS. The same and other skills will be learned and trained through works in laboratories (15 ECTS), where the students are expected to work divided in groups. Each group needs to be self-organized, will have an own ""customer"" (and need to understand its importance), will analyze the requirements (activity requiring strong interpersonal skills) and will need to present the results. The presentation is considered an important task within the laboratory requests. Of course the thesis work (14 ECTS) and other required activities or presentations within the curriculum will also exercise soft skills, in some cases more, in some cases less less. This is for instance the case with some modules in the third year that we introduced to foster multidisciplinary collaboration (until 10 ECTS), another important skill that every computer science engineer should train. We had the opportunity to renew our CS engineering curriculum and we tried to increase the time dedicated to soft skills. We do not have quantitative results to show, measured on our new students, due to the short-term introduction of the revision and due to the difficulty in measuring the direct benefits. We can only say that our effort has been at least appreciated, not last because we tried to explain our intents and the benefits that this can lead to in a longer term. We consider, in fact, that together with the investment in time and courses for soft skills, one important step is to explain the reason of their presence in a technical curriculum. It often happens that students in technical curricula do not appreciate non-technical courses, only because they consider them not useful for their career. Other than pushing them as such, it is then crucial to explain their largely recognized importance in their working life.","Interpersonal communication; Soft skills in engineering; Work in team","Curricula; Education; Employment; Engineering education; Engineers; Students; Computer science engineerings; Inter-cultural communications; Inter-personal communications; Interdisciplinary course; Multi-disciplinary collaborations; Oral and written communication; Soft skills; Work in teams; Personnel training","(2012) Engineering Education and the Bologna Process, SEFI Position Paper, a Joint Communication of SEFI and BEST in View of the 8th Ministerial Conference in Bucharest, , April; Edward, E., (2010) Soft Skills for Engineer, , http://www.slideshare.net/alphsedward/softskills-for-engineers; Goleman, D., (1997) Emotional Intelligence, , Bantam Books; Klaus, P., (2008) The Hard Truth About Soft Skills: Workplace Lessons Smart People Wish They'd Learned Sooner, , Peggy Klaus; Rost, J., Glass, R.L., (2011) The Dark Side of Software Engineering: Evil on Computing Projects, , Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press","Pedrazzini, S.; Dean of CS Engineering Curriculum, SUPSI, University of Applied Sciences of Southern SwitzerlandSwitzerland",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

It replaces the traditional ""one way"" flow of information, from research to education and from educators to students, by a ""both ways"" circular motion between the three corners of a triangle which, besides research and education, also includes innovation, the ""poor relation"" of many European universities. However, implementing the KT - a focal point in the seven flagships in the Europe 2020 strategy - is easier said than done. This paper aims to identify the processes that should be implemented so that the KT as a conceptual tool changes into a reality in the field. In order to do it, the authors refer to an approach presented last May the 18th by GOOSSENS and SJOER for the World Conference on Continuing Engineering Education in Valencia [1]. Following on what they presented one year ago at the SEFI Annual Conference in Lisbon [2] they propose to extend the aforementioned approach to the innovation process itself and make use of it in order to explain the drivers and barriers that the implementation of the Knowledge Triangle encounters in real life practice. The main research question is: ""What are the central issues in implementing the KT ?"". In this paper, the authors try to answer that question on the basis of three cases linked with the three corners of the KT. In the first case, students from Delft University of Technology have been consulted on their ideas about implementing the KT: the effect on the quality of education, how it could become a reality and to what extent they consider themselves able to contribute to innovation. It appeared that their mental model of what innovation means is short of practical information about their future work in industry, but also that they want to contribute to it. Therefore, university, with the help of the KT as a conceptual tool, has to introduce other forms of education and learning methods, based on a successful cooperation with their future professional world. The second case presents the perspective of the academic staff - supposed to act as an initiator and facilitator of the collaborative process of knowledge transfer and development - through the experience of Aalborg University with Problem Based Learning (PBL) as the educational approach for continuing education. The results were clear: though the academic staff know how to facilitate learning processes, they cannot find a good enough reason for getting involved in CE activities, which may very well be due to the lack of incitement structure towards those activities. And finally, the third case, linked with industry, presents a survey of the career perspectives that are being offered by industry to PhD graduates in engineering [3]. It appears that there is an important gap between the views of universities on how PhD graduates have to be prepared for working in industry and the expectations of industry for hiring PhD graduates. Some of the reasons explaining such a gap have been found and are discussed, partly on the basis of the aforementioned approach. In conclusion, the main barriers to implementing the KT lie in the gaps between the different mental models that people - and, by a loose coupling phenomenon, their organizations - have of their respective and reciprocal tasks, objectives and working processes. The Knowledge Triangle is directing to a 'commitment' of all stakeholders, so that they should carry through more successful innovation with different partners. This in turn should better satisfy their needs and induce them to change their mental models. Nevertheless, in order to initiate the process, it is necessary to raise among them the awareness of the need of implementing the KT (drivers) and of the dangers of not implementing it (barriers).","Innovation; Knowledge Triangle; PhD graduates in industry; Triple helix","Cognitive systems; Education; Education computing; Innovation; Knowledge management; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Students; Technology transfer; Collaborative process; Continuing engineering educations; Delft University of Technology; Educational approach; European universities; Knowledge Triangle; Problem based learning; Triple helixes; Engineering education","Markkula, M., (2011) Knowledge Triangle Answering the EU 2020 Needs and Challenges, , 6th Feb. 2011; Goossens, M., Sjoer, E., Expanding the concept of Knowledge Triangle to foster the working of the Triple Helix Model (2012) IACEE World Conference on CEE, UPV, , Valencia, 16th - 19th May 2012; Neisser, U., (1976) Cognition and Reality: Principles and Implications of Cognitive Psychology, , San Francisco, W.

For many young people, their choice of education is based on emotion and the identity they want to build, rather than rational, logical choice. They want to realize themselves and many of them want to ""do something related to sustainability/environment. http://www.naturfagsenteret.no/prosjekt/vis.html?tid=1519408. For our challenges to obtain sustainable solutions, knowledge in science and technology is important, and education programs within these areas must attract young people. This paper is about the development of a new competence based framework for Norwegian engineering education on bachelors level, and the challenge to make this education attractive through meeting the expectations of young people and show them how they can realize themselves through engineering and that they through the engineering profession can contribute to sustainable future changes. The vision above, as well as background, analysis, survey and materials essential for the project, its process and its results are presented and discussed in the paper. NOKUT - the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education performed an evaluation of Norwegian engineering education in 2008. In 2009, a national qualifications framework for higher education, based on The European Qualifications Framework for higher education, was adopted. On this background the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research initiated a project to revise the framework for engineering education. The work was initiated in 2010, and the framework will be fully implemented starting the academic year 2012/2013. An implementing process focusing on cooperation and concentration, a main goal within Norwegian higher education, is planned and is central in exploiting the potential given by the new framework. It was a goal of the committee, appointed by the ministry, to develop a framework which made it possible to strengthen totality, systems thinking and diversity in engineering education, with the vision that engineers in the future are seen as ""community committed, creative and empowered, with the ability to actively contribute to challenges of the future"". Other important goals were to attract new student groups, particularly women and to develop an education which is integrated and holistic and make use of a much broader variety of teaching and learning strategies than commonly used by today's engineering education. The paper presents the process and the results of developing the new framework for Norwegian engineering education, consisting of mandatory regulations and supporting national guidelines. Competences; learning outcome, described as knowledge, skills and general competences for all engineering candidates regardless of engineering area is the central part of the regulations (examples in table 1). (Table Presented) Many of the expected learning outcomes, competencies, for engineering candidates will result in both new ways of learning and evaluating as well as the need to build up new knowledge, skills and general expertise that are only poorly covered within today's study programs. The following topics, established based on analysis of background material from both theory and empirics, the mandate and objectives was central: corporate social responsibility, ethics and the engineer's role in society, systems thinking, integration of theory and practice, co-operation and student mobility, nationally and internationally, international term, admission, degree and transition to master level, interdisciplinarity, innovation and entrepreneurship, research based education as well as environment and ethics. A successful implementation of new engineering education will provide an engineering education with the following expected characteristics: Integrated and holistic education, In front by means of professional updating, Updated and varied learning- and evaluation methods, Research and development orientation, Professional competence and practical skills, International expertise, Interdisciplinarity, innovation and entrepreneurship, Study effort and coping, Engineering formation. Examples of indicators are shown in table 2. (Table Presented) Even if the full implementation starts the academic year 2012/2013, five institutions started fall 2011. Experience from these institutions already giving programs in accordance with the framework, show more motivated and engaged students, and more interaction between staff. An interesting further study is to follow and evaluate results from broad implementation, particularly how the use of learning outcome influence content, learning and evaluation.","Engineering competences; Qualifications framework; Sustainability; Systems approach","Education; Engineers; Laws and legislation; Philosophical aspects; Professional aspects; Quality assurance; Quality control; Social aspects; Students; Sustainable development; System theory; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Engineering competences; European qualifications frameworks; Expected learning outcomes; Qualifications framework; Research and development; Systems approach; Teaching and learning strategy; Engineering education","Schreiner, C., Henriksen, E.K., Sjaastad, J., Jensen, F., Løken, M., Project Lily: Choosing - Or not choosing - STEM higher education in Norway (2010) The Norwegian Centre for Science Education, , http://www.naturfagsenteret.no/prosjekt/vis.html?tid=1519408; Evaluation of Norwegian engineering education, English summary, http://www.nokut.no/Documents/NOKUT/Artikkelbibliotek/Norsk_utdanning/Evaluering/INGEVA/Rapporter/INGEVA_NOKUT_Summary_english.pdf; Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research, Norwegian qualifications framework, levels and learning outcome descriptors (2012) Approved by Ministry of Education and Research, , http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/Selected-topics/higher-education/nasjonaltkvalifikasjonsrammeverk.html?id=564809, Feb.1 2012, Oslo; Biggs, J.B., Tang, C., (2007) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Open University Press; Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research, , http://www.cesaer.org/en/home; (2010) Enhancing Creativity and Innovation, Including Entrepreneurship, at All Levels of Education and Training, , http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learningpolicy/doc/report09/chapter4_en.pdf, EU; (2008) EUR-ACE® Framework Standards for the Accreditation of Engineering Programmes, , http://www.feani.org/site; Assuring standards and quality, The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, , http://www.qaa.ac.uk/AssuringStandardsAndQuality/Pages/default.aspx, UK; Young, M.F.D., National qualifications frameworks as a global phenomenon: A comparative perspective (2003) Journal of Education and Work, 16 (3), pp. 223-237","Jakobsen, M.M.; Norwegian Association of Higher Education Institutions (UHR)Norway",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

Given that dealing with such a task requires expertise and experience, the education of future architects and building engineers could be characterized quite a challenge. In an attempt to simplify the preliminary design and construction procedures, in terms of the Building Science education, this paper presents a method for investigating, organizing and planning the initial and design construction stages of a conventional small house. In particular, this paper analyzes the configuration of a model computer program for preliminary building plans, as an educational tool, whose utilization could, indeed, claim a substantial and significant role both in secondary and higher engineering education. The model computer program for preliminary building plans is a complex algorithm, which: a) Being continuously and properly updated, organizes and stores a number of alternative building materials and information, as well as a number of alternative drafts of modern, building constructions. b) Records and organizes the specification requirements (time, financial, construction and operational requirements) of the individual user-student who seeks initial guidance and instructions on how to construct a simple building (e.g. a small house). c) Searches and determines, based on the above stored information, alternative building products (building materials and final building plans) whose specifications meet the aforementioned requirements and, finally, presents them to the user. This research aims to: a) document and organize appropriately, the most common specification requirements that correspond to the conventional construction of a small house. b) present lists of alternative building materials and information, alternative drafts that meet the aforementioned requirements. c) develop the basic principles required in a computer program that collects and organizes all information needed, searches and ranks properly all building materials and, finally, combines all the above in order to recommend optimum building plans. d) present an example of the basic structure and functionality of such a computer program along with the way of actually utilizing it by people interested in the specific area of expertise, i.e. educators and trainee architects-building engineers. e) suggest ways of extending current program implementation and provide possible routes for future work.","Building Science; Correlation; Education; Geometry","Architectural design; Building materials; Buildings; C (programming language); Correlation methods; Design; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Geometry; Houses; Specifications; Alternative building materials; Building science; Conventional constructions; Design and construction; Higher engineering educations; Operational requirements; Program implementation; Specification requirement; Construction","Ernst, N., (2003) Building and Architectural design, , Giourdas M., Athens; Klein, H., (2008) Basis, Project Planning, , Birkhäuser, Basel-Boston-Berlin; Arthur, (2001) Architectural Design Procedures, , McGraw-Hill Education, Europe","Skaraki, A.S.; Civil Engineering A.U.TH.Greece",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

They may be considered an added value to physical, electrical and biomedical engineering education, providing an important training on optics, optoelectronics and photonics. A research effort has also been put on the use of coatings to modify the response of optical fiber gratings. It can be expected that diamond coatings onto the sensors can significantly extend its capability, such as enhancing its mechanical strength, protecting it from chemical erosion, increasing its high temperature limit and prolonging its lifetime, especially for high temperature applications. The design of optical platforms based on fiber sensing technology for monitoring the operating conditions and the wine evolution during the vinification process has also been under development. The specification of sensors is established according to chemical and physical parameters, sensitivity, working range and spatial distribution. The potential applications of Bragg sensors for monitoring arterial pressure waveform will be analyzed and discussed. They are able of sensing displacements in the sub-nanometer scale, with bandwidths well within the range of cardiovascular dynamics. The development of Bragg sensors for real-time monitoring of lithium batteries performance will also be presented. They have been extensively used in portable electronics and being pursued as power sources for hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles. The main objectives are the measurement of internal temperature and pressure during various charge and discharge conditions, such as high current densities, short circuit and overcharge. They are key issues for safety. The design and development of these projects can be successfully explored within physical engineering master courses programmes.

In total, the engineering faculties and schools in 33 publically-funded universities graduate about 9,000 students per year in formative bachelor and master degree qualifications to commence supervised practice as professional engineers. Some of the universities also graduate about 2,000 engineering technologists and engineering technicians. Since Australia's demand for all engineering occupations exceeds supply, the universities aim to enrol and graduate as many students as can meet the required standards. These must cover the changing demands of employers and the profession, and students. These demands and needs, and directions for educational improvement and change, have been explored over the past three decades in consultative national reviews, most recently in 2007-8 [1]. The Australian findings and concerns are similar to those of other countries, including USA [2]. Australian universities are independently responsible for quality assurance of their award programs. From 2015, these will be subject to formal compliance with the national qualifications framework, as part of the new national tertiary education regulatory authority. The formative qualifications in engineering have, however, been accredited for several decades by the national professional membership-based organisation, Engineers Australia. Their accreditation process has thus set the national standards for all three formative qualifications in engineering and all the engineering schools seek accreditation. The outcomes-based accreditation system defines sixteen 'elements of competency', covering knowledge and skills, engineering ability, and personal and professional attributes, for the formative qualifications for each of the three engineering occupations. These specifications were revised in 2009-10 as a result of the 2007-8 review. The expression of these outcomes and their elaboration with 'indicators of attainment' is intended to assist curriculum designers to ensure coverage of the required graduate attributes. The accreditation system is also intended to support innovation in curriculum design and delivery, and encourage development and adoption of evidence-based best practice. The 2007-8 review found that nationally, the engineering education system was performing reasonably well. Examples of very good practice were evident, but there were also many areas in which improvements could be made. Then and since, problem and project-based learning have been more widely adopted, professors of engineering education have been appointed and engineering education research is being recognised. Three of the review's six broad recommendations focussed on improving the authenticity of engineering education. An authentic curriculum uses best possible pedagogy and has strong relationships with contemporary engineering practice. Authentic educators are knowledgeable of educational best-practice and contemporary engineering practice, as well as being researchers in engineering science. Many of the educational improvements being undertaken in the universities lie within this theme of increasing authenticity. Two national bodies represent the engineering education community: the Australasian Association for Engineering Education (AAEE) for engineering educators; and the Australian Council of Engineering Deans (ACED) representing the faculty leaders. These organisations work together, and with Engineers Australia, to stimulate and support initiatives to improve engineering education, and the support the engineering educators within the universities. During 2011-12, they ran workshops on outcomes-based accreditation and curriculum design. Since 2006, these efforts have been assisted by competitively-won funding from the national Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT) and its predecessors. The first of these funded ACED to lead the discipline review of engineering [1]. Alongside that initiative and since, engineering educators have won fellowships, projects and program grants. The fellowships have supported prominent educators to develop and disseminate work on engineering pedagogy, mentoring for outcomes-based education, and collaborative self and peer assessment. Most of the project funding has been awarded to multi-institution teams to enhance and disseminate best practice in areas such as remote-access laboratories, teaching and assessing meta-attributes, learning environments, student attrition and retention, student learning in engineering mechanics, and gender inclusivity. Discipline-wide funding has been provided to ACED to deliver short workshops on 'Improving Teaching', disseminate project outcomes, and develop a new resources portal. The limited funding available to the OLT severely limits its capacity to support any particular discipline. In conclusion, it is argued that all the national bodies and initiatives referred to continue to be extremely valuable for focusing and supporting continuous improvement in engineering education in Australia. The main challenge is to increase the rate of improvement and adoption of best-practice in engineering education, so that students and employers are better served. The current university-wide drivers do not, in general, provide strong incentives to academic staff to invest in much professional development of their educational skills. To increase the visibility and momentum for and in educational change, a group of leaders in the engineering education community including the author, are working on the creation of a national networked centre for engineering education.","Accreditation; Continuous improvement; Engineering education","Accreditation; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Engineering research; Engineers; Finance; Iron and steel plants; Lubrication; Professional aspects; Project management; Quality assurance; Regulatory compliance; Societies and institutions; Standards; Students; Teaching; Continuous improvements; Educational improvement; Engineering education research; Engineering education systems; Engineering technologists; Problem- and project-based learning; Professional development; Remote access laboratories; Engineering education","Institution of Engineers Australia, (1996) Changing the Culture: Engineering Education Into the Future, , IEAust, Canberra; King, R., (2008) Engineers for the Future: Addressing the Quality and Supply of Australian Engineering Graduates for the 21st Century, , http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/ACED/Engineers%20for%20the%20Future.pdf, ACED; Biggs, J., Tang, C., (2011) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , 4th ed., Open University/McGrawHill, Maidenhead, UK; Sheppard, S., Macatangay, K., Colby, A., Sullivan, W., Educating Engineers: Designing for the future of the field (2009) Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, , Jossey-Bass/Wiley, San Fransisco; Australian Qualifications Framework Council, (2011) Australian Qualifications Framework, , http://www.aqf.edu.au/Portals/0/Documents/Handbook/AustQuals%20FrmwrkFirstEditionJuly2011_FINAL.pdf, 1st ed; Intern'l Engineering Alliance, (2009) Graduate Attributes and Professional Competencies, , http://www.washingtonaccord.org/IEA-Grad-Attr-Prof-Competencies-v2.pdf; Engineers Australia, (2001) Stage 1 Competency Standards, , http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/about-us/program-accreditation; Crawley, E., Malmqvist, J., Lucas, W., Brodeur, D., (2011) The CDIO Syllabus V2.0, , http://www.cdio.org/files/project/file/cdio_syllabus_v2.pdf; Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , http://www.aaee.com.au; Reidsema, C., Hadgraft, R., Cameron, I., King, R., Change strategies for educational transformation (2011) Proc. 2011 AAEE Conference, pp. 344-350. , ed.

Studies exist that point out links between someone's type and the capacity to create and innovate. Various concrete applications also exist to develop the innovative potential of individuals and groups. The limit of these studies and applications is that they do not take into account the engineering methods already used by the persons. From this point of view, our study can be seen as an original one. Moreover, the practical applications of types and innovations are not meant to be used in an academic context and to take into account the educational relationship between teachers and students. The subject of our study is to understand how relevant an approach developed in Psychology can be in improving the learning and use of innovative tools and methods while taking into account the training context and the relationships. On this basis, our methodological choices will be oriented by three hypotheses: a) the engineering innovation tools and methods can be characterised from a typological point of view and this ""type"" influences their appropriation by students; b) a teacher's/monitor's personality type determines the way the tools and methods are presented to students; c) the typological approach can be of use in accompanying the project monitoring. To test these hypotheses, our methodological framework includes: a) a questionnaire to ask third-year students what their personality type is and what are their two favourite innovation tools/methods amongst those taught; b) simultaneously, we will gather the innovation teachers of the school to see if they can achieve a consensus in determining what could be the typological description of each innovation tool/method - if a consensus is obtained, it will be compared with the students' questionnaire results c) the interactions between monitors and their groups of students will be observed during the early months of the innovative projects, when the main methodological choices are made; d) theses observations in situwill be completed with semi-directive interviews using explicitationtechniques with both monitors and students to better understand how cognitive preferences are involved in the choices. On the basis of all these results, a method to accompany innovation groups in a training perspective will be formulated, tested and improved according to the experiment feed-back. During our study, we will have to be watchful of two issues. The first concerns our epistemological positioning as two of the authors are involved in the innovation training and in accompanying projects provided at the school, they will be both practitioners and researchers and will also work with colleagues. The second issue is ethical. Although the purpose of the typological approach is to describe someone's preferred way of functioning, it does not seek to lock people in their own preferences. We will have to be aware of this issue and make sure that what we propose will not lead teachers and students to please themselves in their own preferences, but to build on them for the acquisition of new knowledge and expertise.The National School in Industrial Engineering (ENSGSI, based in Nancy, France), prepares students for the management of innovative projects. This French school offers a three-year general engineering programme based both on Engineering Science and Management, as well as integrating active teaching and learning through hands-on experience. It has been engaged in a continuous set-up of its innovation training programme since its creation seventeen years ago. The research, whose preliminary elements will be presented in this paper, takes place within this continuing improvement process. It starts with the observations made by the Engineering Science teachers in charge of tutoring the group of students working on a one-year innovative industrial project. They are faced with the difficulty of leading the students to test and apply to a large variety of innovation tools and methods to the project rather than focusing on a small number of them. They are conscious that all the methods and tools taught might not have a concrete application within the project. Yet, according to their experience, they find it difficult to understand why the students test so few: the students' lack of openness is a bit paradoxical as, on one hand, they ask for suggestions and direction whereas, on the other hand, they do not integrate them when they involve new testing methods. Closer observation suggests that the students' unwillingness cannot be ascribed to the fact that the methods ignored are neither more difficult to apply nor less relevant for the project. Hence the assumption that one method would fit better the student methods of collecting and using information; the choice of one tool/method rather than another one would seem to depend on cognitive personal preferences. Through discussions, the scope of the study was expanded to take into account key elements of the pedagogical relationship: the tutor's cognitive preferences, those of the student and also group dynamics are factors that can determine the choice of methods. To investigate these elements we mobilise the Psychological types theory elaborated by the Swiss psychoanalyst and psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung - and especially the MBTI ©, one of the most studied and reliable tool based on this approach.","Innovation training; Project-based learning; Psychological types; Teacher training","Concretes; Education; Engineering education; Innovation; Personnel training; Project management; Surveys; Teaching; Testing; Concrete applications; Engineering innovations; General engineering; Innovative projects; Methodological frameworks; Project based learning; Psychological types; Teacher training; Students","Morel, L., Guidat, C., Innovation in engineering education: A French sample of design and continuous updating of an engineering school to industrial needs (2005) International Journal of Technology Management, 32 (1-2), pp. 57-72; Briggs Myers, I., Myers, P.B., (1995) Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Types, , Davies-Black Publishing, London; Boly, V., Morel, L., Camargo, M., From management of technology to innovation management: Seventeen years of higher education (2012) Proc. of the International Association for Management of Technology 2012 Conference, IAMOT, 10p. , Taïwan, numerical proceedings; Marx, R.W., Blumenfeld, P.C., Krajcik, J.S., Blunk, M., Crawford, B., Kelley, B., Meyer, K.M., Enacting project-based science: Experience of four middle grade teachers (1994) Elementary School Journal, 94, pp. 517-538; Ladewski, B.G., Krajcil, J.S., Harvey, C.L., A middle grade science teacher's emerging understanding of project-based instruction (1994) Elementary School Journal, 94, pp. 498-515; Jung, C.G., (1921) Les Types Psychologiques, , Georg, Paris 1968 pour la présente edition; Myers, K.D., Kirby, L.K., (1994) Introduction to Type Dynamics and Development, , CPP Inc., Palo Alto CA; Cauvin, P., Cailloux, G., (2002) Les Types de Personnalité: Les Connaître et les Appliquer Avec le MBTI, , ESF Editeur, Paris; Capraro, R.M., Capraro, M.M., Myers-Briggs Type Indicator score reliability across: Studies a meta-analytic reliability generalization study (2002) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 62 (4), pp. 590-602; Briggs-Myers, I., (1998) Introduction Aux Types Psychologiques, , CPP Inc., Mountain view CA; Hirsh, E., Hirsh, K.W., Krebs Hirsh, S., (2003) Introduction to Type and Team, , CPP Inc., Mountain view CA; Tucker, J., (2008) Introduction to Type and Project Management, , CPP Inc., Mountain view CA; Fisher, D., Fraser, B., Kent, H., Relationships, between teacher-student interpersonal behaviour and teacher personality (1998) School Psychology International, 19 (2), pp. 99-119; Carne, G.C., Kirton, M.J., Styles of creativity: Test-score correlations between Kirton Adaptation-Innovation Inventory and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (1982) Psychological Reports, 50 (1), pp. 31-36; Kirton, M.J., (1989) Adaptators and Innovators: Styles of Creativity and Problem Solving, , Routlededge, New York; Bladock, J., Beyond innovation: Reflecting on the theme of working creaticely with type and temperament (2003) Australian Psychological Type Review, 5 (2), pp. 27-30; Stevens, G.A., Burley, J., Piloting the rocket of radical innovation: Selecting the right people for the right roles dramatically imprives the effectiveness of new business development (2003) Research Technology Management, 46, pp. 16-25; Segal, M.L., (2003) Quick Guide to the Four Temperaments and Creativity: A Psychological Understanding of Innovation, , Telos Publications, Huntington Beach CA; Tidd, J., Bessant, J., Pavitt, K., (2009) Managing Innovation: Integrating Technological, Market and Organization Change, , John Wiley Edition, Chichester UK; Killen, D., Williams, G., (2009) Introduction to Type and Innovation, , CPP Inc., Mountain view CA; Maurel, M., The Explicitation interview: Examples and applications (2009) Journal of Consciousness Studies, 16 (10-12), pp. 58-89; Liu, M., (1997) Fondements et Pratiques de la Recherche-action, , L'Harmattan, Paris; Thibaudier, V., (2011) 100% Jung, , Eds Eyrolles, Paris","Bary, R.; Department of Educational Science, ERPI, University of LorraineFrance",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

In the Netherlands, for example, right wing (populist) politicians have been criticizing the self-evidence of sustainability. Considering the number of their voters, this must be taken seriously, also by education institutions. Considering the number of voters, who want to spend less effort in sustainable technology, but also in aid programs for the poorest of this world, it is likely that a number of our students share this criticism. In this paper, not sustainability as such is addressed, but an ethical concept closely related to it: responsibility. An engineer feeling in some way or another responsible for a broader circle of people, whether living now or in the future, is more likely to participate in sustainable engineering compared to someone lacking this feeling of responsibility. Two workshops have been developed in order to trigger the reflection on this ethical concept of responsibility. The objective of these workshops is the awareness of one's own opinions in this matter. The two workshops articulate the thoughts of two contemporary philosophers, Hans Jonas (1903-1993) and Peter Singer (1946), who have both developed ideas on responsibility. Their thought is summarized briefly at the beginning of the workshops and from that point onward students discuss the ideas, using the World Café Concept [1], which gives every individual participant an opportunity to participate and put forward his or her own reflections on the matter. The workshops both start with a brief summary of the main argument of the philosopher. Hans Jonas has become famous with his work Das Prinzip Verantwortung(1979) in which he develops an imperative for the modern era [2]. Jonas is strongly aware that modern technology (e.g. nuclear technology) has unprecedented opportunities but also unprecedented risks for the future of mankind and nature. If mankind doesn't take action (take responsibility) a future for mankind is by no means secure. He tries to develop a consistent and future oriented ethics, which preludes the Brundtland statement. Instead of putting our trust on future generations, especially in their (superior) ability to cope with possible consequences of our actions, Jonas articulated his so called heuristics of fear: we must be aware of the grimmest of scenarios, emerging from our behaviour, and therefore take the necessary actions without delay. We have to act in a way that future existence of mankind is not jeopardized. Peter Singer does not search for an imperative, like Jonas does, but he tries to develop a utilitarian ethics, equally rigid as the ethics of Hans Jonas. While Jonas is concerned mainly with future existence of mankind, Singer's main concern are those living now, both human and not-human, in inhumane conditions. Using a simple thought experiment, that of someone passing a pond, while a little child falls in with the risk of drowning, he starts his argument [3, p. 3 and 4, p. 199-200]. We oughtto help a child drowning. When we know suffering exists and we have an opportunity to help, without putting our own lives at risk, we ought to help. Following a simple utilitarian calculus, we can argue that a bit less luxury in the west is a cost incomparable to the gain of the number of lives saved. If we accept the idea that all suffering is of equal value, it makes one responsible for others, even if one does not know this person. His or her suffering in itself is enough reason to help. After the brief introduction to the thought of Jonas and Singer, the group of students is divided in small groups of four persons each, and they are asked to discuss the ethics, first from the perspective of a willing listener, to see if the argument is really clear. After that, students get the opportunity to articulate their criticism, which can be discussed afterwards, in a plenary session. After the plenary session, two new rounds of discussions in small groups are held in order to discuss the consequences of the ethics discussed for personal development as an engineer. During the discussions in small groups, statements are written down on cards, which are afterwards collected by the moderator. During the week after the workshop, students are asked to evaluate the workshops, both the form and the content. Using these evaluations, the workshops are revised for possible future use.","Ethics; Philosophy; Sustainability","Accidents; Calculations; Education; Engineering education; Students; Sustainable development; Education institutions; Ethics; Modern technologies; Personal development; Philosophy; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable technology; Thought experiments; Philosophical aspects","Jonas, H., (1979) Das Prinzip Verantwortung, , Suhrkamp, Frankfurt a.

Thirty three engineering students evaluated two case studies that present ethical dilemmas in addition to measuring individual personality through Paulhus' Spheres [3] specific measures of perceived control model and Graziano, Habashi, and Woodcock's Person and Thing Orientations Scale [4]. The findings of the study expand our knowledge of how students acquire moral reasoning and what can be done to improve learning about ethics in engineering. Having an understanding of students' personalities in the beginning of teaching the engineering ethics course could have the potential benefit of creating the curriculum accommodating these differences. We also hope to bring awareness that different personality factors contribute to the ethical decision making in engineering students and practicing the profession engineers.","Engineering ethics; Ethics; Personality","Behavioral research; Curricula; Decision making; Education; Education computing; Philosophical aspects; Professional aspects; Students; Teaching; Engineering ethics; Ethical decision making; Ethics; Ethics in engineerings; Personality; Professional identity; Teaching and learning; Undergraduate engineering; Engineering education","Bairaktarova, D., Evangelou, D., Development of an engineering ethics course (2011) Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, , Vancouver, Canada, June 26-29, 2011; Rest, J., (1986) Moral Development.

Government, students, research councils and industry expect HEIs to deliver ever higher quality education and research, and HEIs need to have strategies to deal with such expectations. This paper explores one of the strategies chosen by KTH Royal Institute of Technology: self-initiated evaluation, exemplified by an Education Assessment Exercise (EAE) undertaken in 2011. In the paper, the context in which the project came about is discussed. Further, the project process, with emphasis on the self-evaluation phase, is described and analysed. This is in order to make an assessment on the benefits of the project so far, and to identify the issues that merit further consideration in future. THE CONTEXT In the paper, it is argued that the EAE project is best understood in the context of Swedish and European higher education politics and the on-going transformation thereof. The autonomy movement, in tandem with the expansion of quality assurance in higher education, are key characteristics of this transformation. The EAE is described as a strategic attempt by KTH management at channelling internal development needs and external demands into one project. Table 1 describes the EAE in relation to the scope and aims covered by the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG) and by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education (HSV) evaluations. THE EAE PROJECT The EAE project was a comprehensive internal evaluation of 90 education programmes at KTH, undertaken in 2011. It primarily had a formative aim. In the project process, it was hoped that new arenas for discussion and reflection would emerge which in turn would foster quality enhancement. In part, the EAE also had a summative aim. The intention was to assess whether the intended learning outcomes had been achieved by KTH students, and thereby provide a status report in advance of the external HSV evaluation scheduled to take place in the latter half of 2012. In the EAE, an internationally recognised methodology was used, comprising self-evaluation at programme level, followed by peer review including site visit and report by an external, internationally composed panel of assessors. The self-evaluation format included questions on the prerequisites, processes and outcomes of education delivery. The external panel of assessors comprised 50 subject area experts, students and industry representatives. LESSONS LEARNED AND ISSUES FOR FURTHER EXPLORATION The most welcome aspect of the EAE, and the clearest benefit of the project so far, was the opportunity to discuss educational quality matters, to form new networks and to identify strengths, weaknesses and ways forward. The project confirmed the strength of the enhancement approach as well as the importance of adapting evaluation methodology to local circumstances. Another lesson learned from the EAE was the importance of clarity regarding project aims. Above all, participants must have a clear picture of what the potential consequences, positive or negative, of the evaluation might be. Regardless of which approach is chosen, it needs to be well communicated and substantiated. A third lesson learned was that comprehensive evaluation projects of this type require a lot of time, energy and resources. In order to avoid evaluation fatigue and to get long-term benefits, it is important that the project dynamics are fed into a regular quality management system afterwards. The EAE project made clear reference to the national and the international policy context. Given the on-going transformation of the higher education sector, it will be an imperative task for KTH management to explore the new boundaries of autonomy and to work out future quality assurance strategies that suit internal needs as well as external expectations. In doing so, experiences from completing the EAE project will be of great value. Hopefully, sharing the experiences will be of value to other engineering education providers as well.","Autonomy; Enhancement; Evaluation; Leadership","Complex networks; Education; Engineering education; Image enhancement; Quality assurance; Quality management; Students; Autonomy; European Higher Education Area; Evaluation; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Leadership; Quality assurance strategies; Quality management systems; Royal Institute of Technology; Quality control","(2011) Quality Through Continuous Improvement - Quality Policy for KTH 2011-2015, , KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm; Kogan, M., Bauer, M., Bleiklie, I., Henkel, M., (2006) Transforming Higher Education - A Comparative Study, 13, pp. 166-167. , 2nd edition, Springer, Dordrecht, Higher Education Dynamics; (2010) Academia for This Day and Age, U10.016, Ministry of Education and Research, Stockholm, , March; Ds 2007:38.

Its purpose was to facilitate the election of the students' future university studies. Within the framework of this programme, a selection of first year High School students of Valencia (equivalent to grade 11 students) with majors in Science and Technology and excellent academic record, performed a small project within a research group at UPV, on some of the areas covered by the UPV Bachelor Engineering (BEng) degrees. The School of Industrial Design Engineering (ETSID) at UPV has participated in this first edition of Praktikum Campus by offering projects in the field of its different BEng degrees, all of them belonging to the ""Industrial and Aeronautics"" discipline [3]. Every morning, students performed their project (individually or in groups of 2-4 students) within a research group at ETSID and under the supervision of 1-2 teachers. Afterwards, each student filled an on-line blog in which they described the tasks they had been performing that day within their assigned project, the main results they had obtained, and their personal opinions and impressions about the programme [3]. Afternoons were devoted to other activities at UPV: in some of them, students could visit research laboratories and facilities at ETSID, while in other occasions, joint activities were organised with the rest of the students taking part in the Praktikum Campus programme, so that the exchange of experiences between all of them could be promoted. Finally, each student prepared a presentation summarising the main results of his/her research work that was later recorded on video and published in the UPV PoliTube channel [4]. In this paper, the development of the Praktikum Campus programme at ETSID has been analyzed, focusing on the participation rate and the satisfaction degree of the students taking part in this experience. In general, the ETSID participation in this initiative has been very satisfactory: 21% of the Praktikum Campus projects were carried out at ETSID, involving 21% of the students enrolled in this programme and 25% of the UPV teachers taking part in this initiative. These results indicate that, in this first edition of Praktikum Campus, ETSID has been the UPV School with the largest number of projects and participants (both students and teachers). On the other hand, results of the assessment survey that 71% of the students participating in Praktikum Campus filled the last day they attended the UPV, show that 94% of the students have valued very positively this initiative, 90% of the students would recommend this programme to their peers, and 91% of the students consider that this experience has contributed to help them to better understand the BEng degree related to the research work they had carried out. Furthermore, the analysis of the blog written by the students who attended ETSID during Praktikum Campus reveals that a great majority of them coincide in highlighting the key role of this initiative to help establish a first contact with UPV and the university in general, as well as to provide information on its BEng degrees, thus facilitating the election of their future university studies.

For years there has been a one-dimensional direction in curriculum of technological and pedagogical educational institutes where the main objective was to develop technical skills directly applicable to production. Many courses try to sense the demands of market and follow the progress of technology. In the recent years, technological educational institutes managed to turn the gaze also towards basic research. This is due mainly to the increased opportunities for foundations by National and European programmes for research. Through these financial supports the existence laboratories equipment can be upgraded and in some cases totally replaced. At the same time, through these updated laboratories it becomes possible for the new ambitious researchers not only to undertake and complete innovative ideas but also to put forward and organize new updated courses and new applied specializations in a high master's level. The need for organization of new specialized programs that would be suited to the requirements of modern objects has appeared and then institutions that wish to become leaders to evolutions have to face major difficulties. Then, a critical enquiry arises: which will be the role of an educational engineering laboratory during the final stage of completion of the postgraduate studies of an already graduated student with his/her thesis. In the example that will be given here, the experience of our department will be presented. The design and growth of a formally educational engineering laboratory in order to meet the needs of postgraduate studies and research of students will be explained. The student then has in availability a large amount of devices and parameters that he/she can choose to engage with, during the planning of his/her research study. With the help and the guidance of his/her advisor a student can schedule by him/herself the management of his/her project. As a result of the abovementioned procedure the role of a formally educational laboratory turns to a research one, and then transforms again to an educational tool where each student can obtain a total knowledge not only of the devices that he/she has operated him/herself, but mainly by understanding the majority of the concepts that he/she has dealt with.","Dissertation; Engineering laboratories; Research; Thesis","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Laboratories; Research; Research laboratories; Teaching; Dissertation; Educational engineering; Educational Institutes; Educational laboratory; Engineering laboratories; Postgraduate studies; Thesis; Undergraduate engineering educations; Students","Jonassen, D., Strobel, J., Lee, C.B., Everyday problem solving in engineering: Lessons for engineering educators (2006) Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 139-151. , vol April 2006; Bidanda, B., Billo, R.E., On the use of students for developing engineering laboratories (1995) Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 205-213. , vol April 1995; Kukreti, A.R., Teaching analysis of structures using a small-scale structural behaviour laboratory (1998) Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 215-217. , vol.

MIT contributed to the development of SUTD's undergraduate curriculum, and, as part of that effort, MIT's Teaching and Learning Laboratory (TLL) identified pivotal concepts and critical skills from what is called SUTD's ""freshmore year,"" which encompasses the first three semesters of the students' course of study. The goal of identifying pivotal concepts and critical skills was to see how they supported learning throughout the SUTD curriculum, generally, and, specifically, how they were connected across disciplines. Using a ""constructive alignment"" process advocated by John Biggs and Catherine Tang, who recommend beginning the construction of a curriculum with intended learning outcomes, and a process for ""clarifying content priorities"" advocated by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, we began the difficult task of identifying pivotal concepts and critical skills. We were fortunate in that faculty and instructional staff from MIT had already begun the process of defining SUTD's curriculum. Most of the courses in the freshmore year already had a number of intended learning outcomes associated with them. By considering what concepts and skills would support these intended learning outcomes, concepts considered to be truly interdisciplinary according to the literature on integrated curricula, and concepts documented to be problematic for students in the literature on student misconceptions and misunderstandings, we began to refine our list of pivotal concepts and critical skills. In the end, a concept or skill was identified as pivotal when it satisfied one of two criteria: (1) it was prerequisite for multiple concepts that would be taught in upper-level courses; or (2) it was pervasive across disciplines. The result of this process was an Engineering Curriculum Map (the ""Map""), which diagrams, for both faculty and students, the crucial ideas and capabilities SUTD students should master in their first three semesters. The Map also visually represents the interdisciplinary connections among concepts that may otherwise appear to be from disparate disciplines (e.g., physics, math, biology, chemistry). After the Map was developed, it guided the creation of a set of 15-minute videos narrated by MIT faculty and graduate students, called ""concept vignettes,"" which contribute to the curricular materials available to SUTD. These videos teach pivotal concepts and critical skills by utilizing animations, visualizations, and/or demonstrations. The intention of the Map and concept vignettes is to provide students with a coherent educational framework by bringing pivotal concepts to the forefront of the learning experience. We hope the Engineering Curriculum Map will be of interest to curriculum developers, department chairs, and professors of both introductory and more advanced engineering courses. By highlighting pivotal concepts that reappear throughout the curriculum, our goal is to help instructors and faculty provide additional opportunities for students to revisit these concepts within their courses.","Concept map; Curriculum development; Educational video; Interdisciplinary engineering concepts","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Mapping; Teaching; Concept maps; Constructive alignments; Curriculum development; Educational videos; Engineering concepts; Intended learning outcomes; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Undergraduate curricula; Students","Adams, R., Multiple perspectives on engaging future engineers (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 48-88; Crawley, E., Malmqvist, J., Ostlund, S., Brodeur, D., (2007) Rethinking Engineering Education: The CDIO Approach, , Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, New York, NY; National Academy of Engineering, (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , National Academies Press, Washington, D.

The more involved and engaged the student is with the program, the greater his or her level of knowledge acquisition and general cognitive development [1]. Another important finding that is emerging from current engineering education literature is the value of successful group collaboration project work for students' personal and academic development. Such activities tend to maximise all the group members' learning outcomes and have been shown to promote higher individual achievement than competitive or individualistic approaches [1]. This paper describes an initiative that was undertaken to promote student engagement and improve learning outcomes in two new core undergraduate engineering mechanics courses at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC). A set of low cost, hands-on, interactive models were developed for students to use in small groups that demonstrated the underlying theory and helped them to better understand the basic engineering mechanics principles. Engineering Statics and Mechanics of Materials are foundation engineering courses that are traditionally regarded by many students as conceptually difficult and overly theoretical. Engineering students often experience substantial difficulties with foundation mechanics courses and it is widely noted in the literature that pass rates in typical foundation mechanics courses tend to be unacceptably low [8,9,10]. It has been shown that poor performance in these early engineering courses causes many students to lose confidence in their abilities and to consequently drop out of engineering programs. A literature review was undertaken to identify successful teaching approaches that have been used to improving student learning outcomes in foundation engineering courses. The review findings suggested that a more effective teaching strategy would be to move away from the typically over-complicated text book approach to introducing relevant theory, and to simplify the concepts by using real-world examples that students can relate to. The use of simple, hands-on interactive models and activities to demonstrate real-world concepts makes learning interesting and enjoyable for the students. The practical hands-on, interactive models were designed as real-world, authentic examples to demonstrate the underlying theory and principles in a way that students can relate to, and is easy for them to understand. Students were observed to fully engage with the new practicals and they found them interesting and enjoyable. A range of evaluation methods were used to gauge the effectiveness of the new practicals in achieving increased student engagement, including classroom observation, standard course evaluation instruments, student surveys and analysis of assessment results. Although the new practicals were clearly successful in improving the level of student engagement, teamwork and understanding, it is difficult to make any substantial claims on the pedagogical benefits of using the hands-on, interactive models due to a lack of reliable evidence. However, the final grades for students in both courses were substantially better than typical results presented in the literature for similar foundation mechanics courses. A comparison of student pass rates for the two new USC courses demonstrated that the pass rates were higher than those achieved in similar international foundation engineering courses. Although these results are very encouraging, there is as yet, still insufficient evidence available to make any substantial claims on the pedagogical benefits of using the hands-on, interactive models. However, the degree of student engagement and involvement while undertaking the practicals was clearly evident. This paper illustrates that with a few materials and a little imagination, engineering practicals can be designed to promote more engaging and rewarding student learning experiences.","Group collaboration; Student engagement; Teamwork","Artificial intelligence; Cost engineering; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Foundations; Mechanics; Reviews; Teaching; Technical presentations; Active learning principles; Group collaboration; Mechanics of materials; Student engagement; Student learning experiences; Student learning outcomes; Teamwork; Undergraduate engineering; Students","Smith, K.A., Johnson, D.W., Johnson, R.W., Sheppard, S.D., Pedagogies of engagement: Classroom-Based Practices (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 1-15; Bonwell, C.C., Eison, J.A., (1991) Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom, , Washington DC: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education; Ditcher, A., Effective teaching and learning in higher education, with particular reference to the undergraduate education of professional engineers (2001) International Journal of Engineering Education, 17 (1), pp. 24-29; Mills, J.E., Treagust, D.F., (2003) Engineering Education - Is Problem-based Or Projectbased Learning the Answer?, , http://www.aaee.com.au/journal/2003/mills_treagust03.pdf, Australasian Journal of Engineering Education; Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., The role of the laboratory in undergraduate engineering education (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 121-130; Maiorana, C., Sgarbossa, L., Salomoni, V., New methodologies in teaching estructural mechanics using WWW (2008) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 16, pp. 189-210; Abdel-Salam, T., Kauffman, P.J., Crossman, G., Does the lack of hands-on experience in a remotely delivered laboratory course affect student learning?

One of the features of the curriculum implementation is that courses' contact hours are not divided in several types of classes, as in traditional learning environments. Following an idea adapted from the Aalborg model [2], all courses are taught in four-hour blocks that can be organized differently according to the course, or the learning needs at any stage of the process, thus enhancing flexibility and allowing for reorganization of the provision for teaching according to students' needs. This format was also meant to encourage the adoption of active learning strategies within the classroom, since traditional lectures in such a format would be little less than excruciating. This article describes an investigation into the ""on the field"" experience of both students and teachers with these four-hour blocks. The research questions were: How are four-hour classes being implemented ""on the field""? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this format? Does the format actually foster the implementation of active learning strategies? Discussion sessions were organized for three groups of students, one for each of the academic years of the Electrical Engineering program, with the goal of identifying the various categories of four-hour classes to which they have been exposed so far. Each group of students elected a ""secretary"" and were left alone to discuss for about twenty minutes, after which the Author re-entered the room and discussed with the students any issues in need of clarification. Afterwards, each of the participating students was asked to list, in writing, the three most positive and the three least positive aspects of each of the blocks' categories identified earlier [3]. All teachers involved in the program were also asked to list, in writing, the three most positive and the three least positive aspects of teaching in four-hour blocks. The results of the discussion sessions and the lists, from both students and teachers, were qualitatively analysed to answer the research questions. The results of the investigation show that students identify four categories of classes, ranging from more traditional approaches, to very engaging active-learning organized sessions, namely: ""Full lecture"", ""Traditional layout"", ""Tutorial-like organisation"" and ""Active learning sessions"". From the analysis of the results presented in the article, it is possible to hint that the four-hour format pressures teachers to engage in less traditionally organized classes. Students also value more engaging learning environments, which are fostered by this format of classes. This trend becomes more apparent for students in more advanced stages of the programme, which may reflect their greater exposure to the PBL environment and also their increased maturity. However, students also value the formal structure provided by more traditional environments, possibly a consequence of their previous learning experiences and study habits. Naturally, further research into these findings is needed in order to get a better grasp of the dynamics of four-hour blocks and their role in ESTGA's PBL environment. The results of this study will guide that research, establishing the general lines on which to pursue further enquiries.","Active learning; Project-based learning","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Students; Active Learning; Active learning strategies; Curriculum implementation; Electrical engineering programs; Learning environments; Project based learning; Traditional approaches; Traditional learning; Teaching","Oliveira, J.M., Estima De Oliveira, J.P., Project-based learning in engineering: An actual case (2009) Proc. of the 37th SEFI Annual Conference (CD, , Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Kjersdam, F., Enemark, S., (1994) The Aalborg Experiment, Project Innovation in University Education, , The University of Aalborg Press, Aalborg; Savin-Baden, M., (2000) Problem-based Learning in Higher Education: Untold Stories, , SRHE & Open University Press, Buckingham; Boud, D., Feletti, G., (1991) The Challenge of Problem-based Learning, , Kogan Page, London; Cowan, J., (1987) Education for Capability in Engineering Education, , Thesis for the degree of DEng, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh; Fallows, S., Steven, C., (2000) Integrating Key Skills in Higher Education: Employability, Transferable Skills and Learning for Life, , Kogan Page, London; Oliveira, J.M., Project based learning in engineering: The águeda experience (2006) Management of Change - Implementation of Problem-based and Project-based Learning in Engineering, , edited by Graaff and Kolmos, Sense Publishers, Rotterdam/Taipei; Felder, R.M., Brent, R., Active learning: An introduction (2009) ASQ Higher Education Brief, 2 (4); Prince, M., Does active learning work?

Referring to this, the students' increasingly diverse range of levels and types of qualifications and their continuing deterioration of mathematical competencies are often referred to as one of the major challenges [1,2,3]. More critical concerns stem from the fact that the initial phase usually comprises lectures requiring mathematical expertise which in some cases clearly goes beyond school mathematics, but will be presented only later in mathematical courses. Taking into account that the first year is critical for student success [2] and to avoid high dropout rates, revised concepts for teaching engineering mathematics in respect to individual students' demands are required. Furthermore, overloaded schedules [4] lead to the conclusion that students would not engage in additional uncoupled academic programs in regard to mathematics. In this article, a new generalizable concept to address the above mentioned challenges withinundergraduate engineering courses is introduced by way of example in a Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering lecture. MATHEMATICAL ISSUES: In order to get an overview of particularly difficult subjects students have to cope with in terms of the course contents and allowing for a more effective teaching of mathematics within the course, a questionnaire was developed and given to the students at the end of the course semester. The first step in this regard was a detailed analysis and preparation of an appropriate summary of mathematical subjects appearing in the course. Within the scope of the evaluation it was found that three different classes of levels of difficulty can be derived and the proposed approach mostly covers the subjects which have been evaluated as particularly difficult by the students. Therefore, a survey concerning students' difficulties in respect to specific mathematical subjects in the context of the course is presented, a field for which investigations hardly exist. SITUATED MATHEMATICS TEACHING: The proposed approach focuses on gaining mathematical competencies in the situated context of a specialist subject and comprises an adaption of the course and the implementation of a complementary blended learning scenario including a web-based learning platform. Common exigencies in regard to a convenient design for interventions from the theory of situated cognition [5] were considered, where learning is contemplated as an active, constructivist process that is directly linked to and enhanced by a specific context. The concept is discussed in regard to related measures as well as pedagogical foundations and corresponding research questions are addressed. CONCLUSION: In summary, due to the fact that related previous interventions have been applied successfully for years, it was depicted that revised concepts for teaching engineering mathematics can be realized by implementing proven, existing pedagogy. Thereby, a detailed analysis of mathematical subjects appearing in the course, the utilization of multimedia elements and a close interlocking of the course elements are important aspects of the concept.","E-learning; Situated learning; Teaching electrical engineering; Undergraduate engineering mathematics","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Technical presentations; Electrical engineering course; Engineering mathematics; Mathematical knowledge; Mathematics teachings; Situated learning; Undergraduate engineering; Undergraduate engineering students; Web-based learning platforms; Teaching","Mustoe, L., Coming to terms with change: Mathematics for engineering undergraduates (2006) Proc. of the 13th European Seminar on Mathematics in Engineering Education, pp. 29-38. , Buskerud University College, Kongsberg, Norway; Bamforth, S.E., Robinson, C.L., Croft, T., Crawford, A., Retention and progression of engineering students with diverse mathematical backgrounds (2007) Teaching Mathematics and its Applications, 26 (4), pp. 156-166; Engineering Council, (2000) Measuring the Mathematics Problem, , Engineering Council, London, Technical report; Litzinger, T.A., Wise, J.C., Lee, S.H., Self-directed learning readiness among engineering undergraduate students (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (2), pp. 215-221; Luk, H.S., The gap between secondary school and university mathematics (2005) International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology, 36 (2-3), pp. 161-174; Mills, P., Georgakis, P., Analysis of a diagnostic and support programme for improved learning of Civil Engineering students (2010) Proc. of the Engineering Education Conference, , Aston University, Birmingham, England; Ida, N., (2004) Engineering Electromagnetics, , 2nd Edition, Springer Verlag, New York; Kumar, S., Jalkio, J.A., Teaching mathematics from an applications perspective (1999) Journal of Engineering Education, 88 (3), pp. 275-279; Mustoe, L., Lawson, D., Mathematics for the european engineer - A curriculum for the twenty-first century (2002) SEFI Working Group on Mathematics, , SEFI HQ, Brussels, Belgium, Technical report; Biehler, R., Hochmuth, R., Fischer, P., Wassong, T., Remedial scenarios for online and blended learning bridging courses (2012) Proc. of the 7th Congress of the European Society for Research in Mathematics Education, , Rzeszow, Poland; Lawson, D., Croft, A.C., Carpenter, S.L., Mathematics support real, virtual and mobile (2008) The International Journal for Technology in Mathematics Education, 15 (2), pp. 73-78; Edwards, P., Edwards, P.M., Tackling the mathematics problem with MathinSite (2003) Global Journal of Engineering Education, 7 (1), pp. 95-102; Korenko, B., Cervenova, J., Janicek, F., Teaching of electromagnetism using e-courses (2010) Proc. of the Joint International IGIP-SEFI Annual Conference, , Trnava, Slovakia; Tetour, Y., Richter, T., Boehringer, D., Integration of virtual and remote experiments into undergraduate engineering courses (2010) Proc. of the Joint International IGIP-SEFI Annual Conference, , Trnava, Slovakia; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18 (1), pp. 32-42; McCartan, C.D., Hermon, J.P., Cunningham, G., A model to sustain engineering mathematics learning in a cdio environment (2010) Proc. of the 6th International CDIO Conference, , École Polytechnique, Montréal, Canada","Hennig, M.; University of PaderbornGermany",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

This relatively new School of Engineering awarded the first engineering degrees in May 2005. The School of Engineering has produced over 270 B.S. graduates and 150 M.S. graduates from 2005 thru May 2011. This paper examines the gender composition of our student body at JSU School of Engineering from various aspects including female total enrollment, female freshman enrollment, percentage of BS awarded to females and compares to data for all HBCU's and all US engineering programs. Female engineering percent of enrollment nationwide increased about 1.3% from 2005 to 2011 while it decreased significantly at HBCU's (about 2.7%) and at JSU (about 8.2%). Freshmen female percent of engineering enrollment increased about 2.2% nationally while it decreased 3.7% at HBCUs and 12.5% at JSU. The percent of engineering BS degrees awarded to female decreased about 1.1% nationwide, about 5.7% at HBCU's and about 9.2% at JSU. [1] In terms of absolute engineering enrollment, freshman enrollment and BS degrees awarded at JSU, all increased from 2004-05 through the 2011-2012 academic year. The male enrollment, freshmen enrollment and BS degrees awarded all increased substantially more that female characteristics at JSU. These observations created sufficient concern leading to further detailed analyses of the trends in mathematics preparedness (ACT math scores) of our female first time freshman, female retention rates and female graduation rates relative to their male counterparts. From 2001 to 2011, female and male first time freshmen average ACT math scores shows a very large increase and should have a positive effect on future graduation rates if average ACT scores for first time freshmen continue to increase as indicated by this ten year trend. We detect no discernable difference in retention rates for female and male school of engineering students. Analysis on graduation rate indicates that female students' graduation rates are equal or slightly higher than their male counter parts, while being highly correlated with ACT math scores. JSU School of Engineering has decided embark on an aggressive plan to be finalized in a participatory manner to enhance the present of female first time freshmen, percent of female transfer students, percent of female graduates. Strategies includes visits to metropolitan Jackson area (and surrounding counties) high schools by female alumni and student for recruiting, Summer Enhancement Program for incoming freshman focusing on math and expanding our evening engineering classes, online classes and partnerships with local Community Colleges taught by female faculties.","Enrollment; Gender; Graduation; Retention","Education; Students; Absolute engineerings; Engineering enrollments; Enrollment; Gender; Graduation; Retention; School of engineering; Telecommunications engineerings; Engineering education","E ngineering Data Management System, American Society for Engineering Education, , http://edms.asee.org; Whalin, R.W., Pang, Q., Summer enrichment program to enhance retention (2011) ASEE Southeast Section Conference, , Charleston, South Carolina, April; Whalin, R.W., Pang, Q., Preliminary assessment of summer enrichment program (2012) ASEE Southeast Section Conference, , Starkville, MS, April","Pang, Q.; Center for Defence Integrated Data, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State UniversityUnited States",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

As universities are competing ewith each other, the environment in which they function is laid more and more importance on but at the same time costs are cut because of change in university fundings. Facilities managers of universities have to rethink the ways of making the existing space use more efficient, more meaningful and less costly. They have to focus on supporting the core functions. The core of university consist on researching, teaching and learning. Learning is the main function inside each of the areas mentioned and therefore it can be said to be the very core business. Learning can be identified to take place in various settings and forms. Facilities of a University should support the myriad of purposes. Three key development directions supporting each other have been identified as: [1] New ways of learning, [2] increasement of virtuality and embedded learning environments and [3] need for multi-functional spaces. Facilities management can be considered as a service provided by the university for a customer. Therefore, it should respond to the needs of the whole learning landscape by providing [1] new space types, [2] holistic virtual and physical systems in various social contexts and [3] appealing spaces that are flexible in terms of spatial layout and services. To find out the problems between facilities management practices and the development in learning landscapes, Aalto University is taken as a case example to be analysed in this paper from functional and strategic aspects. Aalto University is an interesting example because it merged in 2010 from three traditional Finnish universities representing fields of art, science and technology and economics with the aim of creating synergies through interdisciplinary collaboration resulting in innovations in a longer perspective. Combining all the functions, creating a cross-disciplinary atmosphere, encouraging people to collaborate and creating consistent facilities management practices to support those actions will be a huge task for the young, ambitious organisation but also a possibility of creating something totally unique. As a result, a proposal of how to make the FM more efficient and meaningful is provided. The methodology of the study is based on an analysis of Aalto's space resources from functional and strategic aspects. The main findings include: [1] the space types are too divergent by nature [2] physical environment management is not enough but the practices should be widened to take into account the wider perspective of virtuality and community and [3] managing the spaces has become a disconnected entity and customer value has not been the driver as it should be.","Campus development; Future trends; Learning environments; Real estate management","Compensation (personnel); Computer aided instruction; Education; Environmental management; Office buildings; Societies and institutions; Campus development; Development directions; Future trends; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Learning environments; Physical environments; Real estate managements; Science and Technology; Engineering education","Aalto University, (2011) Campusvision, , https://inside.aalto.fi/display/aallosta/Kampusvisio, Feb, Retrieved 2011 25-Sept from Aalto Inside; Aalto University, (2011) Campusvision, , https://inside.aalto.fi/display/aallosta/Kampusvisio, June, Retrieved 2011 19-Sept from Aalto Inside; Aalto Facility Services, (2011) Aalto University Space Resource Database (created by Ramboll), , Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland; Aalto-www, (2011) Statistics of Aalto, , http://www.aalto.fi/en/about/statistics, 1-July, Retrieved 2011 13-10 from Aalto; Aalto-www, (2011) Campuses, , http://www.aalto.fi/en/about/campuses/technology, 27-June, Retrieved 2011 14-Oct.from Aalto University; De Jonge, H., (1997) ""Trends in Corporate Real Estate"".

The development of engineering education is facilitated by a basic understanding of pedagogical theories, but also by the recognition of, and connections to, more recognizable engineering traditions. The use of illustrative models to explain and simplify complex pedagogical processes is an example of how a scientific tradition familiar to engineering teachers could help them increase their understanding of teaching and learning, and serve as a driver for the development of engineering education. In this conceptual paper we present and analyse a model for pedagogical competence, integrating theory and practice in engineering education [1]. The model involves four essential parts - pedagogical practiceor actual teaching activities related to student learning; observationof teaching and student learning; theoryor theoretical knowledge of teaching and student learning; and planningas a means for improved pedagogical practice. The pedagogical practice involves a variety of teaching activities and it is within the pedagogical practice that student learning is actively supported through interactions between teachers and students. We identify the qualitative level of the pedagogical practice as teaching skills. Pedagogical competence is a broader concept than teaching skills. A professional teacher should continuously observe and reflect on the teaching practice and its effect on student learning. Based on theoretical knowledge, and own observations of teaching and learning, the teacher analyses his or her teaching practice in relation to students' learning and draw rational conclusions and make plans for continued development. Our arguments are related to the theory of cognitive dissonancedeveloped by Festinger [2]. In the case of teaching and learning an important dissonance may be between a teacher's knowledge about teaching and learning and the actual teaching practice and its outcomes. Festinger argues that the tension between conflicting cognitions, the dissonance, is a driving force for change since people want to reduce or eliminate dissonance and achieve consonance, and we argue for teachers' own observations to be the single most important factor to disclose dissonance. Reflection is an essential characteristic of scholarly teaching and integrated in all parts of our model. Mezirow [3] discusses increasingly complex ways of reflection: contentreflection, processreflection and premisereflection. Process and premise reflection increase the possibilities for teachers to transform their conceptual structures to become more complex. We argue that to reflect beyond content reflection it is necessary to go outside the pedagogical practice and include observation, theory and planning. We also build on Argyris and Schön [4]. A very important feature in double-loop learning is the ability to draw conclusions from data, something consistent with the use of observations as exposed in our model. Teachers that teach without observing teaching and student learning, and without reflecting with the use of pedagogical theory, are likely to learn only through single-loop learning. Teachers that demonstrate pedagogical competence are much more likely to produce double-loop learning. The Faculty of Engineering at Lund University has an extensive and integrated program for academic development. In addition to this program, a formal research subject, engineering education, was introduced in 2011. The core activities of the academic development program comprise pedagogical courses at university level; consulting services; evaluations; applied research related to engineering education, dissemination of knowledge and arenas for scholarly conversations; and, a system for rewarding excellent teaching. The model of pedagogical competence is used in analyses of our ideas about academic development and we will discuss some practical results and implications at our presentation of the paper.","Cognitive dissonance; Critical reflection; Double-loop learning; Engineering education","Curricula; Driver training; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Information services; Students; Cognitive dissonance; Conceptual structures; Critical reflections; Development programs; Double-loop learning; Essential characteristic; Pedagogical practices; Teaching and learning; Teaching","Olsson, T., Mårtensson, K., Roxå, T., Pedagogical competence - A development perspective from Lund University (2010) A Swedish Perspective on Pedagogical Competence, pp. 121-132. , Å.

CSR is also gaining attention within Higher Education, being related to a wide range of activities taking place at universities, especially the environmental dimension [2]. Apart from the issue of Social Responsibility within the institution, its role in the curricula of the different degree programmes also needs to be discussed. The University of Coru a (Spain), the University of Minho (Portugal), the University of Guanajuato (Mexico) and the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes (Mexico) started, in 2012, a research project focused on students', teachers' and university managers' representations regarding the concept and practices of Social Responsibility in Higher Education. At student and teacher level, the focus is on the role of Corporate Social Responsibility in the curriculum and seeks to answer questions on if and how students are prepared to assume an active role in social, economical and environmental responsibility in their future professional career. As a first step in this exploratory project, focus groups were held with students from all four participating universities. The current study takes part of a broader international research project, involving three countries and four different universities (1 Portuguese, 1 Spanish and 2 Mexican). The research project focuses on the representations of three main actors in the university setting regarding the concept and practices of academic social responsibility: (i) the students, (ii) teachers; and (iii) the university administrators. The sessions lasted between 25 and 63 minutes. In each focus group, around 7 students participated. This study was intended as the first step in an exploratory study on Social Responsibility in Higher Education, trying to identify perceptions and opinions of students. Although they do not have a single definition of Social Responsibility, most students are familiar with the concept and know one or more examples, especially after a short introduction of the focus group moderators. They consider it important, both inside as well as outside university, but have second thoughts on the motives for companies to be engaged in initiatives that show Social Responsibility. They suspect that those motives are not in accordance with the deeper meaning of Social Responsibility and suspect companies to work first and foremost on their own benefits. Looking at the contexts of the study, Spain, Portugal and Mexico, a difference in focus can be distinguished. The Iberian students appear to be more worried about ecological and economical issues at a personal level, whereas the Mexican students are more focused on the social dimension of Social Responsibility and take into account a wider context when for example referring to Social Responsibility and nature disasters. As an exploratory step, the study has proven to be useful to the researchers involved. The meaning of Social responsibility to students, its role in their daily life and their professional future and the role of university are varying widely in the different contexts involved in the study.

Despite a consistent interest in interdisciplinarity in education in the last decades, there are still conceptual inconsistencies and confusion surrounding the term. It is the integrative aspect, which is at the heart of interdisciplinarity, denoting the synergetic interaction between specific disciplinary perspectives. However, current university structures inhibit the integration of multiple disciplinary perspectives into a more comprehensive approach to problem solving. Meanwhile, the industry is increasingly in demand of graduates with strong interdisciplinary skills. The present paper is guided by the following research question: What are the implications of interdisciplinarity for engineering education, and how would an enhanced interdisciplinary thinking influence curriculum planning? The present study points at the development of cross-disciplinary collaboration skills in real-life settings as instrumental to building interdisciplinary competence. The various forms of problem and project based learning practices employed in many engineering educational settings may include an interdisciplinary dimension, which is though often challenged by current university structures and traditional disciplinary boundaries. Consequently, collaboration is limited to working in homogeneous groups on mutually agreed projects, with little scope for developing crossdisciplinary collaborative skills, i.e. the ability to negotiate conflicts, integrate expertise from related fields, and produce flexible, innovative solutions - all of which qualify students to work in the type of independent, interdisciplinary project teams, increasingly in demand by industry. Our aim is to raise awareness of this gap and suggest a framework for integrating interdisciplinary collaboration competencies into existing problem and project based learning curricula. The data in this paper originates from the setting of an annually recurring, three-day-long digital building workshop, ""Digital Days"" (henceforth DD), that brings together industry specialists, university and vocational training staff, as well as exponents of the entire range of professionals populating a building site. Students and trainees engage collaboratively on a common digitalized design platform, the Building Information Modeling (BIM) method. BIM design tools allow for extracting different though automatically consistent views from a building model for various uses enhancing the integration of the design process. Being the meeting point, building models facilitate the coordination and collaboration between parties. BIM alters the cross-disciplinary approach used in the industry today, since it is only possible if the processes are iterative, and disciplinary contributions are continuously being merged into the project. BIM both requires and supports interdisciplinary collaboration and it is therefore suggested as a means to include interdisciplinarity in engineering programs. One of the salient features in our findings was the aspect of collaboration between participants from the various disciplines, who not only benefited from working in a team, but also from the process of negotiating solutions with concurrent teams. Participants mobilized communicative skills in order to uncover each other's ""ways of thinking and practicing"" and the underlying principles of specific disciplinary methods in order to distill the problem solving approach. Moreover, the students gained more confidence in approaching problems. The experimental learning climate boosted participants' spirit of inquiry and freedom to advance viable solutions to the open-ended problem. The dynamic social milieu promoted mutual commitment and motivation to comply with the constraints of a product oriented approach, where interdisciplinary collaboration was instrumental to project work. Regarding the interdisciplinary objective in problem and project-based learning models employed in engineering education, our findings suggest that there may be further scope for interdisciplinary collaboration, at both intra-departmental and faculty level, and the wider social context including the industry. Socially facilitated learning environments created by real-life problem scenarios and the coexistence of diverse disciplinary perspectives are seen as main qualifiers for students engaging actively in interdisciplinary project teams. In order to promote the development of interdisciplinary collaboration skills among engineering students, the interdisciplinary competence has to be explicitly acknowledged as a learning goal in the educational program. Besides the formal, curriculum level, a framework for integrating the development of interdisciplinary competence in engineering education should involve the organizational and instructional levels, i.e. explicit ways of organizing interdisciplinary learning opportunities, as well as the competence development level, i.e. equipping staff with the required insight and tools to facilitate students' learning processes.","Collaboration; Interdisciplinarity; Problem and project based learning","Architectural design; Buildings; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Iterative methods; Personnel training; Problem solving; Product design; Building Information Model - BIM; Collaboration; Cross-disciplinary approaches; Cross-disciplinary collaborations; Interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Interdisciplinary competence; Problem- and project-based learning; Students","Barrie, S., A conceptual framework for the teaching and learning of generic graduate attributes (2007) Studies in Higher Education, 32 (4), pp. 439-458; Beddoes, K., Borrego, M., Facilitating an integrated graduate research team in a complex interdisciplinary domain (2011) Preliminary Findings.

MIT is currently collaborating with the government of Singapore in the development of the new Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). SUTD is a new engineering-oriented university that opened its doors to the first student cohort of approximately 320 students on May 7, 2012. To date, the MIT-SUTD Collaboration is the most holistic transplantation venture that MIT has undertaken. Through this collaboration, the MIT team has attempted to bridge cultural differences and transfuse the MIT academic culture by three different avenues. MIT is proceeding with the SUTD development by focusing on (i) collaborative curriculum development, (ii) an immersive professional development program for new faculty, and (iii) support systems for students' co-curricular development. The team's effort towards transfusing the student culture through the avenue of co-curricular development is further discussed in this paper. In recent years, the impact of out-of-class experiences-especially co-curricular activities-has been studied at length in the higher education literature. As Kuh observes, ""Most scholars who study the impact of college on students agree that what happens outside the classroom - the other curriculum - can contribute to valued outcomes of college"" [1]. In addition, interaction with older student cohorts is considered to be a very influential factor in the establishment of student identity and student culture in any college or university environment. In its inaugural year, SUTD does not have a pre-existing student cohort or a pre-existing culture of campus life. The MIT team used of this lack of prior SUTD cohorts as a vehicle to enable diffusion of the MIT student culture and attitude to the newcoming SUTD students. To accomplish this task, the MIT team - in collaboration with the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program - initiated a new program called the MISTI Singapore Leadership Initiative (MISTI-SLI). Through the MISTI-SLI program, eighteen MIT students have traveled to Singapore in the summer of 2012 to act as the ""older cohort"" to freshman SUTD students. These MIT students are mentoring and aiding the SUTD freshmen in creating co-curricular activities and campus life initiatives at the new university, in addition to participating in full-time internships related to their studies at MIT. To prepare the MIT students for this cross-cultural experience, the MISTI-SLI coordinating team developed a pre-departure training curriculum for the MISTI-SLI program participants focused on Singaporean cultural issues and history, background of the MIT-SUTD collaboration project, and topics in leadership relevant to their work with the new students at SUTD. The cultural components of this curriculum were developed based on Parkinson's ""Best Practices for Engineering Study Abroad Programs"" [2], while the leadership components were developed based on Komives and Wagner's Social Change Model (SCM) for leadership development [3]. This leadership model was selected based on its changefocused nature; the MISTI-SLI participants and first SUTD student cohort have the opportunity to create a student environment unique in the Singaporean educational context, and a process, value-based system of change is optimal for this type of rapid and creative development. This paper presents the curriculum developed for the MIT students by the MIT-SUTD Collaboration office as well as the rationale behind the choices made in creating this leadership program for the 2012 MISTI-SLI participants. The leadership training model proposed for the MISTI-SLI program is one possible vehicle to train students for cross-cultural leadership exchange experiences; however, the results of this effort will remain uncertain until years after the MIT students depart from Singapore and the student culture at SUTD can be observed.","Engineering leadership curriculum; Internships; Transfusion of culture; University development","Amphibious vehicles; Crashworthiness; Curricula; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; History; Personnel training; Teaching; Co-curricular activities; Collaboration projects; Engineering leadership; International collaborations; Internships; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Professional development program; University development; Students","Kuh, G.D., The other curriculum: Out-of-class experiences associated with student learning and personal development (2012) The Journal of Higher Education, 66 (2), pp. 123-155; Strauss, L.C., Terenzini, P.T., The effects of students' in- and out-of-class experiences on their analytical and group skills: A study of engineering education (2007) Research in Higher Education, 48 (8), pp. 967-992; Terenzini, P.T., Springer, L., Pascarella, E.T., Nora, A., Influences affecting the development of students' critical thinking skills (1995) Research in Higher Education, 36 (1), pp. 23-39; ESN International, What is ESN?, http://esn.org/content/what-esn; Kuroda, K., International student mobility for East Asian integration (2011) East-West Center Education 2020 Leadership Institute; Parkinson, A., Engineering study abroad programs: Formats, challenges, best practices (2007) Online Journal for Global Engineering Education, 2 (2); Rompelman, O., De Vries, J., Practical training and internships in engineering education: Educational goals and assessment (2002) European Journal of Engineering Education, 27 (2), pp. 173-180; Board of European Students of Technology, (2012) Education, , http://best.eu.org/student/education/index.jsp; Komives, S.R., Wagner, W., Associates, (2009) Leadership for a Better World: Understanding the Social Change Model of Leadership Development, pp. xi-xxi. , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., San Francisco","Fisher, D.; MIT-SUTD Collaboration, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyUnited States",,9782873520052,,"English","Proc.

In parallel to that, the advent of Internet, which allows for a plethora of educational content to be widely shared, seems to be promoting self-directed learning for all ages. Furthermore the rapid technological advancement makes obvious the need to identify opportune times and methods for technology and computer education, starting probably from the very early ages [3] and [4]. This paper presents improvement suggestions after children and teachers piloted a self-teaching programming using an interactive application developed by our research group. The application presents a curriculum that introduces fundamental programming concepts and algorithmic thinking to early elementary school students. The teaching approach is based on parallel use of the self-teaching application, and use of the ""Scratch"" platform that allows for interaction and experimentation with fundamental but also more advanced programming concepts [5]. The application is interactive, and in parallel with teaching, offers the students developmentally appropriate rubrics for self-assessment [6]. The curriculum proposed, consists of 10 educational modules that address fundamental programming concepts, namely the concepts of algorithmic thinking, well-structured problem solving, assignment of variables, creating of logic diagrams, use of sequential, conditional and repeated instructions, testing and debugging. Every educational module consists of an audiovisual introduction to a game scenario and the Scratch modules the children will need to use, one step-by step solution to the problem, and introduction to a similar game scenario that addresses the same programming concepts as the initial scenario, a self-assessment rubric for the child to use, that again uses developmentally appropriate form of questions and visual elements and requires Yes/No answers. The application was initially developed and piloted as an afterschool activity by 12 3rd graders in an elementary school in Greece [2]. Following that, two 3rd grade teachers also implemented the application in class during regular class hours.","Early education; Problem-solving; Self-assessment rubrics; Self-teaching programming curriculum","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Program debugging; Students; Teaching; Interactive applications; Programming concepts; Self assessment; Self-directed learning; Teaching applications; Teaching programming; Technological advancement; Testing and debugging; Problem solving","Kosmopoulou, I., Florou, C., Bagiati, A., Houstis, E., Developing an interactive autodidactic platform for elementary school programming, based on Scratch and self-assessment rubrics (2010) Proceedings of the 5th Pan-hellenic Conference on Computer Science Didactics, Held April 9-11, 2010 in Athens, pp. 333-338. , Greece English translation - Paper is written in Greek; Bagiati, A., Florou, C., Kosmopoulou, I., Houstis, E., Third graders experience on using an autodidactic programming software: A phenomenological perspective (2011) Proceedings of 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Vancouver, B.

Mastering these technical writing skills is important, but difficult for first year engineering students. Leaving secondary school, freshmen are not familiar with common technical writing style or best practices. They tend to write their reports by using a journal-type style. Often they do not proof read their manuscripts and forget about feedback on previous reports. Therefore the Engineering Faculty implemented an intensive technical writing program within the first year design course. This paper describes a study that was performed to evaluate this program. In the first year engineering program, which is common for all engineering disciplines, a technical writing program is implemented within the project-based design course 'Problem Solving and Engineering Design' [2]. By embedding the program within a design course, the writing assignments are meaningful for the students and the contents of the reports matter as well as the writing style [3]. A mixture of teaching and assessment methods was developed to gradually improve students' technical writing skills. Subsequent assignments force the students to reflect upon the basic writing principles and to learn from their previous mistakes. The program consists of consecutive cycles of instruction with clear guidelines about writing style, learning by doing and reflection on received feedback. Furthermore, an interactive lecture using clicking devices is implemented, together with a peer review assignment. Literature shows that peer review can be very effective to improve student writing. The staff involved in the evaluation and feedback process, uses a checklist that summarises the desired writing abilities. This ensures they use the same evaluation norms and it makes the grading easier. Table 1 gives an overview of the assignments, indicating the number of students that work together and details about the instructions and evaluation process. To study the efficacy of the implemented writing program, survey data was gathered. At the end of the first year (from 2003 until 2011), all students enrolled in the design course (about 400 each year), filled out an extensive questionnaire consisting of Likert-type closed statements and open-ended questions. The writing program was then evaluated by item analysis of the statements, examination of the open-ended questions and interviews with the staff involved. Overall, the didactic staff involved, as well as the students, is enthusiastic about the approach. Because of the large number of students enrolled in the course (about 400 each academic year), the staff really appreciates the use of the checklist with desired writing abilities. The students most appreciated the peer review process. Furthermore they agree that the clicking devices, made them think actively about their writing skills during the lecture. In future, the study will be completed by adding detailed information about the evolution of the students' grades. Furthermore the students themselves will be encouraged to keep track of the evolution of their technical writing skills by summarising received feedback in their portfolio.","First year design course; Interactive; Peer review; Technical writing skills","Curricula; Design; Education; Engineering education; Grading; Problem solving; Surveys; Teaching; Technical writing; Engineering disciplines; First year design; First-year engineering designs; First-year engineering programs; Interactive; Peer review; Teaching and assessments; Technical writing skills; Students","Heylen, C., Smet, M., Buelens, H., Van Der Sloten, J., Problem solving and engineering design, introducing bachelor students to engineering practice at K.

Apart from the specific contents of peer feedback comments, the quantity and the diversity of peer feedback compared with teacher feedback is one of the main advantages of the inclusion of peer feedback in assessment. This article describes the second edition of a 15 ECTS project-oriented course for Informatics Engineering Master's students at the University of Minho, in which peer assessment of team performance is part of the assessment method. A shift from teacher- to student-centred learning implies a larger involvement of students in their assessment. Peer assessment and peer feedback are elements of the assessment process that transfer responsibilities from the teacher to the students. They are not just assessment activities, but part of the learning process itself [2]. Students develop skills like making informed judgments, self-evaluation, critical thinking, and coping with frustration by analysing learning outcomes of their peers and formulating feedback. Students are more involved in their assessment process when they have a larger responsibility [3, 4]. Peer assessment of processes creates the opportunity to provide students with extensive feedback that cannot be given by teachers. Student who give feedback to a number of peers and, therefore, also receive feedback from a number of peers are faced with a wide range of feedback statements that represent more than one interpretation, as would be the case of teacher feedback. Student feedback is more open to discussion that teacher feedback [5]. In this study, peer feedback as given in a project work context is analysed and compared with peer feedback of the previous year, in which the demands for students were less extensive. This 15-ECTS course aims to emulate real-life situations faced by software engineers. Its main aim is to enable students to acquire skills related to: (1) development of a software product, system or service in a team, and (2) analysis of the potential business value of the product. By working in large teams the students learn many professional skills, such as communication, leadership, responsibility, HR management, project management, and marketing. The project is carried out within a strict time limit. 61 students, divided in 5 teams participated in the study. All teams had to define and describe five peer assessment criteria, decide on their relative weights and define five benchmarks. Feedback comments were analysed using the categories Strengths, Weaknesses, Remark on specific task, Remedial action, General encouragement, Justification of grade, Transferable skills, Not enough information and No comments. At four different moments, a given student had to assess, through the web-based tool, each of their peers on all the five criteria, by assigning a grade between 0 and 100 and writing a justification. This led to 4,369 justifications. Looking at the distribution of the comments over the categories, the Strengths category has the highest frequencies (>65%). When comparing the four assessment moments through a one-way analysis of variance, no significant differences were found between the relative distributions over the categories. A one-way ANOVA between the five teams revealed significant differences. The most important conclusion of this study is that the peer feedback system enabled an amount of feedback that is impossible to provide by teachers. Students wrote more than 4,500 comments, receiving at least 60. The distribution over the categories is still rather unbalanced and using the identification of strengths as the major category of feedback comments leaves out opportunities for improvement. Only at the last assessment moment, when frustration and irritation with peers who work less, have taken over, students feel at ease to make critical comments. Making more balanced comments that also take into account aspects of improvement will contribute to reflection on and improvement of their own work [1].","Peer assessment; Peer feedback","Education; Engineering education; Human resource management; Learning systems; Project management; Social networking (online); Teaching; Assessment activities; Assessment process; Peer assessment; Peer feedback; Professional skills; Project-oriented course; Student centred learning; Transferable skills; Students","Li, L., Liu, X., Steckelberg, A.L., Assessor or assessee: How student learning improves by giving and receiving peer feedback (2010) British Journal of Educational Technology, 41 (3), pp. 525-536; Dochy, F., Segers, M., Sluijsmans, D., The use of self-, peer and coassessment in higher education: A review (1999) Studies in Higher Education, 24 (3), pp. 331-350; Topping, K., Peer assessment between students in colleges and universities (1998) Review of Educational Research, 68 (3), pp. 249-276; Fallows, S., Chandramohan, B., Multiple approaches to assessment: Reflections on use of tutor, peer and self-assessment (2001) Teaching in Higher Education, 6 (2), pp. 229-246; Gielen, S., Dochy, F., Onghena, P., Struyven, K., Smeets, S., Goals of peer assessment and their associated quality concepts (2011) Studies in Higher Education, 36 (6), pp. 719-735; Liu, N.-G., Carless, D., Peer feedback: The learning element of peer assessment (2006) Teaching in Higher Education, 11 (3), pp. 279-290; Topping, K.J., Peer assessment (2009) Theory Into Practice, 48 (1), pp. 20-27; Ford, R.M., Goodrich, J.G., Weissbach, R.S., A multidisciplinary business and engineering course in product development and entrepreneurship (2004) 34th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE 2004); Van Hattum-Janssen, N., Fernandes, J.M., Peer-assessment in projects: An analysis of qualitative feedback (2011) Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Project Approaches in Engineering Education (PAEE 2011), pp. 51-57. , N. van Hattum-Janssen, R.

To begin with, we provide an outline and critical analysis of the communication aspects in the current programme of study. In the next section, we document our plans and efforts towards developing a learning trajectory to incrementally build up written and oral communication skills. In this respect, we also describe the creation and intended implementation of an extensive assessment rubric and didactic training sessions. Finally, we will conclude and discuss and recommend future work. The necessity for this project stems from the current lack of systematic approach to the development of written and oral communication competences among engineering students in our Bachelor's and Master's engineering programmes. In our view, the achievement of effective writing and presentation abilities requires extensive practice and efforts throughout the engineering curriculum. Based on this premise, we have chosen to further embed and promote written and oral communication in selected projectbased courses of the existing curriculum, so that skill acquisition can occur as part of the discipline-specific coursework. Taking the Problem Solving and Engineering Design module in the Bachelor's programme as a starting point, we want to expand our emphasis on written and oral communication to cover the full curriculum. Therefore, we promote written and oral communication instruction in the mandatory courses concluded in the module as well as in equivalent courses in the Master's programmes. These courses are arranged into a learning trajectory that will enable all students to acquire a more complete set of communication competencies throughout the full engineering curriculum at KU Leuven. The Master's thesis in the final year of the Master's programmes should be seen as the final project in which engineering students are enrolled. The learning outcomes of the Master's thesis are closely related to the attainment targets of the study programme and will be used as input for the learning trajectory. These outcomes and related assessment criteria will be structured and integrated into each of the courses selected to form part of the learning trajectory. Furthermore, students are ought to attain a certain level of performance in written and oral communication in each stage of the trajectory. In short, we expect that students progress from an apprentice level in the beginning of the Bachelor's programme over a practitioner level to a master level at the end of the Master's programme. Our future work includes translating these performance levels in an extensive assessment rubric aligned with the stated learning outcomes. In support of the trajectory, we will also create guidelines and learning material as well as training for academic staff. Together, these tools will inform students how to perform in order to achieve a given grade and provide teaching staff with detailed guidance on how to assess student' achievement. It is the ultimate goal of our education project that communication skills constitute a continuous line throughout the five-year engineering programme at our university. In bringing together all existing but disparate efforts throughout the curriculum, we wish to improve the academic and professional success of our students and to respond to the requirements of the present engineering workplace.","Assessment instrument; Communication skills; Didactic training; Learning trajectory","Curricula; Education; Personnel training; Problem solving; Students; Teaching; Trajectories; Assessment instruments; Communication skills; Engineering curriculum; Engineering programmes; Engineering workplace; Learning trajectories; Oral communication skills; Project-based course; Engineering education","Lappalainen, P., Communication as part of the engineering skills set (2009) European Journal of Engineering Education, 34 (2), pp. 123-129; Lilliesköld, J., Östlund, S., Designing, implementing and maintaining a first year project course in electrical engineering (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (2), pp. 231-242; Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, (2006) Engineering Change: A Study of the Impact of EC2000, , http://www.abet.org/engineering-change; Platt, J.R., (2010) Survival Skills for Scientific Writing: Webinar Explains How Members Can Improve Their Scientific Writing Skills for Peer-reviewed Journals, , http://theinstitute.ieee.org/career-and-education/career-guidance/survival-skills-forscientific-writing512; Jennings, A., Ferguson, J.D., Focusing on communication skills in engineering education (1995) Studies in Higher Education, 20 (3), pp. 305-314; Sageev, P., Romanowski, C.J., A message from recent engineering graduates in the workplace: Results of a survey on technical communication skills (2001) Journal of Engineering Education, 90 (4), pp. 685-692; Ravesteijn, W., De Graaff, E., Kroesen, O., Engineering in the future: The social necessity of communicative engineers (2006) European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (1), pp. 63-71; Londers, E., Berbers, Y., Buyse, M.P., Froyen, L., De Proft, M., ACQA: An instrument for accreditation and quality assurance in engineering curricula?

At the same time it is necessary to improve both the attractiveness of engineering to prospective students and retention in engineering programmes. Research suggests that to address these problems the full student learning experience needs to better affirm students' identity formation. Student feedback is identified as a key source of intelligence to inform curriculum and course development. An argument is made for clarifying the purpose of any student feedback system, as there is an inherent tension between utilising it for accountability or for enhancement. An example shows how enhancement is best supported by a rich qualitative investigation of how the learning experience is perceived by the learner. Further, a tension between student satisfaction and quality learning is identified, suggesting that to usefully inform improvement, feedback must always be interpreted using theory on teaching and learning. Finally, a few examples are provided to show various ways to collect, interpret and use student feedback. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

For course evaluation, students are generally required to provide feedback about an instructor/facilitator's performance (student- teacher feedback), in this case on a rating scale questionnaire. Often such feedback only reflects student satisfaction instead of enhancing learning and teaching. A more meaningful form of feedback that may be used to inform effective learning is one-to-one feedback (either student-teacher or teacher-student feedback). Engaging in hands-on practical work and project activities with students can also generate useful feedback for instructors/teachers. Currently, general education courses at many Thai universities aim to equip students with skills related to the provision of effective feedback such as: asking the right questions and non-judgmental criticism. It is strongly believed that, in the near future, social media will play an important role in 360-degree feedback which may, for example, provide further support to the students to foster their learning.

This chapter outlines research undertaken to analyse the role of soft skills in engineering education. The study was conducted at the Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre, a leading technical institute in India. In this study, a personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA) instrument was used on a sample of 101 students to measure their soft skills. Overall, it was found that students realised the need to enhance their soft skills since it would give them a 'competitive edge' when seeking employment. The PRCA prompted students to reflect on the need to develop team skills and interpersonal skills. No significant difference was found between the attitudes of male and female students. The detailed findings of the study are presented in this chapter. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

Engineering students, like those from other disciplines, are encouraged to complete feedback questionnaires at all levels from individual course evaluation forms to institutional-level surveys and the National Student Survey. Engineering suffers more than most from poor recruitment, difficulties in motivating students and higher than average drop-out rates. This chapter explores the ways in which this may be reflected in student experience surveys. A review of student feedback surveys at national and institutional level indicates three key issues. First, engineering students seem to be noticeably poor at responding to student experience surveys. Second, engineering students have been slightly less satisfied with items relating to assessment and feedback than some other disciplines. Third, it is arguable that engineering students are less satisfied with aspects of their experience because of conditions that are local to individual institutions rather than anything specifically relating to the engineering student experience. This indicates that surveys carried out at institutional level provide a degree of detail and depth that is difficult to reflect at the broader, national level. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

Since 2000 these forces have been expressed in government policies of programme accreditation and funding. This national context is exemplified through the experience at the University of Santiago of Chile. The expectations of the workplace with regard to the strengths and weaknesses of engineering education have been usually expressed through the desired learning outcomes of the programmes, many of which address attitudes rather than scientific or technological aspects. From this perspective, the actual developments in student feedback, considered as a significant resource for quality improvement, are discussed. Finally, some conclusions about structural factors that, in both the industrial sector and the universities, strengthen the achievement of the necessary consistency between the country's needs and university responses are drawn. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

Unlike students from other programs in FKE that start their PBLab in the fourth year (final year), students of Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical-Medical Electronics) program start their PBLab one semester earlier, i.e. in their third year of study and have to sit for another PBLab course in their final year. Since the implementation of PBLab for third year students, 2 set of rubrics were used. Set A was based on forth year PBLab that address different program outcomes (PO) than third year one. Meanwhile, to better reflect POs for the third year PBLab, set B was deviced to replace set A and was used since 2009. Since the transformation from rubric set A to set B, no study has been conducted on its effect on student performance. Therefore, this study focuses on student performance with different assessment rubrics and methods. Based from our findings, it is clear that rubrics used in set B together with the use of quantitative assessment reflect students' performance better and hence the decision to replace older version of rubrics (set A) was justified. © 2012 IEEE.","assessment; laboratory; performance; problem-based; quantitative; rubrics","Curricula; Engineering education; FORTH (programming language); Laboratories; Planning; Sustainable development; assessment; performance; Problem-based; quantitative; rubrics; Students","(1994) National Science Education Standards Assessments in Science Education, , National Academy Press; Joy, R., Nickless, L.J., Revolutionising assessment in a clinical skills environment-a global approach: The recorded assessment (2008) Nurse Education in Practice, 8 (5), pp. 352-358. , September; Macdonald, R., Savin-Baden, M., A briefing on assessment in problem based learning (2004) LTSN Generic Centre Assessment Series No. 13, Learning and Teaching Support Network, , Heslington York, UK; Dym, C.L., Agogino, A.M., Eris, O., Frey, D.D., Leifer, L.J., Engineering design thinking, teaching and learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education; Miflin, B.M., Campbell, C.B., Price, D.A., A lesson from the introduction of a problem based, graduate entry course: The effects of different views of self direction (1999) Medical Education, 33, pp. 801-807; Masek, A., Yamin, S., Problem based learning model: A collection from the literature (2010) Asian Social Science, 6 (8). , August; Yadav, A., Subedi, D., Lundeberg, M.A., Bunting, C.F., Problem based learning: Influence on student's learning in an Electrical Engineering Course (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (2), pp. 253-280. , April; Md.

Nevertheless, the objective of this paper is to propose the customised-design of learning pills that can be applied in T&L activities, as an alternative method to promote persuasion strategies in m-Learning environment. The learning pills are designed contextually using the Foggs' persuasion message categories, thus this paper involves students from the Requirement Engineering (RE) coursework. As initial results, it is found that the persuasive learning pills were successfully designed for m-Learning platform. At the same time the persuasive learning pills are expected to encourage learners to become more motivated in their studies by inducing enthusiastic learning habits and behaviour. © 2012 IEEE.","m-Learning; Persuasive computing; Teaching and Learning (T&L)","Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Pelletizing; Planning; Sustainable development; Teaching; Interactive applications; Learning environments; M-Learning; Mobile Learning; Persuasion strategy; Persuasive computing; Requirement engineering; Teaching and learning; Learning systems","Telegraph, B., The smartphone generation (2011) Teenagers Addicted to Their Mobile Phone, , http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/, [cited May 31, 2012]; Available from:; Union, I.T., (2008) ICT Statistics Newslog-mobile Internet Users to Top 1. 7 Billion by 2013, , http://www.itu.int/ITUD/ict/newslog/ Mobile+Internet+Users+To+Top+17+Billion+By+2013.aspx, [cited May 30th, 2012]; Available from:; Frohberg, D., Goth, C., Schwabe, G., Mobile learning projects-a critical analysis of the state of the art (2009) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 25 (4), pp. 307-331; Holzinger, A., Nischelwitzer, A., Meisenberger, M., Mobile phones as a challenge for m-learning: Examples for mobile interactive learning objects (milos) (2005) Third IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops(PerCom 2005).; Martinez, D., Garcia, F., Sãnchez, I.A., Analyzing mobile learning issues in a higher education context (2006) International Conference Mobile Learning 2006 IADIS; Motiwalla, L.F., Mobile learning: A framework and evaluation (2007) Computers & Education, 49 (3), pp. 581-596; Chatterjee, S., Price, A., Healthy living with persuasive technologies: Framework, issues, and challenges (2009) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 16 (2), p. 171; Xu, J., A case study of the design and evaluation of a persuasive healthy lifestyle assistance technology: Challenges and design guidelines Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction.

Their inability to realize the importance of mathematics and its applications in technical subjects are some of the reasons for their poor performance. The conventional teaching approach usually separates the teaching of mathematics from technical subject. This approach does not promote students' awareness in both subjects. Hence, it contributes to their poor understanding in these subjects. This paper discusses a reform in the teaching approach of image processing from conventional to a newly teaching method which involved an integration of mathematics and image processing contents. The mathematics topics which are relevant to image processing applications were proposed to be taught simultaneously. In this sense, mathematics and image processing lecturers will be collaborating in teaching the application of matrices and matrix transformation in image processing subject. This could lead to a new teaching approach which is more stimulating and interesting learning environment for the students and more productive and dynamic for lecturers. © 2012 IEEE.","image processing; mathematics; matrices; matrix transformation; teaching","Engineering education; Image processing; Mathematical techniques; Matrix algebra; Planning; Sustainable development; Teaching; Image processing applications; ITS applications; Learning environments; Matrix transformation; Teaching and learning; Teaching approaches; Teaching methods; Technical subjects; Students","Caridade, C.M., Applying image processing techniques to motivate students in linear algebra classes Proceedings of SEFI Annual Conferences of European Society for Engineering Education, , Lisbon; Gail Rose, J.S.A.C., Connecting artistically-inclined k-12 students to physics and math through image processing examples (2009) 13th IEEE Digital Signal Processing Workshop & 5th Signal Processing Education Workshop (dsp/spe2009); Weng, T.-S., 3D mathematics-Seeing is believing (2011) International Journal of E-Education, E-Business, E-Management and E-Learning, 1 (1). , April; Heikki Huttunen, M.V.J.T.M.L., Motivating the mathematics studies by real-life examples of signal processing and communications engineering (2011) IEEE Digital Signal Processing Workshop and IEEE Signal Processing Education Workshop (DSP/SPE); Milne, A.S.A.-H.R.H., The role of mathematics and physics in engineering degrees (2008) 100 METSMaC-I, CiteSeerX, pp. 100-106; George Bebis, D.E.M.S., Review of computer vision education (2003) IEEE Transaction on Education, 46 (1), pp. 2-21. , FEBRUARY 2003; Orsak, S.D.R.A., The infinity project: Expanding signal processing education to the high school classroom (2001) IEEE Workshop on the Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics; Macandrew, A., Teaching image processing using minimal mathematics (2003) Proceedings of the 5th Australasian Conference on Computing Education (ACE), , Adelaide; Hamilton, W.A.S.D.J., Pedagogical issues for effective teaching of biosignal processing and analysis (2010) 32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, , Beunos Aires; Cardella, M., Which mathematics should we teach engineering students?

However, the program outcomes can only be achieved if they are properly linked to the courses outcomes. In this paper, a top-down approach that links the program outcomes to the courses outcomes is presented. The approach is based on analysis of set theory between the program and the courses outcomes sets. It also examines the level of details that can be used when linking the program and the courses outcomes. The main features of this approach are: Each program outcome is analyzed to determine the components that make that outcome. Each course or course outcome can only contribute to one program outcome thus, eliminating the need for the weights matrix. In addition, this approach ensures that all the program outcomes can be measured by appropriately linking them or embedding them in the appropriate courses or courses outcomes. This method has an added advantage whereby the outcomes for a given course can be evaluated in terms of their contribution to the program outcome. © 2012 IEEE.","Linking courses to program outcomes; Outcome-based Education; Program outcomes Assessment","Planning; Sustainable development; Level of detail; Outcome-based education; Program outcomes; Program outcomes assessments; Top-down approach; Engineering education","Gastli, A., Al-Habsi, A., Al-Abri, D., Innovative program and course outcomes' assessment tools (2009) Proceeding of the Frontiers in Educations, , Texas, USA; Enno, K., ABet program criteria: Review and assessment for a civil engineering program (2001) Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 445-455. , July; Rennels, K., Outcomes assessment in an MET program (2002) Proceeding of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition; Deng, Z.T., Ruben, R., Qian, X., Developing assessment tools for outcome based engineering courses (2002) Proceeding of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition; (2006) Advantages and Disadvantages of Various Assessment Methods, , http://www.morningside.edu/academics/research/assessment/documents/ advantagesdisadvantages.Pdf, Morningside College Assessment Handbook; Biney, P., Kommalapati, R., Gyamerah, M., Annamalai, A., Biomon, P., Peng, X., Ketkar, M., Iyengar, R., Development of performance criteria for assessing program outcomes in engineering, engineering technology & computer science programs Proceeding of the 2008 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , June 22-25-Pittsburgh, PA; Boards of Engineers, , http://www.bem.org.my/v3/index.html, Malaysia; Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology, , http://www.abet.org/20124thInternationalCongress",,,,,"English","ICEED - Int.

It focuses on the measurable outcome of the achievement of the students in terms of the skills and abilities to prepare themselves before embarking upon their career path. The final year project (FYP) is one of the major subjects in an engineering program. It can be considered as a problem based learning (PBL) subject where students need to apply and integrate their theoretical knowledge and skills to solve a given task in two academic semesters. Due to the significant number of credit units allocated for this subject, it has become an essential subject to focus on during the accreditation process. As the accreditation process proceeds and progresses, it should consider the improvised actions that would be necessary to improve the quality of the program, which is the continuous quality improvement (CQI) cycle. This paper focuses on the implementation of the CQI process in an electrical & electronic engineering final year project implementation. It describes the comments and feedbacks from the stakeholders and the implemented CQI actions to address the uprising issues during the accreditation process. © 2012 IEEE.","component; CQI (continous quality improvement); engineering; final year project","Accreditation; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Engineering education; Planning; Sustainable development; Accreditation process; component; Continuous quality improvement; Final year projects; Outcome-based education; Problem based learning; Quality improvement; Undergraduate program; Students","Rashid, M.H., The process of outcome-based education: Implementation (2012) Assessment and Evaluation, , UiTM Press, Kuala Lumpur; Spady, W., Outcome-based education: Critical issues and answers (1994) VA:American Association of School Administrators, , Arlington; Killen, R., Outcomes-based education: Principles and possibilities (2000) Faculty of Education, , University of Newcastle; (2012), http://www.washingtonaccord.org/.AccessedAugust, Washington Accord, International Engineering Agreements; OBE accreditation committee (2011) Self-Assessment Report.

Therefore, an accurate and unified database for perception and generation of visual speech could be organized. Toward this aim, mathematical tools and processes are suggested for concluding the speech related visual units. The lip geometry is parameterized with feature points. The main interpolation tool has been chosen as the Barycentric Lagrange interpolation (BLI). It can include the mouth geometry's structure dynamically during articulation in mathematical form.

Accordingly, a major field of competency for engineering education encompasses the various skills of community engagement. Community engagement is an art combining knowledge of various humanities knowledge with technical skills. This blend of competencies allows engineers be able to address issues of relevance to concerned communities in order to transform a project into a community serving one with indispensable benefits to the community. For instance, a project, which besides its main technical objectives is able to secures better roads, transportation, education and health, is a well regarded project to almost every community. While to an investor, those community beneficial aspects are merely added cost it is becoming increasingly essential to pursue community acceptance to the project. This study presents types of competencies social, analytical and managerial, which engineers need to acquire in order to be able to present a project and secure backing of the community. Competencies required include communication and presentation skills analytical approaches, interdisciplinary skills, and intimate ability to lead.

This paper describes a neural network based model (NN model) for academic performance prediction of Electrical Engineering Degree students at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia. The study was conducted on student intakes from Matriculation entry level. The performance was measured based on their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) upon graduation. The students' results for fundamentals subjects at first semester are used as predictor variables (initial values) for predicting the expected (projected) final CGPA upon graduation using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The outcomes of the study indicated that there appears to be a direct correlation between students' results for core subjects at semester one with the final overall academic performance irrespective of their gender. It can be ascertained that the analysis on strong students' abilities in engineering fundamentals contributed strongly in influencing the overall academic performance in Engineering. Based on the outcomes of this study, we believe that strategic interventions can be done during their study period to improve their final performance, which can be extracted from this prediction model. © 2012 IEEE.","academic performance Neural Network; engineering fundamentals; Prediction","Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Forecasting; Neural networks; Planning; Sustainable development; Academic performance; Cumulative grade point averages; Educational institutions; Engineering fundamentals; Network-based modeling; Neural network model; Predictor variables; Strategic interventions; Students","Arsad, P.M., Buniyamin, N., Manan, J.A., Profiling the performance of electrical engineering bachelor degree students based on different entry levels (2011) International Journal of Education and Information Technologies, 5 (2); Arsad, P.M., Buniyamin, N., Manan, J.A., Proposed academic students' performance prediction model: A malaysian case study (2011) ICEED 3rd International Congress on Engineering Education; Arsad, P.M., Buniyamin, N., Rasheid, N.A., Evaluation of academic performance of electrical engineering bachelor degree students from various entry levels: A case study (2010) 9th WSEAS International Conference on Education and Educational Technology (EDU '10); Zaharim, Perception and expectation towards engineering graduates by employer: A malaysia study case (2009) WSEAS Transaction on Advances in Engineering Education, 6 (9). , September; Ali, N., The factors influencing students performance at universiti teknologi mara kedah, malaysia (2009) Management Science and Engineering, 3 (4); Kabra, R.R., Bichkar, R.S., Performance prediction of engineering students using decision trees (2011) International Journal of Computer Application, 36 (11); Ket Al, K., Development of genetic algorithms and multilayer perceptron neural network (mpnn) model to study the students performance in thermodynamics (2009) International Engineering Education Conference, , Medinah; Oladokun, V.O., Predicting students' academic performance using artificial neural network: A case study of an engineering course (2008) The Pacific Journal of Science and Technology, 9 (1). , May-June (Spring); Sembiring, S., Prediction of student academic performance by an application of data mining technique (2011) International Conference on Management and Artificial Intelligence; Naik, B., Ragothaman, S., Using neural network to predict mba student success (2004) College Student Journal, 38 (1); Ibrahim, Z., Daliela, R., Predicting students' performance: Comparing neural network, decision tree and linear regression (2007) 21st Annual SAS Malaysia Forum; Arsad, P.M., Female electrical engineering degree students performance based on different entry levels: A malaysian case study (2011) WSEAS; Musirin, I., (2007) Short Course on ANN and Evolutionary Programming; Media, A., (2006) Applying NN with MATLAB Hands-On Training; Essentials of Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences 4th Edition Frederick J Gravetter; ISIS: UiTM Information System Management",,,,,"English","ICEED - Int.

The advancements in web technologies motivated the personalized learning, pressurizing for a more personalized course for individuals. The driving components of a personalized course are the course structure and the learning content. This paper highlights the research carried out in designing a personalized course. Prior knowledge and learning styles are the two major parameters considered here for personalizing a course. Also the paper considers majorly on Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) conformance of the personalized courses, encouraging re-usability and interoperability of the courses across multiple learning systems. The main theme of the paper is to propose a system that guides an instructor to understand and provide personalized course path including learning content, activities etc. The proposed system reduces the time and burden of the instructor by considering the group of learners rather than individuals, achieved through clustering the groups based on their similar learning styles, which represents a traditional teaching model applied by the instructors. © 2012 IEEE.","Cluster; Learning Style; Personalization; Prior Knowledge Test; SCORM","Curricula; Distance education; Interoperability; Learning systems; Planning; Sustainable development; Cluster; Learning Style; Personalizations; Prior knowledge; SCORM; Engineering education","Felder, R.M., Silverman, K.L., Learning and teaching styles in engineering education (1988) Engineering Education, 78 (7), pp. 674-681; Jain, S., Jain, D.K., Bhojak, H., Bhilwar, A., Mamatha, J., Personalization of e-Learning services using Web Mining and Semantic Web (2011) The 3rd International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing [ICMLC], , Singapore; Uday Kumar, M., Swathi, M., Jain, S., Jain, D.K., Improvisation of learner's ability using adaptive online assessment methodology (2012) International Journal of Computer Systems and Industrial Management Applications (IJCISIM); Jyothi, N., Bhan, K., Mothukuri, U., Jain, S., Jain, D., A Recommender system assisting instructor in building learning path for Personalized Learning System (2012) IEEE International Conference on Technology for Education, , T4E; SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model), , http://www.adlnet.gov/capabilities/scorm/scorm-2004-3rd; Limongrlli, C., Sciarrone, F., Temperini, M., Vaste, G., LECOMPS5: A WEB-BASED LEARNING SYSTEM for COURSE PERSONALIZATION and ADAPTION; Sangineto, E., An Adaptive E-Learning Platform for Personalized Course Generation, pp. 262-263; Carver, C.A., Enhancing student learning through hypermedia courseware and incorporation of studentlearning styles (1999) IEEE Transactions on Education, 42 (1), pp. 33-38; Capuano, N., Automatic student personalization in preferred learning categories (2005) 3rd International Conference on University Access in Human-Computer Interaction, , Las Vegas, Nevada; Savic, G., Konjovic, Z., Learning style based personalization of scorm e-learning courses (2009) 7th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics, , SISY '09",,,9781467348683,,"English","ICEED - Int.

Many initiatives have been made especially in reviewing the PBLab assessment methods to ensure that the students are properly assessed and their ability to acquire both technical and generic skills can be successfully measured. This paper presents the analysis made on the students' grades in relation to the key performance indicator (KPI) achievements of the PBLab Course Outcomes (CO). The analysis focuses on the level of CO achieved through the PBLab which maps to the Program Outcome (PO). The list of PO and the types of assessment used for the PBLab are examined. The students' marks as given by the facilitators based on various assessment criteria are processed to calculate the KPI value that defines the level of CO achievement in the PBLab course. The findings of the research have shown that there is inconsistency between the marks obtained by the students and the KPI values calculated for each of the PBLab CO. Further investigation and analysis is needed in resolving this inconsistency to ensure that the students' grades can up to certain extend reflect their capability in achieving the PBLab outcomes which maps to the program outcomes. © 2012 IEEE.","assessments; laboratory; learning outcomes; problem-based learning","Benchmarking; Curricula; Engineering education; Laboratories; Planning; Sustainable development; Assessment criteria; assessments; Investigation and analysis; Key performance indicators; Learning outcome; Problem based learning; Program outcomes; Students' grades; Students","New strait times (2003) Why Local Grad Losing Out, , Malaysia: Sepang; Ministry of higher education (mohe) (2006) The Future of Engineering Education in Malaysia Department of Institutions of Higher Education Management, (1); (2011) ABET, , http://www.abet.org/, Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs.

A Manual containing guidelines on how to assemble the PCB, and experiments to be performed using the assembled PCB, was also prepared. The PCB and Manual were mass-produced and distributed to four hundred and ten (410) respondents classified as student-respondents (400) and faculty-respondents (10), from four (4) different universities. The student-respondents were specializing in Computer Engineering (CoE), Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE), Computer Technology (CT), Electronics Technology (ET), and Electronics and Communication Engineering Technology (ECT). The faculty-respondents were engineering instructors, lecturers and professors teaching digital electronics. Respondents were asked to use and evaluate the PCB in terms of functionality, reliability and ease of use. Likewise, they were asked to evaluate the Manual in terms of thoroughness, clarity of instructions, and ease of use. For the PCB, findings of the study showed a mean distribution of 1.78-2.00 for functionality, 1.69-2.00 for reliability, and 1.57-2.00 for ease of use. The Manual has a mean distribution of 1.80-2.10 for thoroughness, 1.70-2.00 for clarity of instructions, and 1.91-2.09 for ease of use. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, a = 0.05) showed that there is no significant difference in the evaluation of the PCB in terms of respondents' classification (p=0.815), and specialization (p=0.726), but there is significant difference in terms of gender (p=0.016) and university to which the respondents belong (p=0.000). © 2012 IEEE.",,"Engineering education; Organic pollutants; Planning; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Communication engineering; Communications engineering; Computer engineering; Design and evaluations; Electronics technology; Engineering innovations; Engineering instructors; Printed circuit boards (PCB); Printed circuit boards","Krikpatrick, J.M., (1985) Electronic Drafting and Printed Circuit Board Design, , San Francisco, CA: Delmar Publishing, Inc; Mano, M.M., (1998) Digital Electronics International Edition, , 2nd Edition, Prentice Hall, USA; Electronics enthusiasts Electronic Enthusiasts Projects and Circuits Volume 1 and 2, , Philippines: Electronic Hobbyist Publishin","Basister, S.D.; University of NizwaOman; email: solane@unizwa.edu.om",,,,"English","ICEED - Int.

An informal survey was carried out among third-year mechanical engineering students on a four-year bachelor course at the University of Malta in order to fi nd out about their preferred learning style. Thirty-one students were surveyed, which represented 12.5% of students following the BEng (Hons) course in mechanical engineering. The survey indicated that 59.7% of engineering students prefer learning through 'feeling or concrete experience', 9.7% prefer learning through 'watching or refl ective observation', 12.9% prefer learning through 'thinking or abstract conceptualisation' and 17.7% prefer learning through 'doing or active experimentation'. The laboratory activities were designed in such a way as to entice students to use hands-on learning to complement the theory explained during lectures. The four-stage Kolb learning cycle was used as a model on which to design the set of laboratory activities. An example of a topic in mechanics of materials is used in this study to assess the students' response in terms of Kolb's proposal for effective learning. The topic selected (combined bending and torsion) is part of the mechanical engineering degree curriculum. © Manchester University Press.","Combined bending and torsion; Kolb's learning cycle; Laboratory work; Mechanics of materials","Active experimentation; Combined bending; Engineering undergraduates; Kolb's learning cycle; Laboratory work; Mechanical engineering students; Mechanics of materials; Teaching and learning; Active experimentation; Combined bending; Engineering undergraduates; Kolb's learning cycle; Laboratory work; Mechanical engineering students; Mechanics of materials; Teaching and learning; Curricula; Laboratories; Mechanical engineering; Mechanics; Surveys; Torsional stress; Curricula; Education; Laboratories; Mechanics; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Torsional stress; Students; Engineering education","Carlson, L.E., Sullivan, J.F., Hands-on engineering: Learning by doing in the integrated teaching and learning program (1999) Int.

The participants were selected based on their lack of familiarity with the Australian university system: they were either fi rstyear undergraduate Australian students matriculating directly from high school or newly arrived international students. Attitudes to plagiarism were determined through interviews and surveys. Their abilities to recognise and rate the level of plagiarism in a series of writing samples were also examined. The results revealed that there was little difference between the international and fi rst-year Australian students. Skill defi ciencies and language issues, representing potentially signifi cant disadvantage with respect to academic writing, were evident, however, when international students were asked to correct the identifi ed plagiarised material. In the international student group there was poor alignment of students' understanding of plagiarism and their perception of its impact with that stated in university academic conduct policy. It also appears that after the admission requirements for an Australian tertiary institution are met, the lack of exposure to and familiarity with specifi c academic cultural expectations is as signifi cant as the ethnicity and linguistic background of the student. © Manchester University Press.","Domestic; Engineering education; International; Plagiarism","Comparative studies; Domestic; International; International students; Linguistic backgrounds; Mechanical engineering students; Plagiarism; Tertiary institutions; Cultural influences; domestic; international; International students; Linguistic backgrounds; Mechanical engineering students; Plagiarism; Tertiary institutions; Engineering education; Intellectual property; Mechanical engineering; Computational linguistics; Education; Engineering education; Intellectual property; Students; Students","Stappenbelt, B., Rowles, C., May, E., Cultural infl uence on attitudes to plagiarism' Teaching and Learning for Global Graduates (2009) Proceedings of the 18th Annual Teaching Learning Forum, , 29-30 January, Perth, Australia; Deckert, G.D., Perspectives on plagiarism from ESL students in Hong Kong (1993) J.

This paper describes the use of the blended learning model in a course entitled 'Optical Communications', given in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Brasília, Brazil. Throughout the article, the authors will analyse technological solutions found for the different segments which make up the implemented teaching/learning environment and the main diffi culties they came across in their bid to integrate new interactive technologies into the traditional educational process. Finally, the concrete experience of applying this methodology in the course will be discussed. A survey conducted at the end of the course showed that students were satisfi ed with the pedagogical approach.

Tertiary networks and telecommunications engineering students are required to learn all aspects about the Internet and Internet services. The open-source, research and teaching platform, Network Simulator (NS) was integrated with the open-source Joint Model (JM) H.264/AVC encoder-decoder to educate students about computer networks. On this integrated educational platform, videos can be encoded and encapsulated into network packets with modifications to JM encoder source code. These packets are sent across a NS simulated network with a simulated NS multicast server. NS multicast clients subscribe to NS multicast servers. Other network traffic can compete with the multicast packets and cause congestion. Traffic shaping, fairness and other networking techniques can be simulated with real video data. Packet loss in such an environment is inevitable. Multicast clients receive the video stream with some losses. Clients' data can be decoded using a modified JM decoder. Lost data can be concealed using error concealment techniques or reconstructed with losses. The integration of NS and JM is ideal to teach the next generation's network and telecommunications engineers, all aspects of network traffic including streaming media, streaming protocols, subscription, traffic congestion, traffic shaping and fairness. This paper describes the necessary modifications to JM and NS and gives examples of educational exercises and discussions. © 2012 IEEE.","Educational Platform; NS and JM; Open-Source","Decoding; Education computing; Engineering education; Image coding; Media streaming; Multicasting; Network architecture; Network coding; Open source software; Students; Telecommunication traffic; Video on demand; Video streaming; Virtual reality; Web services; Educational platforms; Error concealment technique; International community; Network simulators; Open sources; Open-source network; STreaming protocols; Telecommunications engineerings; Packet networks","James, A., Montelle, C., Williams, P., The University of Southern California: Information Sciences Institute, , http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/, http://nsnam.is i.edu/nsnam/in dex.php/User-I nformation; Iyengar, J.R., Amer, P.D., Stewart, R., Concurrent multipath transfer using SCTP multihoming over independent end-to-end paths (2006) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 14 (5), pp. 951-964. , DOI 10.1109/TNET.2006.882843; Cao, X., Shen, C.-C., Subscription-aware publish/subscribe tree construction in mobile ad hoc networks (2007) International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, pp. 1-9; Qiao, Z., A new method for VoIP quality of service control use combined adaptive sender rate and priority marking (2004) IEEE International Conference on Communications, pp. 1473-1477; Hui, T.C.-K., Tham, C.-K., Adaptive provisioning of differentiated services networks based on reinforcement learning (2003) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, pp. 492-501; De Souza-Daw, T., Chilamkurti, N.K., Soh, B., Enhanced split-layer protocol with H.264 based error concealment technique (2006) Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Networks and Communication Systems 2006, 2006, pp. 85-90. , Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Networks and Communication Systems 2006; De-Souza Daw, T., An integration of H.264 based error concealment technique and the SPLIT layer protocol (2006) IEEE International Conference on Networking (ICN), pp. 109-114; Brugge, J., Experience report on implementing and simulating a routing protocol in NS-2 and NS-3 (2010) Second International Conference on Advances in System Simulation (SIMUL), pp. 88-93; Lee, M.-H., Yoe, H., Comparative analysis and design of wired and wireless integrated networks for wireless sensor networks (2007) Proceedings - SERA 2007: Fifth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management, and Applications, pp. 518-522. , DOI 10.1109/SERA.2007.65, 4296980, Proceedings - SERA 2007: Fifth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management, and Applications; Kobayashi, M., Reliable application layer multicast over combined wired and wireless networks (2009) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, pp. 1466-1477; Sun, Z., Green, R.J., Improving optical wireless links for internet applications (2003) IEE Colloquium on DSP Enabled Radio, pp. 1-9; Sühring, K., H.264/AVC Software Coordination, , ed: Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications Heinrich Hertz Institute; Tao, Y., More scanning patterns for entropy coding for H.264 (2007) International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (IEEE), pp. 490-493; Huang, C.-C., Kuo, S.-Y., Optimization of hybridized error concealment for H.264 (2008) IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting, pp. 499-516; Schmidt, J.C., Rose, K., Macroblock-based retransmission for errorresilient video streaming. 15th (2008) IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, pp. 2308-2311; Zhu, C., Error resilient video coding using redundant pictures (2009) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, pp. 3-14; Auweara, G.V.D., Traffic and quality characterization of single-layer video streams encoded with the H.264/MPEG-4 advanced video coding standard and scalable video coding extension (2008) Advances in Multimedia (IEEE), pp. 698-718; Swaroop, K.V.S., Rao, K.R., Performance analysis and comparison of JM 15.1 and Intel IPP H.264 encoder and decoder (2010) 42nd IEEE Southeastern Symposium on System Theory (SSST), pp. 371-375; Swaroop, K.V.S., Rao, K.R., The ns-3 Network Simulator, , http://www.nsnam.org/; Wang, Y., http://www.ee.columbia.edu/-ywang/Links/#Software, Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University; YUV Video Sequences, , http://trace.eas.asu.edu/yuv/; De Souza-Daw, T., (2005) The SPLIT Protocol Integrated with An Error Concealment Algorithm (Honours Thesis): Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, , La Trobe University; Souza-Daw, T.D., Multimedia curriculum for an introductory course for information technologist (in press) (2011) International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing & Multimedia (ACM-MoMM)","De Souza-Daw, T.; Centre of Technology, , Ho Chi Minh City, Australia",21659559,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Learning to cope with emerging technologies for educational purposes is, for most educators, a complex process. Consequently, educators engage in critical reflective processes, and consider new views as they learn new knowledge and skills so as how to best apply information and communication technologies to teaching and learning. For educators this process can be intimidating and frustrating. The use of new technologies in education requires educators to reconceptualise traditional educational concepts which means that educators need compelling reasons to dramatically change their teaching and learning practice.This paper highlights the significance of Mezirow's transformative learning theory for teachers' technology professional development and provides insight in teachers' learning processes as they learn emerging technologies for educational purposes. The data discussed in this paper have been drawn from a study at FontysUniversity of Applied Sciences, The Netherlands. The data were collected and analyzed according to a qualitative approach.","Emerging technologies; Higher education; Technology professional development; Transformative learning","Professional aspects; Teaching; Emerging technologies; Higher education; Information and Communication Technologies; Life long learning; Professional development; Qualitative approach; Teaching and learning; Transformative learning; Engineering education","Sachs, J., Teacher professional identity: competing discourses, competing outcomes (2001) Journal of Education Policy, 16, pp. 149-161. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02680930116819; Robinson, B., Latchem, C., Teacher Education: Challenges and Change (2003) Teacher Education through Open and Distance Learning, pp. 1-27. , Robinson, B &Latchem, C, Eds.

There is a growing expectation for educators to be well informed and familiar with the many suitable technologies and systems that are available to be used for delivering courses online, and to complement classroom (face-to-face) education. Detailed evidence of the perceptions and applications of the use of e-technologies is needed to inform not only teaching practice, but also policy development. These e-technologies need to be matched to pedagogical styles in order for online teaching and learning to be successful. Based on 33 semi-structured interviews, this paper presents a study of staff experiences of e-technologies, using Chickering and Gamson's 'Seven Principles of Good Practice' to provide educators with information about the most appropriate e-technology to support their pedagogical aims.","E-learning; E-technologies; Good practice; Higher education; Pedagogical styles; Teaching","E-learning; Online systems; Teaching; E-technology; Good practices; Higher education; Online teaching and learning; Pedagogical styles; Semi structured interviews; Teaching and learning; Technologies and systems; Engineering education","Romiszowski, A.J., How's the E-learning Baby?

The literature review concluded that common national P-12 engineering education standards are beneficial, particularly when amplified by the common core standards movement. Purpose (Hypothesis): Compilation and analysis of engineering present in states' academic standards was performed to determine if a consensus on the big ideas of engineering already exists and to organize and present those big ideas so that they can be infused into state or national standards. Design/Method: Extensive examination and broad coding of mathematics, science, technology and vocational/career standards in all 50 states identified instances of engineering content in existing standards. Explicit coding categorized engineering-relevant standards by subject area. Manual and electronic content analysis identified key engineering skills and knowledge in existing standards. Inter-rater reliability verified consistency among five individuals through descriptive statistical measures. Results: Engineering skills and knowledge were found in 41 states' standards. Most items rated as engineering through strict coding were found in either science or technology and vocational standards. Engineering was found in only one state's math standard. Some states explicitly mentioned engineering standards without any specifics. A consensus of big ideas found in standards is provided in the discussion. Conclusions: While engineering standards do exist, uniform or systematically introduced engineering standards are less prevalent. Now is the time to move forward in the formation of national standards based on the state standards identified in this study. © 2012 ASEE.","Engineering standards; National standard; Policy research; State standards","Bridges; Codes (symbols); Education; Engineering education; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Elementary education; Engineering standards; Inter-rater reliabilities; National standard; P-12 engineering educations; Policy researches; State standards; Statistical measures; Standards","Beatty, A., (1997) Taking Stock: What Have we Learned About Making Education Standards Internationally competitive?, , Board on International Comparative Studies in Education Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences.

Purpose (Hypothesis): The purpose of this study is to understand how and under what conditions research groups foster successful learning and professional development for graduate engineering students, and how these findings can be used to inform management of engineering research groups to optimize student learning, productivity, and intent to complete the degree. Design/Method: This study utilizes a sequential exploratory mixed methods design, with nine months of ethnographically guided observations and interviews used to develop an online survey instrument. Data reported in this paper include results from the ethnographic analysis and survey responses from over 800 students at four institutions. Results: Key findings from the ethnographic analysis indicate that group size directly influences the mechanisms of student learning. Survey results confirm the prevalence of engineering graduate research groups, as well as several elements common across research groups from different universities and academic departments, including: interactions and communication, access to resources, and role of the advisor. Conclusions: An understanding of the mechanisms for learning in research groups can be used by engineering administrators, faculty members, and graduate students to create an environment that fosters successful learning and professional development. We also recommend practices for ensuring positive experiences for all graduate students, which may ultimately reduce attrition from engineering graduate programs. © 2012 ASEE.","Graduate education; Mixed methods; Research group","Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Research and development management; Surveys; Engineering graduate programs; Engineering graduates; Graduate education; Graduate engineering students; Mixed method; Positive experiences; Professional development; Research groups; Students","Adams, J.D., Black, G.C., Clemmons, J.R., Stephan, P.E., Scientific teams and institutional collaborations: Evidence from U.S. universities, 1981-1999 (2005) Research Policy, 34 (3), pp. 259-285. , DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2005.01.014, PII S0048733305000132; Alberts, B., On Becoming a Scientist (2009) Science, 326 (5955), p. 916. , doi: 10.1126/science.1184202; Altbach, P.G., Berdahl, R.O., Gumport, P.J., (1999) American Higher Education in the Twentyfirst Century: Social, Political, and Economic Challenges, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Anderson, M.S., Lewis, K.S., The graduate student experience and subsciption to the norms of Science (1994) Research in Higher Education, 35 (3), pp. 273-299; Anderson, M.S., Louis, K.S., Jason, E., Disciplinary and departmental effects on observations of faculty and graduate student misconduct (1994) The Journal of Higher Education, 65 (3), pp. 331-350; Belcher, D., The apprenticeship approach to advanced academic literacy: Graduate students and their mentors (1994) English for Specific Purposes, 13 (1), pp. 23-34. , doi: Doi: 10.1016/0889-4906 94 90022-1; Boden, D., Borrego, M., Newswander, L., Student socialization in interdisciplinary doctoral education (2011) Higher Education, pp. 1-15. , doi: 10.1007/s10734-011-9415-1; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing Grounded Theory, a Practical Guide to Qualitative Analysis, , Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publications; Crede, E., Borrego, M., The effect of international diversity on graduate engineering education: A literature review (2010) The 2010 American Society of Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, , Louisville, KY; Crede, E., Borrego, M., International diversity in graduate engineering education: Development of a multi institutional survey (2010) The 2010 Frontiers in Education Conference, , Arlington, VA; Crede, E., Borrego, M., From ethnography to items: A mixed methods approach to developing a survey to examine graduate engineering student retention Journal of Mixed Methods Research, , in press; Creswell, J.W., (2007) Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing Among Five Approaches, , 2nd ed..

In this paper, the author investigated the learning outcomes that the type of graduate attributes can deliver in the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Sichuan reconstruction project. This project encompassed an experiential learning experience enabling students to serve the post-quake Sichuan community by applying their knowledge and skills. The author will explore how this community service type of experiential learning in the engineering discipline allowed students to experience deep learning and develop their graduate attributes. It is shown that most students dealt with authentic and unfamiliar challenges through group cooperation, and were able to reflect from the experience and act accordingly.

The paper describes the development and offering of a multi-disciplinary graduate course covering earthquake loss assessment and mitigation 'from source to society'. The course is built upon the comprehensive research, education, and outreach activities of the National Science Foundation-funded Mid-America Earthquake (MAE) Centre through the paradigm of consequence-based risk management (CRM). This is the first course of its kind in the field of earthquake engineering to expose students to the earthquake problem from source to society. The course was successfully offered at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and will be offered at other universities. The CRM programme is a successful model for similar educational experiences. It opens new avenues in education of loss assessment and mitigation to meet the demands on the engineering profession by integration of engineering, social-economic science and information technology in a single multi-disciplinary course.

One such advancement is subsumed under the title ""smart structures,"" which use smart materials possessing unique qualities to collectively generate an adaptive structural system. Although the smart structure concept is widely used in the mechanical and aerospace engineering industries, the civil engineering community has been slow to adopt it because of system complexity and high cost. In addition, many universities still do not include smart structures in their curricula, which has hindered their broad implementation into modern structures. This paper presents a specialized course on smart structures designed to further the use of smart technologies in engineering education and ultimately the real-world. Included in the background is a look at institutions that already provide classes on the subject and a description of how one school (i.e., Texas A&M University) organized the class, including lab demonstrations, homework, projects, and lecture outline, as well as student evaluations of the class. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Adaptive structures; Education; Intelligent structures; Smart structures","Adaptive structure; Engineering community; Engineering industries; High costs; Modern structures; Smart technology; Structural systems; Student evaluation; System complexity; Aerospace engineering; Civil engineering; Curricula; Education; Intelligent structures; Engineering education","Benz, R., Niethammer, M., Hurlebaus, S., Jacobs, L.J., Localization of notches with Lamb waves (2003) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 114 (2), pp. 677-685. , DOI 10.1121/1.1593058; Bies, D.A., Hansen, C.H., (1996) Engineering Noise Control: Theory and Practice, , E & FN Spon, London; Branham, S.L., Wilson, M.S., Hurlebaus, S., Beadle, B.M., Gaul, L., Nondestructive testing of overhead transmission lines (2006) Conf. on Damage in Composite Materials, , Collaborative Research Centers (CRC) SFB 381, Stuttgart; Cheng, F.Y., Jiang, H., Lou, K., (2008) Smart Structures: Innovative Systems for Seismic Response Control, , CRC, Boca Raton, FL; Chopra, I., Review of state of art of smart structures and integrated systems (2002) AIAA Journal, 40 (11), pp. 2145-2187; Clark, R.L., Saunders, W.R., Gibbs, G.P., (1998) Adaptive Structures: Dynamics and Control, , Wiley, New York; Cress, D., The F word in the classroom: Fail and learn (2002) Proc., 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition, , Montŕal, Quebec, Canada; Elliot, S.J., Nelson, P.A., (1995) Active Control of Sound, , Academic, London; Fuller, C.R., Elliot, S.J., Nelson, P.A., (1996) Active Control of Vibration, , Academic, London; Gaul, L., Hurlebaus, S., Albrecht, H., Wirnitzer, J., Enhanced damping of lightweight structures by semi-active joints (2008) Acta Mech., 195 (14), pp. 249-261. , 0001-5970, 10.1007/s00707-007-0547-4; Gautschi, G., (2002) Piezoelectric Sensorics: Force, Strain, Pressure, Acceleration and Acoustic Emission Sensors, Materials and Amplifiers, , Springer Verlag, Berlin; Giurgiutiu, V., Review of smart-materials actuation solutions for aeroelastic and vibration control (2000) Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 11 (7), pp. 525-544. , DOI 10.1106/HYTV-NC7R-BCMM-W3CH; Giurgiutiu, V., Bayoumi, A.-M.E., Nall, G., Mechatronics and smart structures: Emerging engineering disciplines for the third millennium (2002) Mechatronics, 12 (2), pp. 169-181. , DOI 10.1016/S0957-4158(01)00057-5, PII S0957415801000575; Holnicki-Szulc, J., Rodellar, J., Smart structures: Requirements and potential applications in mechanical and civil engineering (1999) NATO Science Series, , Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, The Netherlands; Hurlebaus, S., (2005) Smart Structures-fundamentals and Applications: Lecture Notes, p. 256. , Zachry Dept. of Civil Engineering, Texas A&M Univ., College Station, TX; Hurlebaus, S., Gaul, L., Smart layer for damage diagnostics (2004) J.

By using sensors and computerized data acquisition, the RAISE project sought to enhance students' academic achievement; excite them about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM); and inspire them to pursue STEM careers. Fellows assisted the teachers in presenting the lab experiments and helped students to understand the lab assignments. Despite difficulties in establishing appropriate baseline grades and comparison groups, analysis of available test scores of students involved in the RAISE versus non-RAISE classes indicates that (1):a slightly larger percentage of RAISE project students took standardized exams; (2):a larger percentage of RAISE project students passed the exams; and (3):the average grade attained by RAISE project students is slightly higher. Moreover, responses of high school students and their teachers to project evaluation questionnaires suggest that the RAISE project had some positive effects. The high school teachers were generally supportive of the project, found the fellows helpful in a variety of ways, and rated the sensor-based lab exercises as effective. The majority of teachers recommend participation in the project to other teachers. Fellows also recommend the project to other university students. They generally found the project a rewarding experience that helped them in developing their own science skills and most would be interested in continuing the experience. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Engineering education; High schools; Instrumentation; K-12; Outreach; Sensors; Student achievement; Teacher training","High school; Instrumentation; K-12; Outreach; Student achievement; Teacher training; Engineering education; Experiments; Laboratories; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Project management; Sensors; Surveys; Students","(2005) Losing the Competitive Advantage? the Challenge for Science and Technology in the United States, , American Electronics Association (AeA)..

In Spain, professional competences are awarded along with the completion of a university degree. This means that new graduates are certified in areas in which they have received little or no training, such as occupational risk prevention. However, the academic reforms established by the Bologna Process, which strives to homogenize university degrees throughout Europe, compels European universities to design new syllabi. The main goal of this paper is to define a framework for including occupational risk-prevention education in the new engineering syllabi. This exploratory research applied the Delphi methodology to a panel of 59 experts, using questionnaires assessed with a four-point Likert scale through two rounds. A website supported the information flow. According to the experts who participated in this study, education and training in occupational risk-prevention is essential for improving the safety culture within a company or workplace. The experts concurred that this subject should be a separate mandatory course in all engineering degree programs. The participants recommended that an optional course should be considered only if a mandatory course is not approved. It was also deemed desirable to integrate occupational risk prevention as a cross-field subject in other technological courses, even if the curriculum already includes some related courses. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Delphi; Education; Engineering; Occupational; Prevention; Risk","Bologna process; Delphi; Delphi methodology; DELPHI study; Education and training; Engineering degrees; European universities; Exploratory research; Four-point; Information flows; Occupational; Prevention; Professional competence; Safety culture; University degree; Curricula; Education; Engineering; Engineering education; Occupational therapy; Risks; Surveys; Technical presentations; Occupational risks","Alhemood, A., Development of safety engineering curricula in the Gulf Cooperative countries to meet local manufacturing needs (2004) Hum.

In this experimental study, nonconstruction engineers with a supervisory role in the delivery of capital projects were instructed in three fundamental construction management subjects, i.e. front-end planning, contracts and project execution, and project completion and team dynamics. These subjects were independently instructed in a traditional classroom-style setting. To capture the sustained impact of the educational intervention, a self-assessment survey tool was designed and distributed to the instructed engineers 4 months after the intervention. The educational intervention resulted in a significant gain in construction expertise among the engineers. The intervention also induced positive changes in the work practice of the instructed engineers and of their organization, such as the development of solid intercommunication skills across engineering disciplines. Overall, the results of this study indicate a significant opportunity for transferring construction management principles and techniques to the engineers in the U.S. construction workforce. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction management; Continuing education; Engineering education; Professional development; Professional practice; Project management","Capital projects; Construction management; Continuing education; Educational intervention; Engineering disciplines; Experimental studies; Fundamental construction; Positive changes; Professional development; Professional practices; Project completion; Project execution; Self-assessment; Work practices; Education; Engineering education; Management science; Project management; Engineers","(2006) The Vision for Civil Engineering in 2025.

Many alternatives to traditional laboratory instruction have been tested to improve educational benefits and to reduce academic input. This paper describes the benefits of laboratory classes run in an interactive competitive framework to enhance the teaching of structural engineering and construction materials. A creative framework that defines limits and quantifies performance encourages student engagement and allows reasonable control without stifling creativity. Two examples are presented in this paper: a wood bridge competition as part of an introductory structural engineering design course and a concrete technology competition within a structural concrete course. The educational benefits of this broad-based approach are compared with other laboratory methods. Course surveys suggest that students view this method of laboratory education positively when it is well integrated within an engineering degree course. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction materials; Enginering education; Laboratory; Structural engineering","Concrete technology; Educational benefits; Engineering degrees; Engineering design course; Laboratory class; Laboratory education; Laboratory methods; Laboratory models; Structural concretes; Student engagement; Undergraduate engineering; Undergraduate engineering students; Building materials; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Laboratories; Structural design; Students","Abdulwahed, M., Nagy, Z.K., Applying Kolb's experiential learning cycle for laboratory education (2009) J.

PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This research interrogates prevailing assumptions about industrial engineering to explore why undergraduate women are drawn to industrial engineering over other engineering majors. DESIGN/METHODS Our mixed method approach used three sources of data. Quantitative analyses of a large, longitudinal dataset allowed us to draw empirical generalizations about academic performance, attraction to, and persistence within industrial engineering among men and women. We triangulated this with qualitative focus group data among women majoring in IE. Finally, we used content analysis of university IE Web sites to understand context and discourse. RESULTS In our dataset, industrial engineering is the only engineering major that gains women and men from the third semester through six-year graduation and among all race-gender combinations (except Black men). Women in focus groups reveal that they are drawn to IE for a myriad of social factors including: warmth, flexibility, a sense it is more feminine, and career opportunities, among others. Content analysis of Web sites reveals that IE emphasizes collegiality and leadership opportunities as intrinsic to the discipline. CONCLUSIONS Using a social capital framework, we showed that the context of IE, including prevailing norms and possibilities for networking, promotes ideologies of success that lead to greater attraction to and persistence within the major. © 2012 ASEE.","Industrial engineering; Social capital; Women","Engineering education; Industrial engineering; Industrial research; Web crawler; Websites; Academic performance; Career opportunities; Content analysis; Empirical generalizations; Social capitals; Social factor; Undergraduate women; Women; Professional aspects","Berg, B., (2007) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon; Beyer Lodahl, J., Gordon, G., The structure of scientific fields and the functioning of university graduate departments (1972) American Sociological Review, 37 (1), pp. 57-72; Bix, A., From engineeresses to girl engineers to good engineers: A history of women's American engineering education (2004) National Women's Studies Association, 16 (1), pp. 27-49; Blakemore, A.E., Low, S.A., Sex differences in occupational selection: The case of college majors (1984) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 66 (1), pp. 157-163; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement [Sic] of Taste, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Brawner, C.E., Camacho, M.M., Long, R.A., Lord, S.M., Ohland, M.W., Wasburn, M.H., Work in progress: The effect of engineering matriculation status on major selection (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 Frontiers in Educational Conference, San Antonio, TX; Brown, S., Flick, L., Williamson, K., Social capital in engineering education (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 Frontiers in Education Annual Conference, Indianapolis, in; Comte, A., (1896) The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte, 1. , http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015009198121, (H.

PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) A long line of research has suggested that students and faculty often have different perceptions of educational efforts and practices. In this study, we consider this as a potential reason for the continued mixed results of engineering ethics education by examining differing perceptions of faculty and students about ethics education and identifying contributing factors to those differences. DESIGN/METHOD We conducted focus groups and interviews with engineering undergraduate students, faculty, and administrators on 18 campuses. Transcripts were analyzed using both deductive and inductive analyses and constant comparison. We identified both themes of discrepancies between faculty/administrator and student perceptions and factors in the educational environment that contributed to those discrepancies. RESULTS Discrepancies between the perceptions of faculty/administrators were seen in two forms. Faculty/ administrators believed that ethics education encompasses teaching about laws, ethical codes, and other black-and-white solutions while also addressing more nuanced ethical dilemmas; students reported only experiencing the laws-and-rules approach. Students also did not see faculty as the positive ethical role models that faculty believed they are. Factors that contribute to both types of discrepancies are identified and reported. CONCLUSIONS This approach can be effective in examining difficulties in teaching engineering ethics. Educators should take steps to understand the different ways faculty/administrators and students perceive ethics education, and how factors in the educational environment contribute to differences in those perceptions. © 2012 ASEE.","Culture; Environment; Ethics","Cell culture; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Philosophical aspects; Teaching; Contributing factor; Educational environment; Engineering educators; Engineering undergraduates; Environment; Ethics; Professional engineerings; Student perceptions; Students","(2010) Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs: Effective for Evaluations during the 2010-2011 Accreditation Cycle, , http://www.abet.org, Retrieved from; Astin, A.W., The methodology of research on college impact (Part I) (1970) Sociology of Education, 43 (3), pp. 223-254; Astin, A.W., The methodology of research on college impact (Part II) (1970) Sociology of Education, 43 (4), pp. 437-450; Astin, A.W., (1993) Assessment for Excellence: The Philosophy and Practice of Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, , Phoenix, AZ: The Oryx Press; Bielby, R., Harding, T.S., Finelli, C.J., Carpenter, D.D., Sutkus, J.A., Holsapple, M.A., Burt, B.A., Ra, E., Impact of different curricular approaches to ethics education on ethical reasoning ability (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, Vancouver, Canada; Burt, B.A., Carpenter, D.D., Finelli, C.J., Harding, T.S., Sutkus, J.A., Holsapple, M.A., Bielby, R., Ra, E., Outcomes of engaging engineering undergraduates in cocurricular experiences (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, Vancouver, Canada; (2009) The Carnegie Classifications of Institutions of Higher Education, , http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/, Retrieved from; Colby, A., Sullivan, W.M., Ethics teaching in undergraduate engineering education (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3), pp. 327-338; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) The Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory (2nd Ed.), , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Eagen, M.K., Jaeger, A.J., Closing the gate: Part-time faculty instruction in gatekeeper courses and first-year persistence (2008) New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 2008 (115), pp. 39-54; (2009) Psychological Sense of Community and Retention: Rethinking the First-year Experience of Students in STEM (Doctoral Dissertation), , http://etd.fcla.edu/CF/CFE0002841/DagleyFalls-Melissa-A-200912-EdD.pdf, Retrieved from; Finelli, C.J., Harding, T.S., Carpenter, D.D., Mayhew, M.J., Academic integrity among engineering undergraduates: Seven years of research by the E3 Team (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, Honolulu, HI; Finelli, C.J., Holsapple, M.A., Ra, E., Bielby, R.M., Burt, B.A., Carpenter Sutkus, J.A., Journal of Engineering Education; Fritschner, L.M., Inside the undergraduate college classroom: Faculty and students differ on the meaning of student participation (2000) Journal of Higher Education, 71 (3), pp. 342-362; Gil, D.H., Heins, D.M., Jones, P.B., Perceptions of medical school faculty members and students on clinical clerkship feedback (1984) Journal of Medical Education, 59 (11), pp. 856-864; Godfrey, E., Parker, L., Mapping the cultural landscape in engineering education (2010) Journal of Engineering Education, 99 (1), pp. 5-22; Goldstein, G.S., Benassi, V.A., Students' and instructors' beliefs about excellent lecturers and discussion leaders (2006) Research in Higher Education, 47 (6), pp. 685-707. , DOI 10.1007/s11162-006-9011-x; Harding, T.S., Carpenter, D.D., Finelli, C.J., Passow, H.J., Does academic dishonesty relate to unethical behavior in professional practice?

Instructors need to interpret student work and give feedback with high potential to guide students to close the gap between actual and reference level performance. To understand instructor feedback and its impact, a framework for analyzing instructor feedback is necessary. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) The purposes of this study were to develop a framework to analyze instructor feedback on team responses to open-ended mathematical modeling problems and to demonstrate the use of the framework in investigating formative assessment systems. DESIGN/METHOD To develop the framework, formative feedback from graduate teaching assistants on first-year engineering student team responses to the Just-In Time Manufacturing Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) was analyzed. The framework in conjunction with a four dimensional MEA Rubric was then used to identify patterns in feedback. RESULTS Feedback has both form and substance. Four forms of feedback were identified: comments not intended to prompt change; and questions, open suggestions, and direct suggestions intended to prompt change. The substance was tied to the criteria used to evaluate MEA responses. Results of applying the framework yielded two claims: (1) the rubric criteria influence the form and intent of feedback, and (2) the perceived quality of student work also impacts the form and intent of feedback. CONCLUSION The framework that emerged from this work is a useful tool for investigating instructor feedback in this context. Further, the framework is believed to be extendable to other learning contexts. © 2012 ASEE.","Formative assessment; Graduate teaching assistants; Model-eliciting activity","Engineering education; Network function virtualization; First-year engineering; Formative assessment; Formative feedbacks; Graduate teaching assistants; Just-in-time manufacturing; Mathematical modeling problem; Model eliciting activities; Open-ended problems; Students","(2010) Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, , Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; Black, P., Wiliam, D., Inside the black box raising standards through classroom assessment (1998) Phi Delta Kappan, 80 (2), pp. 139-148; Black, P., Wiliam, D., Assessment and classroom learning (1998) Assessment in Education, 5 (1), pp. 7-74; Bloom, R.B., Bourdon, L., Types and frequencies of teachers' written instructional feedback (1980) Journal of Educational Research, 74 (1), pp. 13-15; Bowman, K.J., Siegmund, T., Designing modeling activities for upper-level engineering classes (2008) Models and Modeling in Engineering Education: Designing Experiences for All Students, pp. 93-110. , J.

It remains unclear, however, whether qualitative differences in risk of attrition response patterns exist among students. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) The following research questions are the basis for this study: (1) What can be learned about the risk of attrition from engineering by grouping students using a novel method and multiple measures? (2) How are individual characteristics, student experiences, and perceptions related to qualitative differences among students in their risk of attrition? DESIGN/METHOD Latent class analysis identifies qualitative differences among engineering students on measures of risk of attrition. A variety of covariates predict membership in each class using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS Three latent classes are identified with varying degrees of commitment to degree completion and interest in their engineering major. Individuals who are less confident, experience negative interactions with peers and instructors, and hold negative perceptions of engineering are less likely to be committed to engineering and more likely to be interested in other majors. Student experiences mediate the effects of key individual characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Certain types of student experiences are pivotal for a student's commitment to the major and commitment to degree completion. The risk of attrition is sensitive to a combination of student characteristics, experiences, and perceptions. The mediated relationships between risk of attrition and individual characteristics re-iterate the importance of including student experience variables to control for the context of a college. © 2012 ASEE.","Persistence; Risk of attrition; Student experience","Education; Engineering education; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Individual characteristics; Multinomial logistic regression; Perceptions of engineering; Persistence; Qualitative differences; Risk of attritions; Student experiences; Undergraduate engineering; Students","Adelman, C., (1998) Women and Men of the Engineering Path: A Model for Analyses of Undergraduate Careers, , Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education and The National Institute for Science Education; Amelink, C.T., Creamer, E.G., Gender differences in elements of the undergraduate experience that influence satisfaction with the engineering major and the intent to pursue engineering as a career (2010) Journal of Engineering Education, 99 (1), pp. 81-92; (2008) Data Mining Tool, 2008 Undergraduate Engineering Enrollment Data, , American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), Accessed September 25, 2009; Anderson, E.L., Kim, D., (2006) Increasing the Success of Minority Students in Science and Technology, , Washington DC: American Council on Education; Astin, A., Astin, H., (1992) Undergraduate Science Education: The Impact of Different College Environments on the Educational Pipeline in the Sciences, , Los Angeles, CA: Higher Education Research Institute, UCLA; Besterfield-Sacre, M., Atman, C.J., Shuman, L.J., Characteristics of freshman engineering students: Models for determining student attrition in engineering (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (2), pp. 139-150; Besterfield-Sacre, M., Atman, C.J., Shuman, L.J., Engineering student attitudes assessment (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 87 (2), pp. 133-142; Bonous-Hammarth, M., Pathways to success: Affirming opportunities for science, mathematics, and engineering majors (2000) Journal of Negro Education, 69 (1-2), pp. 92-111; Brainard, S.G., Carlin, L., A six-year longitudinal study of undergraduate women in engineering and science (1998) Journal of Engineering Education, 87 (4), pp. 369-375; Brainard, S.G., Metz, S.S., Gillmore, G., WEPAN pilot climate survey: Exploring the environment for undergraduate engineering students (1999) Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE/ISTAS Conference on Women and Technology: Historical and Professional Perspectives; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (1998) Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information Theoretic Approach, , New York, NY: Springer; Campbell, P.B., Patterson, E.A., Busch-Vishniac, I., Kibler, T., Integrating applications in the teaching of fundamental concepts (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 Annual Conference and Exposition of the American Society for Engineering Education, Pittsburgh, PA; Clewell, B.C., De Cohen, C.C., Tsui, L., Forcier, L., Gao, E., Young, N., Deterding, N., West, C., (2005) Final Report on the Evaluation of the National Science Foundation Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Program, , Washington, DC: Program for Evaluation and Equity Research (PEER), The Urban Institute; Cole, D., Espinoza, A., Examining the academic success of Latino students in science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors (2008) Journal of College Student Development, 49 (4), pp. 285-300; Collins, L.M., Lanza, S.T., (2010) Latent Class and Latent Transition Analysis: With Applications in the Social, Behavioral, and Health Sciences, , Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons; Crawford, M., MacLeod, M., Gender in the college classroom: An assessment of ""chilly climate"" for women (1990) Sex Roles, 23 (3-4), pp. 101-122; De Cohen, C., Deterding, N., Widening the net: National estimates of gender disparities in engineering (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (3), pp. 211-226; Diekman, A.B., Brown, E., Johnston, A., Clark, E., Seeking congruity between goals and roles: A new look at why women opt out of STEM careers (2010) Psychological Science, 21, pp. 1051-1057; Elliott, R., Strenta, A.C., Adair, R., Matier, M., Scott, J., The role of ethnicity in choosing and leaving science in highly selective institutions (1996) Research in Higher Education, 37 (6), pp. 681-709; Eris, O., Chachra, D., Chen, H., Sheppard, S., Ludlow, L., Rosca, C., Bailey, T., Toye, G., Outcomes of a longitudinal administration of the persistence in engineering survey (2010) Journal of Engineering Education, 99 (4), pp. 371-395; Fortenberry, N.L., Sullivan, J.F., Jordan, P.N., Knight, D.W., Engineering education research aids instruction (2007) Science, 317 (5842), pp. 1175-1176; Frehill, L.M., Education and occupational sex segregation: The decision to major in engineering (1997) Sociological Quarterly, 38 (2), pp. 225-249; Goodman, I.F., Cunningham, C., (2002) Final Report of the Women's Experiences in College Engineering (WECE) Project.

American engineers need additional dimensions of knowledge in order to compete and for the United States to retain its role as the world leader in technological innovation. Engineers need to master much beyond the concepts of engineering itself to advance, branch out, and be most effective during their careers. It is also well recognized that it is essential to diversify the engineering profession further in order to sustain it in the United States. Today the choice towards a technical career must be made early in high school or even in junior high school in order to avoid substantial delays.

Thus, the engineering education community remains concerned about students who leave engineering and must work to identify the factors that influence those students' decisions. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) Our purpose was to identify a set of factors describing the experiences of students' in a college of engineering that are strong influences on decisions to leave and study how those factors are related to both predictor variables (e.g., high school preparation) and future behaviors (e.g., new major chosen). DESIGN/METHOD We solicited survey data from students who had recently transferred out of a large engineering college. We conducted exploratory factor analysis to determine the main factors for leaving engineering and then used these factors to answer the research questions. RESULTS Results indicate that both academic (e.g., curriculum difficulty and poor teaching and advising) and a non-academic factor (lack of belonging in engineering) contribute to students' decisions to leave engineering. We did find differences for some factors between majority and non-majority students; however, there were no gender differences. CONCLUSIONS Both academic and non-academic factors contribute to students' decisions to leave engineering; however, our sample indicated the non-academic factors may be a stronger influence. Implications for educators focus on addressing both academic and the belonging factor and include examining pedagogical activities that may be less welcoming to a wide variety of student groups, providing opportunities for meaningful faculty interaction and other activities designed to support students pursuing engineering degrees. © 2012 ASEE.","Academic factors; Diversity; Retention","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Factor analysis; Teaching; Academic factors; Diversity; Engineering colleges; Engineering degrees; Engineering professionals; Exploratory factor analysis; Predictor variables; Retention; Students","Adelman, C., (1998) Women and Men of the Engineering Path: A Model for Analysis of Undergraduate Careers, , http://www.erc-assoc.org/nsf/engrg_paths/EPMONOG.pdf, Washington, DC: U.

Solving design problems requires applying technical knowledge to create original ideas and turn those into practical applications. However, the impact of engineering curricula on the innovation capabilities of undergraduate engineers is not well understood. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This study seeks to provide insights into the research question of whether freshman undergraduate engineering students can be more innovative than seniors. Innovation is measured in terms of the originality of the solutions they propose for an open-ended design problem, as well as the technical feasibility of those solutions for practical application. DESIGN/METHOD Freshman- and senior-level undergraduate engineering students were tasked with developing solutions to a specific design problem (a next-generation alarm clock). Both levels of students used a modified 6-3-5/C-sketch method for generating concepts. A fraction of both the freshman and the senior students also received innovation enhancement. Resulting concepts were analyzed for originality and technical feasibility. RESULTS Freshman students generated concepts that were significantly more original than those of seniors, with no significant difference in quality or technical feasibility of the concepts generated by the two levels of students. CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of the study, the findings suggest that freshman engineering students can be more innovative than their senior-level counterparts. This motivates the need for additional studies to investigate the effect of factors such as skill acquisition and design curricula on the innovation capabilities of students. © 2012 ASEE.","Creativity; Innovation","Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Innovation; Problem solving; Creativity; Engineering curriculum; Experimental investigations; Freshman engineering students; Innovation enhancement; Undergraduate engineering; Undergraduate engineering students; Undergraduate engineers; Students","Adams, R.S., Punnakanta, P., Atman, C.J., Lewis, C., Comparing design team self reports with actual performance: Cross-validating assessment instruments (2002) Proceedings of the ASEE Annual Conference & Exhibition, , Montreal, Quebec; Altshuller, G.S., (1984) Creativity As An Exact Science., , Luxembourg: Gordon & Breach; Amabile, T.M., Conti, R., Coon, H., Lazenby, H., Herron, M., Assessing the work environment for creativity (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (5), pp. 1154-1184; Ambrose, S.A., Amon, C.H., Systematic design of a first-year mechanical engineering course at Carnegie Mellon University (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (2), pp. 173-181; Anderson, J.R., (1983) The Architecture of Cognition, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Angelo, T., Cross, P., (1993) Classroom Assessment Techniques: A Handbook for College Teachers, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; (2004) A Vision of the Future of Mechanical Engineering Education, , ASME Council on Education.

We report on a project between two institutions, one in South Africa and one in Sweden, that investigated whether the emphasis in undergraduate mathematics courses for engineering students would benefit from being more conceptually oriented than the traditional more procedurally oriented way of teaching. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) We focus on how second-year engineering students respond to the conceptual-procedural distinction, comparing performance and confidence between Swedish and South African groups of students in answering conceptual and procedural mathematics problems. We also compare these students' conceptions on the role of conceptual and procedural mathematics problems within and outside their mathematics studies. DESIGN/METHOD An instrument consisting of procedural and conceptual items as well as items on student opinions on the roles of the different types of knowledge in their studies was conducted with groups of second-year engineering students at two universities, one in each country. RESULTS Although differences between the two countries are small, Swedish students see procedural items to be more common in their mathematics studies while the South African students find both conceptual and procedural items common; the latter group see the conceptually oriented items as more common in their studies outside the mathematics courses. CONCLUSIONS Students view mathematics as procedural. Conceptual mathematics is seen as relevant outside mathematics. The use of mathematics in other subjects within engineering education can be experienced differently by students from different institutions, indicating that the same type of education can handle the application of mathematics in different ways in different institutions. © 2012 ASEE.","Conceptual and procedural thinking; Confidence; Mathematics","Education; Engineering education; Knowledge based systems; Mathematical techniques; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Computational skills; Conceptual and procedural thinking; Confidence; Engineering curriculum; Engineering faculty; Mathematics course; Student conceptions; Undergraduate mathematics course; Students","Alpers, B., Studies on the mathematical expertise of mechanical engineers (2010) Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Application, 1 (3), pp. 2-17; Anderson, J.R., (1995) Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications, , (4th edition).
