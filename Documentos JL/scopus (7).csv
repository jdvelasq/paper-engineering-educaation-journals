For that purpose, a statistically significant total number of 96 students in four year groups from freshman to senior level participated in a testing experiment in the Degree Programme of Aviation at the FH JOANNEUM University of Applied Sciences, Graz, Austria. Half of each test group were given a set of 12 physics problems described in German, the other half received the same set of problems described in English. It was the goal to test linguistic reading comprehension necessary for scientific problem solving instead of physics knowledge as such. The results imply that written undergraduate English-medium engineering tests and examinations may not require additional examination time or language-specific aids for students who have reached university-entrance proficiency in English as a foreign language. © 2013 SEFI.","engineering education; English-medium instruction; language impact; problem comprehension; science examinations; testing","English-as-a-Foreign-Language; English-medium instruction; language impact; problem comprehension; Problem-solving performance; Reading comprehension; science examinations; University of applied science; Engineering education; Testing; Students","Airey, J., (2009) Science, language and literacy: Case studies of learning in Swedish university physics, , Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology, 81, Uppsala, Uppsala,: Uppsala Universitet; Airey, J., Linder, C., Language and the experience of learning university physics in Sweden (2006) European Journal of Physics, 27, pp. 553-560; Barton, B., Neville-Barton, P., Language issues in undergraduate mathematics: a report of two studies (2003) New Zealand Journal of Mathematics, 32 (Supplementary Issue, pp. 19-28; Barwell, R., Summing up: teaching and learning mathematics in a multilingual world (2009) Multilingualism in mathematics classrooms: Global perspectives.

In this paper, we use situated cognition theory to examine the effect of product dissection on product redesign activities. Two specific research questions are addressed: 1) Does situated cognition, in the form of product dissection, improve product functionality during redesign exercise?, and 2) Does situated cognition, again in the form of product dissection, affect the creativity during product redesign? In this study, three sections of first-year students in two different locations - The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) and Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T) - performed product redesign using coffee makers. The redesigned products have been analyzed with respect to both depth (detail level) and creativity. Based on our results, we find that situated cognition, in the form of product dissection, improves product functionality during redesign and positively affects creativity.

Presently, however, engineering design concepts and courses can be found through the entirety of most engineering programs. Educators have recognized that engineering design provides a foundational platform that can be used to develop educational strategies for a wide array of engineering science principles. More recently, educators have found that product archaeology provides an effective platform to develop scalable learning materials, strategies, and educational innovations across these design courses. This paper presents and discusses how product archaeology has been incorporated at a large research university in two design-related courses for mechanical engineering students: (1) a sophomore-level course and (2) a senior-level class. More specifically, details are reported regarding how and how easily global, societal, economic, and environmental factors were emphasized in the curricula of these courses. Next, the paper shares the qualitative and quantitative assessment tools and methods used to determine the impact of incorporating a product archaeology paradigm in the courses. Finally, the results are reported which demonstrate a significant increase in the students' perceptions across a number of skill and knowledge areas related to ABET-required Outcome h without negatively impacting other important academic areas. Results demonstrate a significant increase in student perception across a number of skill and knowledge areas critical to the next generation of engineers.","Design theory; Product archaeology","Design theory; Educational innovations; Engineering curriculum; Engineering design concepts; Mechanical engineering curriculum; Mechanical engineering students; Product archaeology; Qualitative and quantitative assessments; Engineering education; History; Mechanical engineering; Product design; Students; Curricula","Burton, J.D., White, D.M., Selecting a Model for Freshman Engineering Design (1999) Journal of Engineering Education, 88 (3), pp. 327-332; Colgate, E., McKenna, A., Ankenman, B., IDEA: Implementing Design Throughout the Curriculum at Northwestern (2004) International Journal of Engineering Education, 20 (3), pp. 405-411; Panchal, J.H., Adesope, O., Malak, R.J., Designing Undergraduate Design Experiences-A Framework based on the Expectancy-Value Theory (2012) International Journal of Engineering Education, 28 (4), pp. 871-879; Wojcik, T.G., Clayton, G.M., Radlinska, A., Comolli, N.K., The Value of Impromptu Design Exercises as an Approach in Design-Centric Engineering Education (2012) International Journal of Engineering Education., 28 (4), pp. 892-903; Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, ABET, Baltimore, MD, p. 1999. , http://www.abet.org/, Engineering Accreditation Commission; (2008) Changing the Conversation: Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineering, , National Academy of Engineering, The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C; Sheppard, S.D., Macatangay, K., Colby, A., Sullivan, W.M., (2009) Educating Engineers: Designing for the Future of the Field, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, CA; Ahlgren, D.J., Fire-fighting Robots and First-year Engineering Design: Trinity College Experience (2001) Proceedings of the ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, , Reno, NV, ASEE, Paper No. S2E-1; Dalrymple, O., Evangelou, D., (2006) The Role of Extracurricular Activities in the Education of Engineers, , International Conference on Engineering Education, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Paper No. T4K-24; Broussard-Wilson, S., (2008) Study Abroad May Feel Pinch of Dollar, , http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24170, Yale Daily News.

Lecture cohorts on these modules are large (250+ students) and examples are delivered through smaller classes (~50 students) and laboratory sessions delivered by supplementary lecturers and/or postdoctoral researchers. This inevitably leads to a lack of continuity and meaningful engagement with regards to students' contact with the lecturer. It also places a significant pressure on 'office hours' and email. It is common in student module feedback that the generic theory on these courses is not linked closely enough to discipline-specific engineering examples. Often this is due to wide range of disciplines studying the course (the EG168 module is taken by all level 1 engineering students and sports science students). This paper details a project aimed at tackling these problems by establishing an online community, using the social networking facility Twitter to connect students to the lecturer, who was able to drip feed examples to students in the form of online video 'mini lectures' posted and discussed via Twitter. It will be argued that this not only allowed an enhanced sense of affinity and belonging within the module cohort, but also improved real time feedback for the lecturer who was able to adjust future lecture content based on the feedback being received via Twitter. This technique was initially trialled on the EG168 Scientific and Engineering Skills module: a very large module (550 students) taken by students in the first term of their degree at Swansea University. It has more recently been adopted by other lecturers within the College on a range of modules. One of the aims within the EG168 module in recent deliveries has been to try and tailor examples to specific engineering disciplines whilst delivering generic content to the whole cohort through large lectures. It will be shown that delivery of online multimedia discipline-specific examples to students via the web (posted and discussed using Twitter) was a significant factor that helped achieve this. © 2013 J.

It is argued here that embedding puzzles in the teaching of other subjects enhances students' learning by developing their problem-solving and independent-learning skills, whilst increasing their motivation to learn mathematics. The authors have defined a puzzle to be a problem that is perplexing and either has a solution requiring considerable ingenuity - perhaps a lateral thinking solution - or possibly results in an unexpected, even a counter-intuitive or apparently paradoxical solution. Engineering specific puzzle variants may help student learning, but specificity can also conflict with desirable simplicity, undermining the pedagogic value of a puzzle. It is not easy to categorize puzzles by level of difficulty, whether of the puzzle as a whole or the underlying mathematics, because this depends on the background and experience of the student. Classroom experiences of using puzzles in engineering teaching are described here, with some puzzles that illuminate these issues. © 2013 J.

But, teachers also observed vast developmental differences between students during workplace learning. To find explanations for these differences, we studied students identity development during workplace learning using a self-guiding and mentoring model. Research questions are: (1) To what extent do bachelor engineering students develop their engineering identity during workplace learning? (2) What are students developmental models? (3) Can different effects of these models on student identity development be found? Participants were 256 third-year bachelor student engineers. The data were collected with two written questionnaires, one before and one after workplace learning. Results showed, first, a significant incline and decline on the two aspects of identity development, clarity and identification. Second, combined achievement on the two aspects showed a sort out into four different development groups. Students entering workplace learning with a low identity score proved to catch up, while those entering with a high score slowed down and developed less, indicating a non-successful preparation for workplace learning. We recommend that students professional identity development should be acknowledged and explicated in the course design so it gets greater and explicate attention during the preparation, during workplace learning, and in the final year. For this purpose a system of career conversations could be used. © 2013 J.

Design educators have, in recent decades, come closer to one another in how they approach design creativity. Still, many distinct differences exist. One of the most striking has to do with the role of prototyping in developing ideas into concrete manifestations. Prototypes unlock cognitive association mechanisms related to visualisation, prior experience, and interpersonal communication in ways that favour iterative learning between peers in the product development community. When, where, and how to use prototyping strategies depends on context, and it demands a high level of situation awareness. The nature of this awareness is, in turn, dependent on cultural variables and curriculum development. Prototyping has been portrayed as an excellent activity to share inner thoughts, yet a deeper connection to its knowledge-building processes has been lacking in previous research. This paper builds on related literature in shaping a common understanding of how prototyping is perceived and applied in two different high-performance academic contexts (Stanford University, Stanford, USA, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden). Our exploration focuses on students' perceived learning experiences and on teachers' experiences within engineering design projects. Prototyping is an active enabler in both cases, establishing iterative loops of new knowledge through social interaction and team-based communication. The deeper level of cognitive attachments to prototyping provides an explicit link between embedded implicit knowledge and its consequences for objective learning. © 2013 J.

Developing research skills at an undergraduate level promotes increased understanding of the basic concepts taught through textbook instruction and provides an awareness of industry relevant issues. This study reports on the introduction of engineering research to undergraduate students in a classroom environment. The course was designed around technical experiments inspired by Michael Faraday's lectures from The Chemical History of a Candle. Fourteen engineering undergraduates enrolled in a Special Topics in Mechanical Engineering course at a large southwestern university participated in five problem-based learning activities that engaged students using interactive, hands-on lessons and activities designed to teach the research process. Based on student assessments, the lessons learned from this experience revealed students understood the practice of research after only three activities yet, the last two activities provide valuable repetition that reinforce the research concepts and allowed for students' critical reflection on research processes. Also, only 20% of the students reported enjoying research enough to pursue graduate school, all of which would commit to a PhD rather than a master's degree. © 2013 J.

The mode of learning design techniques and knowledge is key to the relationship that students gain with this subject. In the School of Mechanical and Systems Engineering at Newcastle University modules in Design and Manufacturing are taught in the first and second year. This paper outlines the transition of the Year 2 Design and Manufacturing module from a paper-based exercise to a design-build-test project-based group exercise over a period of three years between 2007/08 and 2009/10, using an iterative process of student feedback to advise this process of module change. Through this evaluation five key elements were identified, which inform the process of the introduction of practical group working in an engineering setting - these are presented as having utility for engineering education in general. Two conclusions derived from the analysis are also outlined, together with their implications for the engineering higher education sector. © 2013 J.

However, the teacher-centred teaching approach seems still to dominate in engineering education when compared with more active teaching methods that are oriented towards student-centred learning. This article overviews the cognitive levels in engineering education related to the revised Bloom taxonomy, where student-centred methods can contribute more to higher cognitive levels of knowledge. To examine how engineering educators are qualified, a survey was undertaken at two universities in Slovenia and one in Thailand. The analysis of the questionnaires obtained from engineering educators revealed that they seemed to be dissatisfied with the knowledge, skills and motivation of freshmen students applying for entry to engineering programmes. Respondents were aware of the advantages of student-centred approaches, despite their theoretical knowledge being weak, while their capacity for practical implementation of corresponding methods was considered to be much better. © 2013 WIETE.",,"Active teachings; Bloom taxonomies; Cognitive levels; Continuous development; Engineering educators; Engineering programmes; Student-centred learning; Teaching approaches; Curricula; Engineering education; Surveys; Teaching; Students","Ernst, J.V., Nanotechnology education: contemporary content and approaches (2009) The J. of Technol.

This paper describes two innovative, web-based, interactive ITS modules that we developed for and implemented in an engineering dynamics course to help students learn how to apply the Principle of Work and Energy, one of the most important dynamics principles, to solve particle and rigid-body dynamics problems. This paper describes in detail how the two ITS modules were designed, and specifically such aspects as the determination of learning objectives, the design of corresponding dynamics problems that the ITS modules address, the selection of ITS authoring software, and the design of the layout of the interactive computer graphical user interfaces of the ITS modules. Two cohorts of engineering undergraduates during a control semester and a treatment semester participated in the present study. The results of pretests and posttests in the control and treatment semesters show that the two ITS modules increased class-average student learning gains by 36.8% and 43.0%, respectively. In an anonymous questionnaire survey that was administered at the end of the treatment semester, many students used the words ""hints"" and ""step-by-step process"" to describe how the ITS modules enhanced their learning. It is suggested that given their level of flexibility, intelligent tutoring systems should be used as a supplemental tool to enhance learning, rather than a tool to completely replace students' experiences with human instructors and human tutors. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Conceptual understanding;

Small, permanent teams of students met weekly in 90-minute sessions, under the supervision of graduate teaching assistants, undergraduate teaching assistants, or undergraduate volunteers. In these sessions, student teams worked on difficult problems adapted from examinations given in previous semesters. We hypothesized that students who attended the study sessions would earn higher scores on examinations, and they would persist at higher rates in engineering. We also sought to describe the affective benefits that students perceived from attending the study sessions. For three semesters, we recorded students' study session attendance and final exam scores. We surveyed students to obtain their average hours each week spent on ECE 110 and to gauge the perceived benefits of the sessions. We performed linear regression and analysis of covariance tests on the numerical data to analyze student performance. To analyze retention (persistence), we used data about the courses that students took immediately after ECE 110 to form two-way contingency tables. In all three semesters, regular session attendees did not have significantly higher persistence rates, but they scored significantly higher on final exams. Regular attendees reported that they improved their understanding of the material, and made new friends. Some students began to see peers as helpful sources of knowledge. In summary, regular attendance in peer-led team learning sessions benefits students both academically and socially. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Cooperative learning; First-year students; Peer-led team learning; Retention; Workshop","Cooperative learning; First year students; Retention; Team learning; Workshop; Engineering education; Regression analysis; Students","http://www.pltl.org, Accessed June 9, 2013; Gosser, D.K., Cracolice, M.S., Kampmeier, J.A., Roth, V., Strozak, V.S., Varma-Nelson, P., (2001) Peer-led Team Learning: A Guidebook, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J; Johnson, D.W., Johnson, R.T., Smith, K.A., (1991) Cooperative Learning: Increasing College Faculty Instructional Productivity, , ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Report No. 4.

One of the objectives of ITASAT Project, maybe the most relevant one, is to contribute to the human capital improvement by involving university students in the design and development of a small satellite. Thus, this research seeks to understand how capabilities were developed at an individual and a team level, through a process of teaching-learning-teaching, involving a learning-by-doing and learning-by-experiencing support. The methodology used on this research is qualitative, in which the subsystems teams were observed by the researcher during 2010 and 2011. In order to complement and corroborate conclusions based on the observation method, a questionnaire survey was developed, which was applied to a representative sample, aiming to capture students' perceptions regarding learning process and building technological capabilities within the project. Thus, it was observed that students' teams acquired technological knowledge through a teaching-learning method supported by learning-by-doing and learning-by-experiencing processes. The knowledge and skills developed by those teams go beyond the walls of the academy, impacting the Brazilian society and its space industry. Finally, it was concluded that ITASAT Project was a successful learning experience in the field of complex system integration, project management and technical developments accomplished by subsystems teams. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Skills; Team knowledge; Technological knowledge","Design and Development; Questionnaire surveys; Representative sample; Skills; Teaching-learning method; Team knowledge; Technological capability; Technological knowledge; Human resource management; Learning systems; Project management; Research; Satellites; Students; Engineering education","Lall, S., (1994) Technological Capabilities in Salomon, , The Uncertain Quest: Science Technology and Development, Tokyo: UN University Press; Bell, M., Pavitt, K., The development of technological capabilities (1995) Trade, Technology and International Competitiveness, , I.

Yet faculty perceptions of sustainable engineering as 'soft' and outside the boundaries of engineering prevent its widespread inclusion in the engineering undergraduate curriculum. In this paper, we demonstrate how ecofeminist theory could be used to understand the inferior status that sustainable engineering currently occupies in the disciplinary hierarchy. To characterize the ongoing debates and tensions underlying acceptance of sustainability as part of the engineering process as well as of engineering education, we have closely analyzed 42 out of 150 articles published in the area of engineering education using inductive grounded theory, and we relate our themes and sub-themes to ecofeminist theory. The first theme considers sustainability to be a challenging skill set for the future engineer; the second emphasizes the disciplinary aspects of sustainability; and the third theme looks at the normative aspect of sustainability as value-based engineering. We found it helpful to use ecofeminism as a framework for thinking how sustainability's marginalization in engineering education could be related to its 'soft' ness, its chaotic and system-level character, as these aspects align it not with the core of engineering but rather with the marginalized 'feminine.' This framing should help us reconceptualize how we talk about sustainability in engineering education to make it a more integrated and valued concept for future engineering students. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Content analysis; Grounded theory; Literature analysis; Sustainability; Sustainability education","Content analysis; Engineering process; Engineering undergraduates; Faculty perceptions; Grounded theory; Literature analysis; Sustainability education; Sustainable engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Sustainable development","Boyle, C., Considerations on educating engineers in sustainability (2004) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 5 (2), pp. 147-155; Bonnett, M., Education for sustainability as a frame of mind (2002) Environmental Education Research, 8 (1), pp. 265-276; Moore, J., Barriers and pathways to creating sustainability education programs: Policy; Rhetoric and reality (2005) Environmental Education Research, 11 (5), pp. 537-555; Pawley, A.L., Engineering faculty drawing the line: A taxonomy of boundary work in academic engineering (2012) Engineering Studies, 4 (2), pp. 145-169; Lau, A., Sustainable design: A new paradigm for engineering education (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (2), pp. 252-259; Seager, T.P., The sustainability spectrum and the sciences of sustainability (2008) Business Strategy and the Environment, 17 (7), pp. 444-453; Vanasupa, L., Chen, K.C., Splitt, F.G., (2008) Classroom Techniques to Promote Engineering Solutions for a Sustainable Future, , Denton: Int Council Materials Education; Allenby, B., Allen, D., Davidson, C., Sustainable engineering: From myth to mechanism (2007) Environmental Quality Management, 17 (1), pp. 17-26; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of Qualitative Research 3e: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, , Sage, Los Angeles CA; Mack-Canty, C., Third-wave feminism and the need to reweave the nature culture duality (2004) NWSA Journal, 16 (3), pp. 154-179; Crenshaw, K., Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: A black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory, and antiracist politics (1989) University of Chicago Legal Forum, pp. 139-167; Allen, D.T., Shonnard, D.R., (2011) Sustainable Engineering: Concepts, Design and Case Studies, , Prentice Hall, NJ; (1987) Our Common Future, , World Commission on Environment and Development, Oxford University Press, New York; Vanasupa, L., Burton, R., Stolk, J., Zimmerman, J.B., Leifer, L.J., Anastas, P.T., The systemic correlation between mental models and sustainable design: Implications for engineering educators (2010) International Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (2), pp. 438-450; Williams, R., (2002) Retooling: A Historian Confronts Technological Change, , The MIT Press, Boston, MA; Leal-Filho, W., Dealing with misconceptions on the concept of sustainability (2000) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 1 (1), pp. 9-19; Conlon, E., The new engineer: Between employability and social responsibility (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (2), pp. 151-159; Warren, K.J., (2000) Ecofeminist Philosophy: AWestern Perspective on What It Is and Why It Matters, , Rowman and Littlefield, Oxford, UK; Besthorn, F.H., Pierson-Mcmillen, D., The oppression of women and nature: Ecofeminism as a framework for an expanded ecological social work (2002) Families in Society: The Journal of Contemporary Human Services, 83 (3), pp. 221-232; Dobscha, S., Ozanne, J.L., An ecofeminist analysis of environmentally sensitive women using qualitative methodology: The emancipatory potential of an ecological life (2001) Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, 20 (2), pp. 201-214; Zimmerman, M., (1994) Contesting Earth's Future: Radical Ecology and Postmodernity, , University of California Press, Los Angeles, CA; Mies, M., Shiva, V., (1993) Ecofeminism, , Zed Books, London; Brawner, C.E., Camacho, M.M., Lord, S.M., Long, R.A., Ohland, M.A., What makes industrial engineering different?

This means production systems are constantly changing in the direction of the replacement of the low productivity equipment, rearranging the plant layout, the redirection of the transport stream from the supplier to the end customer and adding new models to plan and control production. All these changes aim to improve product quality and to reduce production lead time by eliminating waste, reducing costs and increasing competitive advantage through the process flexibility. For these changes to happen effectively is necessary that the current employees and the future production engineers are inserted and fit in this new reality. Currently, the Lean Manufacturing concepts are applied in an industrial environment to optimize production flow eliminating the waste found in the process. However, there is a challenge to put these concepts effectively in the industrial environment and in the university environment. The traditional learning process based on teacher, classroom, non-integrated theoretical and practical concepts, case studies with static production characteristic (controlled variable) has been shown to be ineffective in the consolidation of these concepts in a dynamic production environment. In university, this same model applied in the production engineering course and fragmented into different disciplines makes production engineers not fully prepared for the challenges of the new industrial environment, requiring an adjustment period. This adaptation will result in low competitiveness of the company in front of global competitors. Thus, this article aims to present a laboratory model for integrated learning of the Lean Manufacturing concepts based in practices able to reproduce the dynamic production environment, thus speeding the process of training employees of the industrial environment and the learning of future production engineers. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Lean manufacturing; Learning factory; Production engineering","Competitive advantage; Industrial environments; Lean manufacturing; Learning factory; Production characteristics; Traditional learning; University environment; University industries; Agile manufacturing systems; Competition; Engineering education; Industrial applications; International trade; Production engineering; Teaching; Personnel training","Elmaraghy, W., Elmaraghy, H., Yomiyama, T., Monostori, L., Complexity in engineering design and manufacturing (2012) CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology, pp. 793-814; Smith, R.P., Barton, R.R., Nowack, C.A., Castro, J.Z., (1996) Concurrent Engineering: A Partnership Approch, , Proceesings of the ASEE Annual Meeting, June; Gwynne, P., Engineering a revolution in engineering education (2012) Research Technology Management, pp. 8-9. , July-August; Nose, M.M., Rebelatto, D.A., O Perfil do Engenheiro segundo as Empresas (2001) XXIX Congresso Brasileiro de Ensino de Engenharia, pp. 25-30; Tryggvason, G., Apelian, D., Re-engineering engineering education for the challenges of the 21st century (2006) JOM, pp. 14-17. , October; Grinter, L.E., Report on the evaluation of engineering education (1956) Engineering Education, 46, pp. 25-63; Lamancusa, J.S., (2006) The Reincarnation of the Engineering Shop, , Proceedings of the IDETC/CIE 2006 ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference.

In turn, engineering students often create slides for classroom presentations to demonstrate what they have learned. Given how often presentation slides are projected and viewed by engineering educators and students, those slides should follow principles of multimedia learning to foster high audience comprehension. Unfortunately, Microsoft PowerPoint, which is the dominant program for creating slides, does not incorporate these principles into its defaults. As a result, most educators and students in engineering create slides that violate these principles. To determine the effect of this violation, we compared learning outcomes in 110 engineering students who viewed a technical presentation in which the slides either integrated or violated six multimedia learning principles. The presentation slides that adhered to the six multimedia principles followed the assertion-evidence approach, while the presentation slides that violated the six multimedia principles followed commonly practiced defaults of PowerPoint. Essay responses from the 110 engineering students revealed superior comprehension and fewer misconceptions for the assertion-evidence group as well as lower perceived cognitive load. In addition, stronger recall occurred in this assertion-evidence group at delayed post-test. These findings support the use of the assertion-evidence structure for presentations in engineering education. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Assertion-evidence; Multimedia learning; PowerPoint; Presentation slides","Assertion-evidence; Classroom presentations; Engineering educators; Learning outcome; Microsoft PowerPoint; Multi-media learning; Powerpoint; Presentation slides; Engineering; Students; Engineering education","Mayer, R.E., (2009) Multimedia Learning, , 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, New York; Piolat, A., Olive, T., Kellogg, R.T., Cognitive effort during note taking (2005) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 19, pp. 291-312; Reedy, G., PowerPoint, interactive whiteboards, and the visual culture of technology in schools (2008) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 17, pp. 143-162; Savoy, A., Proctor, R.W., Salvendy, G., Information retention from PowerPoint and traditional lectures (2008) Computers and Education, 52, pp. 858-867; Susskind, J.E., PowerPoint's power in the classroom: Enhancing students' self-efficacy and attitudes (2005) Computers and Education, 45, pp. 203-215; Mayer, R.E., Principles for reducing extraneous processing in multimedia learning: Coherence, signaling, redundancy, spatial contiguity, and temporal contiguity principles (2005) The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning, pp. 183-200. , R.

The project teams consist of up to seven students from mechanical-, electrical-, business-engineering and computer science. All teams have the same inputs and tasks varying from year to year - usually with mechatronics background. During two semesters the teams learn in a practical, hands-on way the different aspects in today's product development, such as: (customer) need finding - define - design/test - supply - produce - solution (product). The first semester is focusing on the need finding and definition phase, whereas the second semester is focusing on design loops including prototyping, test and supply. Students have to set-up all requirements and specifications for their individual solution, do the proof of concept and build up a functional prototype with a limited pre-defined budget. Another important aspect of this kind of engineering education is social networking and social aspects within the project framework. For validation a one-day competition is the final event of the engineering learning project. The basic teaching concept is presented. The advantages and limitations are discussed and explained with practical experiences from the last years and feedback from the participants, lecturers and the alumni network.","Active learning; Design education; Interdisciplinary engineering projects","Active Learning; Design Education; Engineering design education; Engineering project; Functional Prototypes; Interdisciplinary product development; Practical experience; University of applied science; Engineering education; Product design; Product development; Social aspects; Students","Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Art, Homepage, , http://english.hslu.ch, (English), Available, Accessed on 2013, 06 Feb; (2012) Lucerne School of Engineering and Architecture, Programme Guide Business Engineering 2013/2014, , English; (2004) VDI Guideline 2206, Design Methodology for Mechatronic Systems, , (German/English), Beuth Verlag, Berlin; Jenny, B., (2005) Projektmanagement: Das Wissen Für Eine Erfolgreiche Karriere, , (German), Vdf Hochschulverlag, Zürich; Gershenfeld, N.A., (2005) Fab: The Coming Revolution on your Desktop-from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication, , Basic Books, New York; Lucerne School of Engineering and Architecture, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuV_0830vc4, PREN final event (video), Available, Accessed on 2013, 06 Feb; Yew, E.H.J., Schmidt, H.G., What students learn in problem-based learning: A process analysis (2012) Instructional Science, 40 (2), pp. 371-395","Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and ArtsSwitzerland",,9781904670421,,"English","Proc.

To help address this need in postgraduate students - both recent graduates and those with several years of industry experience - a Professional Masters of Engineering (MEng) Design Certificate program was recently introduced in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. The program consists of a small core based on a design methods course and a two-course equivalent industry design project. The design methods course relies on a combination of lectures and a major project. Recently, the lectures have been increasingly supplemented with case studies, wherein students get to practice design.

The subsequent impact on both Product Design practice and pedagogy has been profound. These technologies present an opportunity to develop new approaches, and some would say revolutionise, the design and manufacturing of products; enabling greater design freedom, making the manufacture of what was impossible possible, reducing development time, accelerating time to market. Could it be however, that the wonder of 'growing' products direct from a vat of liquid resin or tub of powder has clouded our judgement in regard to AM and its place in Product Design curriculum? Using a number of commercially orientated case studies this paper briefly attempts to put additive technologies into context. It will explore where AM fits in terms of production volume and the development of high or low value products. The paper will attempt to identify where, at this moment in time, conventional manufacturing technologies still have to be taught in order to provide Product Design graduates with appropriate knowledge for today's manufacturing environments. In addition the paper will attempt to identify methods to reconcile the teaching of both AM and conventional manufacturing technologies and put into context opportunities for tool-less manufacturing for design graduates.","Additive manufacturing; Product design education; Rapid prototyping","Additive Manufacturing; Additive technology; Conventional manufacturing; Development time; Manufacturing environments; Manufacturing for designs; Product design educations; Production volumes; 3D printers; Curricula; Manufacture; Product design; Rapid prototyping; Technology; Engineering education","Hopkinson, N., Hague, R.J.M., Dickens, P.M., (2005) Rapid Manufacturing - An Industrial Revolution for the Digital Age, , Wiley, ISBN 0-470-01613-2; Sinha, A., New frontiers in manufacturing education Rapid prototyping, 3d scanning and reverse engineering (2009) ASEE Southeast Section Conference; Bohn, J.H., Integrating rapid prototyping into the engineering curriculum - A case study (1997) Rapid Prototyping Journal, 1 (3), pp. 32-37; Hopkinson, N., (2010) Additive Manufacturing What's Happening and Where are We Going with Printing in the Third Dimension?, , Becta, October 2010; Campbell, I., Bourell, D., Gibson, I., Additive manufacturing Rapid prototyping comes of age (2012) Rapid Prototyping Journal, 18 (4), pp. 255-258. , Iss; Tacket, E.C., Project based learning for higher education in additive manufacturing (2009) US - TURKEY Workshop on Rapid Technologies, , September 24 - 24; Wohlers, T., Grimm, T., Rapid production Key barriers to growth (2001) Perspectives Time-Compression Technologies, , www.wohlersassociates.com/Apr01TCT.htm, available at; Drizo, A., Pegna, J., Environmental impacts of rapid prototyping An overview of research to date (2006) Rapid Prototyping Journal, 12 (2), pp. 64-71; Reeves, P., Rapid manufacturing - A business case for developing reusable multimedia for engineering education (2007) International Symposium for Engineering Education, 2007, , Dublin City University, Ireland; Technology Strategy Board Web Site, , http://www.innovateuk.org/content/competition/inspiring-new-design- freedoms-in-additivemanufact.ashx, available at; Digital Manufacturing Report, , http://www.digitalmanufacturingreport.com/dmr/2012-11-21/ additive_manufacturing%E2%80%99s_dirty_secrets_exposed.html, available at; Loy, J., Supporting creative learning for rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing through lessons from creative learning for cnc routering and laser cutting technologies (2011) NZ Rapid Product Development Conference 2011, , February 7-8, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand; Campbell, R.I., De Beer, D.J., Barnard, L.J., Booysen, G.J., Truscott, M., Cain, R., Burton, M.J., Hague, R.J.M., Design evolution through customer interaction with functional prototypes (2007) Journal of Engineering Design, 18 (6), pp. 617-635; Dean, L., Titanium jewellery High-end decorative design straight from the machine (2008) Time Compression Technologies Conference, , UK, October; Dean, L., Additive manufacture Added design value (2012) ICAT 2012, 4th International Conference on Additive Technologies, , Slovenia.

The course was developed as part of a Higher Education Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (HESTEM) National Programme project and provides an opportunity for engineers to take higher education qualifications while remaining in full time employment. The first cohort have all progressed from part time, day release Foundation degree Science (FdSc's) at either another Higher Education Institution (HEI) or Bournemouth & Poole College (BPC) to take units at final year honours level. The development of online units for the MEng programme has been based on the Constructivist approach to learning and the delivery mechanism uses online learning materials delivered via a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). The paper details how each unit of study begins with a full day face to face tutorial on campus enabling an introduction to the subject as well as allowing 'faces to be put to names' thus mitigating the dehumanizing effect of pure online learning. It describes and evaluates how effective this is in 'kick starting' the student to student relationship that is essential for an effective learning community to develop. The paper also evaluates how the use of both staff/student and student/student online forums, throughout all units, allows for this community to further develop and enhance the learning experience. The paper concludes that the implementation of a constructivist approach to learning has been very successful for this new course and first cohort of students. This has enabled students to make the necessary transition and has resulted in a good depth of learning and engagement.","Engineering; Flexible learning; MEng; Online learning; Virtual learning environment","Bournemouth University; Constructivist approaches; Flexible Learning; Higher education institutions; MEng; Online learning; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Virtual learning environments; Computer aided instruction; Engineering; Engineering education; Product design; Students; Teaching; E-learning","Humphries-Smith, T., (2012) Development of a Collaborative, Distance Learning Based Route to BEng/MEng Qualifications for Engineers in Employment, , http://www.hestem.ac.uk/activity/development-collaborative-distance- learning-based-routebengmeng-qualifications-engineers, Accessed 12th November 2012 at; Theories of Learning and Teaching, , http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/InfoKits/effective-use-of-VLEs/ intro-to-VLEs/introtovleapproaches/introtovle-theories, Accessed 12th November 2012 at; Mayes, T., De Fraitas, S., (2004) JISC E-learning Models Desk Study, Stage 2 - Review of E-learning Theories, Frameworks and Models, , http://www.jisc.ac.uk/uploaded_documents/ Stage%202%20Learning%20Models%20(Version%201).pdf, Accessed 25th January 2013 at; Fry, N., Love, N., Business lecturers' perceptions and interactions with the virtual learning environment (2011) International Journal of Management Education, 9 (4), pp. 51-56. , http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/bmaf/documents/publications/ijme/ Vol9No4/IJME325.pdf, Accessed 25th January 2013 at; (2010) Code of Practice for the Assurance of Quality and Standards in Higher Education; Collaborative Provision and Flexible and Distributed Learning (Including Elearning), , Quality Assurance Agency (QAA).

If a system is to perform optimally, all of the component parts must communicate and cooperate effectively. Technologists must therefore have an appreciation for both, the functionality of a single component of that system and the interoperability, or impact of that component within the context of the system. Scientific first principles underpin all aspects of technical education. The application of scientific knowledge at component level impacts at system level. Practical or laboratory-based activity has long been used as a complimentary pedagogy to that of traditional lectures. Laboratory offerings are conventionally conducted on a single piece of apparatus or at component level, rather than at a system level. Interfaces which help convey scientific principles in action, within the context of a system, must thus be regarded as a demarcation in technical education delivery. This paper outlines the novel pedagogies developed by a UNESCO award winning European training initiative which created both hard and soft vehicles for learning, for level 5 learners on the European Qualification Framework. The paper describes an authentic systems-based laboratory interface to aid the lecturer in the dissemination of scientific principles, within the context of a system; as well as novel instructional modes designed to improve the soft skills of the learner. The paper further outlines, how the pedagogies developed, can be implemented within the learning curricula of higher level programmes within the wider engineering and product design community.","Systematic knowledge; Systematic learning; Systems approach","European qualifications; Scientific knowledge; Scientific principles; Systematic knowledge; Systematic learning; Systems approach; Technical educations; Technology education; Building components; Curricula; Engineering education; Interoperability; Personnel training; Product design; Teaching; Technical presentations; Learning systems","Williams, J.P., Design: The only methodology of technology?

Used at the beginning of the design process, it can generally lead to a reduction of iteration loops and an optimization of the weight/stiffness ratio. It has been argued that the application of TO could also be effective in the hands of industrial design. Moreover, TO could help to add plausibility to the theory of technical mechanics and structural concepts in design and engineering education. These benefits are not being utilized by a large share of potential users for mainly two reasons. Firstly, current commercial software involves a great financial invest. Secondly, an effective use of the software requires extensive training, which is the main hindrance against the method's application in conventional engineering education, where no time can be cut from the tight schedules to learn to operate additional software. However, in recent years, a range of rather basic, free TO software has become available on the internet. Starting the discussion if such offers are interesting options for engineering and design education and practice, this paper gives an overview of the functionality of current free TO software. Next, a specific case is studied with one commercial and several free TO programs. The investigation focuses on available functionalities for defining geometry and load cases as well as on the qualitative or quantitative rating of the optimized structures. The question of interest is if the disadvantages of the reduced performance of free software can be compensated by the advantages of saving time and budget and to what extent such freeware can be a feasible alternative to professional FEM-based software, especially in the context of enhancing engineering education and supporting designers.","Enhancing engineering education; Industrial design; Topology optimization","Commercial software; Engineering and design educations; Feasible alternatives; Optimized structures; Potential users; Structural concept; Structural parts; Weight/stiffness ratios; Application programs; Computer aided engineering; Engineering education; Iterative methods; Optimization; Shape optimization; Product design","Pahl, G., Beitz, W., Feldhusen, J., Grote, K.H., (2007) Engineering Design, , Springer, London; Brezing, A., Kämpf, A.-K., Feldhusen, J., Die rechnergestützte topologieoptimierung als ansatz zu unterstützung des industrial designs bei der gestaltung struktureller bauteile (2012) Gemeinsames Kolloquium Konstruktionstechnik/Symposium Technisches Design, , Dresden; Bendsøe, M.P., Sigmund, O., (2003) Topology Optimization: Theory, Methods, and Applications, , Springer, Berlin; Breitenberger, M., Strukturoptimierung, , http://www.femopt.de/index.php/de/kompetenzen/strukturoptimierung.html, Available, [Accessed on 2012, 12 Nov]; Rieg, F., Alber-Laukant, B., Hackenschmidt, R., (2012) Finite Elemente Analyse Für Ingenieure, , Hanser, München; Topology Optimization Guide, , http://www.topology-opt.com/, Available, [Acc. on 2013, 24 Jan]; Andreassen, E., Clausen, A., Schevenels, M., Lazarov, B.S., Sigmund, O., Efficient topology optimization in matlab using 88 lines of code (2011) Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 43, pp. 1-16; 3D Structural Topology Optimization with the SIMP Method, , http://www2.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~cmdl/download.htm, Available, [Accessed on 2013, 22 Jan]; Hunter, W., ToPy - 2D and 3D Topology Optimization Using Python, , http://code.google.com/p/topy/, Available, [Accessed on 2013, 15 Jan]; TopOpt Research Group, , http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/, Technical University of Denmark.

The classical mode and the oldest form of laboratory education is the hands-on mode. Advances in information and communication technologies have contributed to the laboratory education by creating two new modes, the simulated (virtual) mode and the online controlled mode (remote). Recently, developments or utilizations of hybrid structures of two types (e.g., virtual and hands-on, or remote and hands-on) have been reported in the literature; however, until now there are no reports of hybrid structures of the three types together. This paper describes the technical development of a novel laboratory model that combines the three modes in one unifying software package, namely the TriLab, by using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW). It is shown that LabVIEW provides a single programming environment for developing all components of the TriLab. Furthermore, it is shown that the Joomla web content management system can be used as a solution for efficient deployment of a remote lab online portal on the top of the LabVIEW core software. The development of the TriLab using LabVIEW and Joomla for an Instrumentation and Control Engineering Laboratory rig is shown. The analysis of student survey is presented which has shown positive impact of the pedagogical utilization of the TriLab. This is the first paper which aims to provide engineering academics a generic architecture and software solutions to rapidly develop their own TriLab. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Joomla; laboratory education; LabVIEW; the TriLab; virtual and remote labs","Computer programming languages; Education computing; Engineering education; Laboratories; Students; Joomla; Laboratory education; LabViEW; the TriLab; Virtual and remote labs; Distance education","Kirschner, P.A., Meester, M.A.M., The laboratory in higher science education, problems, premises, and objectives (1988) High Educ, 17, pp. 81-98; Dechsri, P., Heikkinen, H.W., Jones, L.L., Effect of a laboratory manual design incorporating visual information-processing aids on student learning and attitudes (1997) J Res Sci Teach, 34, pp. 891-904; Tan, K.K., Lee, T.H., Leu, F.M., Development of a distant laboratory using LabVIEW (2000) Int J Eng Educ, 16, pp. 273-282; Johnstone, A.H., Al-Shuaili, A., Learning in the laboratory; Some thoughts from the literature (2001) R Soc Chem, 5, pp. 42-91; Hofstein, A., Lunetta, V.N., The laboratory in science education: Foundations for the twenty-first century (2004) Lab Sci Educ, 88, pp. 28-54; Corter, J.E., Nickerson, J.V., Esche, S.K., Chassapis, C., Remote versus hands-on labs: A comparative study (2004) ASEE/IEEE Front Educ, 2, pp. 17-21; Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., The role of the laboratory in undergraduate engineering education (2005) J Eng Educ, 94, pp. 121-130; Ma, J., Nickerson, J.V., Hands-on, simulated, and remote laboratories: A comparative literature review (2006) ACM Comput Surv, 38, pp. 1-24; Chu, R.H., Lu, D.D., Project based lab learning teaching for power electronics and drives (2008) IEEE Trans Educ, 51, pp. 108-113; Blanchard, R.E., Moron-Garcia, S.D., Bates, M.R., Converting the physical to the virtual: Providing a laboratory experience for distance learners in engineering.

The course introduces modeling and simulation to solve biological/biomedical problems to students with a background in transport processes but with no prior experience in modeling. The critical elements needed to introduce such modeling to less experienced students are discussed, such as simplifying a problem for problem formulation, case studies that build a clear bridge to their preparation in fundamentals, and extracting important details from a simulation. The question of a black box versus a white box approach to presenting simulations is addressed. Active learning practices such as think-pair-share and distributed learning are introduced as enablers for this course. Student motivation has been increased by making the course student-centered with the students themselves selecting and executing the modeling projects. The authors describe how the same course can serve many purposes in a curriculum, including the introduction of a state-of-the-art design tool, extending fundamental knowledge to solve realistic problems, enhancing the fundamentals, introducing teamwork, written and oral communication, and design concepts. Although we have discussed the course in the context of biological/biomedical engineering, it can also be extended to other engineering curricula such as Mechanical and Chemical Engineering. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biomedical engineering; curriculum; design; modeling; transport processes","Biochemical engineering; Bioinformatics; Biomedical engineering; Design; Engineering education; Models; Students; Biological engineering; Distributed learning; Engineering curriculum; Model and simulation; Oral communication; Problem formulation; Student motivation; Transport process; Curricula","King, P.H., Fries, R.C., (2009) Design of Biomedical Devices and Systems, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida; (2006) A Report of the National Science Foundation Blue Ribbon Panel on Simulation-based Engineering Science, , http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/reports/sbes_final_report.pdf, NSF On the web; (2008) Integration of Simulation Technology into the Engineering Curriculum: A University-Industry Workshop, , http://www.mae.cornell.edu/swanson/workshop2008/, ISTEC July 25-26, 2008, at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York On the web at; Monroe, W.T., Mailander, M., Lima, M., Focus on experiential education: A freshman engineering program in biological engineering (2006) J Eng Educ, 22, pp. 1129-1138; Stern, F., Xing, T., Yarbrough, D.B., Rothmayer, A., Rajagopalan, G., Otta, S.P., Caughey, D., Moeykens, S., Hands-on CFD educational interface for engineering courses and laboratories (2006) J Eng Educ, 95, pp. 63-83; Bhatia, K.K., Application of finite element software to bridge the gap between hand calculations and experimental results in undergraduate heat transfer education (2009) Int J Eng Educ, 25, pp. 1092-1096; Smith, M.K., Computational fluid exploration as an engineering teaching tool (2009) Int J Eng Educ, 25, pp. 1129-1144; Johnson, A.T., The making of a new discipline (2006) Int J Eng Educ, 22, pp. 3-8; Linsenmeier, R.A., Gatchell, D.W., Core elements of an undergraduate biomedical engineering curriculum - State of the art and recommendations (2006) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Engineering Education, , July 23-28 San Juan, Puerto Rico; Datta, A.K., Rakesh, V., Teaching transport processes in biological engineering curricula: Past, present and future (2007) American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) Annual Meeting, , Minneapolis, Minnesota; Datta, A.K., (2010) Computer-aided Engineering: Application to Biomedical Processes, , http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/bee4530/, Course home page.

Some of its topics require a careful and detailed explanation from the instructor as they often involve theoretical concepts and somewhat complex mechanisms, demanding a certain degree of abstraction from the students if they are to gain a full understanding. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate the software tool Alg-OS. This software tool was designed to serve the learning purposes of the memory management and especially the page replacement algorithms operation to be used in the everyday OS classrooms. The undergraduate students can easily explore the operations of those algorithms through an interaction with Alg-OS user interface. More specifically, students can develop the operation way for each algorithm separately and learn from their mistakes that the software shows automatically in real time. All students performances stored in a database of Alg-OS. A total of 111 final-year undergraduate university students of the Department of Applied Informatics in Management and Economy, Technological Educational Institution of Messolonghi, Messolonghi, Greece were surveyed about their intention to use ""Alg-OS"" in their learning. The results showed that students had positive values indicating a tendency to be favorable towards using Alg-OS in their learning. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Alg-OS; instructional tool; operating systems; page replacement algorithms","Engineering education; Students; User interfaces; Complex mechanisms; Computer engineering curricula; Educational institutions; Instructional tool; Page replacement algorithms; Undergraduate students; University students; Web-based softwares; Computer operating systems","Downey, A.B., Teaching experimental design in an operating systems class (1999) Proc. 30th ACM SIGCSE; Wagner, T.D., Ressler, E.K., A practical approach to reinforcing concepts in introductory operating systems (1997) Proc. 28th ACM SIGCSE; Pérez-Dávila, A., OS bridge between academia and reality (1995) Proc. 26th ACM SIGCSE; Ramakrishman, S., Lancaster, A.M., Operating system projects: Linking theory, practice, and use (1993) Proc. 24th ACM SIGCSE; Maia, L.P., Berenger Machado, F., Pacheco Jr., A.C., (2005) Constructivist Framework for Operating Systems Education: A Pedagogic Proposal Using the SOsim, ITiCSE'05, , Monte de Caparica, Portugal; Tanenbaum, A.S., Woodhull, A.S., (1997) Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, , 2nd edition, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Comer, D., (1984) Operating System Design - The XINU Approach, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; http://www.freebsd.org/, FreeBSD; http://www.linux.org/, Linux; Bynum, B., Camp, T., (1999) After You, Alfonse: A Mutual Exclusion Toolkit - An Introduction to BACI, , http://www.mines.edu/fs_home/tcamp/baci/; Anderson, T.E., Christopher, W.A., Procter, S.J., (1999) The Nachos Instructional Operating System, , http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tom/nachos/; Kifer, M., Smolka, S., (1991) OSP: An Environment for Operating Systems (Instructor Version), , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Jones, D., Newman, A., (2001) RCOS java: A Simulated Operating System with Animations, , http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Publications/Papers_and_Books/RCOS. java/; MOSS Memory Management Simulator, , http://www.ontko.com/moss/memory/memory.exe; Ontko, R., MOSS Memory Management Simulator User Guide, , http://www.ontko.com/moss/memory/user_guide.html; Tanenbaum, A., (2001) Modern Operating Systems, , 2nd edition, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Maia, L., Pacheco, A., A simulator supporting lectures on operating systems (2003) 33rd ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conf., , Boulder, CO; Buendia, F., Cano, J.C., WebgeneOS: A generative and web-based learning, architecture to teach operating systems in undergraduate courses (2006) IEEE Trans Educ, 49; Tartaglia, A., Tresso, E., An automatic evaluation system for technical education at the university level (2002) IEEE Trans Educ, 45, pp. 268-275; Malmi, L., Korhonen, A., Saikkonen, R., Experiences in automtic assessment on mass courses and issues for designing virtual courses (2002) 7th Ann.

A number of studies have suggested that there is a difference in males' and females' achievement and attitudes relating to computer use. Due to the gender differences in learners' achievement and attitudes according to computer use, this study investigated the gender differences in visual presentation e-learning based on an engineering drawing course. Through literature review, expert panel discussion and experimental design, the one-group pre-test/post-test experimental teaching was conducted within an eight week (three hours per week) period. Before and after the experimental teaching, the vocational high school students' learning achievement and learning attitudes were investigated. Data were analysed by using descriptive statistics, a paired-samples t-test, an independent-samples t-test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The findings could lead to improved understanding of the gender differences in visual presentation learning. © 2013 WIETE.",,"Analysis of covariances; Descriptive statistics; Engineering drawing; Experimental teachings; Gender differences; High school students; Learning achievement; Visual presentation; E-learning; Regression analysis; Engineering education","Kim, S., Song, S.M., Yoon, Y.I., Smart learning services based on smart cloud computing (2011) Sensors, 11 (8), pp. 7835-7850; Cobos-Moyano, A., Martín-Blas, T., Oñate-Gómez, C., Evaluating background and prior knowledge: a case study on engineering graphics learning (2009) Computers & Educ, 53 (3), pp. 695-700; Scheiter, K., Gerjets, P., Huk, T., Imhof, B., Kammerer, Y., The effects of realism in learning with dynamic visualizations (2009) Learning and Instruction, 19 (6), pp. 481-494; Colln, M.C., Kusch, K., Helmert, J.R., Kohler, P., Velichkovsky, B.M., Pannasch, S., Comparing two types of engineering visualizations: task-related manipulations matter (2012) Applied Ergonomics, 43 (1), pp. 48-56; Mayer, R.E., Bove, W., Bryman, A., Mars, R., Tapangco, L., When less is more: meaningful learning from visual and verbal summaries of science textbook lessons (1996) J. of Educational Psychology, 88 (1), p. 64; Cook, M.P., Visual representations in science education: the influence of prior knowledge and cognitive load theory on instructional design principles (2006) Science Educ, 90 (6), pp. 1073-1091; Pöhnl, S., Bogner, F.X., Learning with computer-based multimedia: gender effects on efficiency (2012) J. of Educational Computing Research, 47 (4), pp. 387-407; Rosander, P., Bäckström, M., The unique contribution of learning approaches to academic performance, after controlling for IQ and personality: are there gender differences?

The main purpose of the questionnaires is to determine whether there are any trends regarding the strategies and methods that are used to teach and apply the design process. From the curriculum documents for public schools in South Africa it is clear that the design process is considered to be an important aspect in a wide variety of subjects. In particular design is considered to be the backbone learning outcome of the Technology Learning Area. This prominence given to the design process in the South African school curriculum prompted this research project. A questionnaire was structured to accommodate individual teachers and lecturers who are teaching the design process according to the Technology section of the national curriculum statement of the South African Department of Basic Education. A separate questionnaire was structured to accommodate individual design practitioners. Regarding teaching the design process, teachers tend to closely follow the prescriptions of the school curriculum, lecturers tend to allow room for different interpretations and design practitioners tend to accommodate a range of approaches when applying the design process. Although the results revealed by the questionnaires are a reflection of the teaching practices of a limited group in a particular setting some knowledge transfer to similar situations should be possible. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Design process; Teaching practice; Technological process; Technology education; Trends","Design process; Teaching practices; Technological process; Technology education; Trends; Curricula; Design; Knowledge management; Surveys; Teaching; Technology; Engineering education","Adiels, L., Where did technology go?

We implemented this approach in a context where the learner inquires into a biological phenomenon and develops its representation in the form of a robotic model. Our multi-case study involved middle school students and prospective teachers. We considered learning processes, in which the learners used PicoCricket robot construction kits to create a variety of bio-inspired robotic models. We present two such models and the teaching strategy which organizes modeling activities into five learning stages. Based on analysis of learning activities and their outcomes along with the studied cases, we explored characteristics of the learning environment and of the proposed integrative teaching approach. The findings indicate the potential of modeling as a thread, tying together engineering design and scientific inquiry into an integrative learning activity. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biological system; Design; Inquiry; Modeling; PicoCricket; Robotics; Science-technology education","Bio-inspired robotics; Biological phenomena; Inquiry; Integrative learning; Learning environments; Middle school students; PicoCricket; Teaching approaches; Computer aided instruction; Design; Education computing; Engineering education; Models; Robotics; Biological systems","Cianchi, M., (1988) Leonardo da Vinci ' S Machines, pp. 45-61. , Florence: Becocci; De Vries, M.J., Book review: John K.

Moreover, the number of engineering enrollments has been declining in recent years. The purpose of this study is to improve both the level of knowledge and skills of students upon entrance into engineering programs and their general opinion about engineering studies. The aim is to establish the importance of proper coordination between groups involved in the overall educational process and to avoid, at least in part, the decline in recent engineering enrollments. The project had the following four phases: (1) determination of the freshmen's weakest concepts; (2) assessment of high schools students' knowledge; (3) development of educational activities; and (4) re-assessment of high school students. These measures were complemented with the high school teachers' opinions about the students improvements and analyses of the evolution of engineering enrollments. Most of the participants significantly improved their knowledge and skills. Similarly, high school teachers believed that the attitude of the students toward engineering improved significantly. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Educational activities; Engineering education; Engineering outreach; K-12 partnership","Educational activities; Engineering enrollments; Engineering outreach; High school students; High school teachers; High schools students; K-12 partnership; Organisation for economic co-operation and development; Engineering; Engineering education; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Students","(2008) Informe Graduados, , http://www.aneca.es/media/151855/informes-reflex-graduados.pdf, ANECA Titulados Universitarios y Mercado Laboral.

Ten graduate students, including current and future technology teachers, participated in a required technology graduate course that used scientific detective videos as a pedagogical tool to motivate their interest in science and technology and to reinforce creative competence in designing technology learning activities (TLAs). The participants watched three scientific detective videos and analyzed them for scientific principles and technologies. An analysis report and interview were conducted to collect participants' understanding and application of scientific principles and technologies. The main findings were that (a) influencing teacher's design of TLAs through scientific detective videos is feasible; (b) prior personal conditions and external factors influence teacher's design of TLAs; and (c) the analysis of scientific detective videos helps teachers to design TLAs appropriately. This study demonstrated the broad utility of scientific detective videos for inspiring technology teachers to integrate science and technology in their activity design. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Scientific detective video; Technology activity design; Technology learning activity","Future technologies; Graduate students; Pedagogical tools; Science and Technology; Scientific detectives; Scientific principles; Technology graduates; Technology learning; Design; Students; Teaching; Technology; Engineering education","Anderson, O.R., A neurocognitive perspective on current learning theory and science instructional strategies (1996) Science Education, 81, pp. 67-89. , 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199701)81:1<67: AID-SCE4>3.0.CO;2-#; Black, P., Harrison, G., (1985) Place of Confusion: Technology and Science in the School Curriculum, , The Nuffield-Chelsea Curriculum Trust/The National Centre for School Technology, Trent Polytechnic London; Brake, M., Thornton, R., Science fiction in the classroom (2003) Physics Education, 38 (1), pp. 31-34. , 10.1088/0031-9120/38/1/305; Dubeck, L.W., Moshier, S.E., Boss, J.E., (2004) Fantastic Voyages: Learning Science Through Science Fiction Films, , 2 Springer New York; Efthimiou, C., Llewellyn, R.A., Cinema as a tool for science literacy (2004) Physics Education, 16 (1), pp. 1-13; Fleer, M., Working technologically: Investigations into how young children design and make during technology education (2000) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 10 (1), pp. 43-59. , 10.1023/A:1008923410441; Hanson, D., Burton, D., Guam, G., Six Concepts to help you align with NCLB (2006) The Technology Teacher, 65 (1), pp. 17-20; Ihde, D., The structure of technology knowledge (1997) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 7 (1), pp. 73-79. , 10.1023/A:1008809019482; Kimbell, R., Stables, K., Green, R., The nature and purpose of design and technology (2002) Teaching Design and Technology in Secondary Schools, pp. 19-30. , G.

In early 20th century Sweden, elementary education, including textbooks and literature that were used in teaching, accounted for the main mediation of technological knowledge to schoolchildren. An investigation of children's literature for schools is therefore important in order to understand what was considered worth knowing about technology at the time. The aim of this article is therefore to analyse the representations of technology and attitudes towards technology that were mediated through two children's fiction books in Swedish elementary school libraries in the 1910s. We have limited the analysis of empirical material to the books Technical Stories for Young and Old (Tekniska sagor för stora och små, 1914) and Technical Stories of the War for Young and Old (Krigets tekniska sagor för stora och små, 1915) by the Swedish inventor, author and technology educator Otto Witt. Gauging Witt's influence on the schoolchildren and educators of his time is very difficult, but in this first English-language article on his ""technical stories"" one can conclude that he was in many ways unique and probably fairly well-read in the schools of early 20th century Sweden and onward. He was also a particularly perceptive forerunner of today's technology and science educators in his use of anthropomorphism as an educational tool. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Children's fiction books; History; Otto Witt; Technology education","Children's fiction books; Educational tools; Elementary education; Elementary schools; Otto Witt; School libraries; Technological knowledge; Technology education; History; Libraries; Technology; Engineering education","Letter from Witt to von Heidenstam, 1 January 1916, Brevskrivarregistret, Linköpings Stiftsbibliotek, Övralidsarkivet, E005/1984:5; Riksarkivet, SVAR, Oscars kyrkoarkiv, Död- och begravningsbö cker, SE/SSA/6025/F I/4, 1923-1927; Alvesson, M., Sköldberg, K., (2008) Tolkning Och Reflektion.

The students have to conduct significant projects and cope with realistic working conditions and scenarios. PBL is generally done by groups of students working together towards a common goal. Several factors play a significant role on the final success of each group. It is not only the technical aspects that have an influence on their final achievements, but also the human aspects and group dynamics. These dynamics can be studied through personality assessments, the Myers-Brigss Type Indicator (MBTI) being one of the most used and well-known methods. The MBTI is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. Although MBTI strictly speaking just only identifies a personality type of an individual, it taps into key aspects of personality and behavior in areas such as communication, problem solving, decision making, and interpersonal relations. Several studies have also related MBTI profiles with leadership styles. The MBTI also helps in understanding group dynamics, analyzing shortcomings in an individual's style and how the style affects the group as a whole. MBTI has been widely used in Team Building, Conflict Resolutions, Communication Skills and Understanding. The purpose of this work is to study how different combinations of student profiles could explain different group dynamics and at the same time, to predict the final success in a group. Knowing more about the personality of the team members, their leadership styles and how different personalities get along or conflict with each other can be useful information for building successful PBL groups. To this purpose, the final results of eight different student groups are analyzed, studying the influence of the MBTI profiles of their members with the group success. The final results obtained in this study suggest that the leadership style associated with the profile of the student playing the role of group coordinator and the members' profile combinations have an influence on the group's success. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Engineering education; MBTI; Personality; Project success; Project-based learning; Teaming","MBTI; Personality; Project based learning; Project success; Teaming; Behavioral research; Communication; Dynamics; Engineering education; Management; Students","Berens, L.V., (2001) Quick Guide to the 16 Personality Types in Organizations: Understanding Personality Differences in the Workplace, , Huntington Beach, California: Telos Publications; Bernold, L.E., Bingham, W.L., McDonald, P.H., Attia, T.M., Impact of holistic and learning-oriented teaching on academic success (2000) Journal of Engineering Education, 89 (2), pp. 191-200. , 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00513.x; Bradley, J.H., Hebert, F.J., The effect of personality type on team performance (1997) Journal of Management Development, 16 (5), pp. 337-353. , 10.1108/02621719710174525 10.1108/02621719710174525; Carr, M., Curd, J., Dent, F., (2004) MBTI Research into Distribution of Type, , Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire HP4 1NS, UK: Ashridge Faculty Publications; Christy, A.D., Lima, M., The use of student portfolios in engineering instruction (1998) Journal of Engineering Education, 87, pp. 143-148. , 10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00334.x; Church, A.H., Waclawski, J., The relationship between individual personality orientation and executive leadership behaviour (1998) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 71 (2), pp. 99-125. , 10.1111/j.2044-8325.1998.tb00666.x 10.1111/j.2044-8325.1998.tb00666.x; Clinebell, S., Stecher, M., Teaching teams to be teams: An exercise using the Myers-Briggs ® type indicator and the five-factor personality traits (2003) Journal of Management Education, 27 (3), pp. 362-383. , 10.1177/1052562903027003006 10.1177/1052562903027003006; Denton, H.G., Group task management: A key element in technology across the curriculum (1991) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 1 (3), pp. 136-140. , 10.1007/BF00819646 10.1007/BF00819646; Denton, H.G., The role of group/team work in design and technology: Some possibilities and problems (1994) En Teaching Technology, pp. 144-151. , Routledge; Doppelt, Y., Implementation and assessment of project-based learning in a flexible environment (2003) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 13 (3), pp. 255-272. , 10.1023/A:1026125427344 10.1023/A:1026125427344; Dym, C.L., Agogino, A.M., Frey, D.D., Leifer, L.J., Engineering design thinking, teaching, and learning (2005) En Journal of Engineering Education, , Citeseer; http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-policy/doc48_en.htm, European Commission-Education & Training-lifelong learning policy-European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).

The timing of this study is significant. Over a decade of review and adjustment to the Technology curriculum, leading to the new learning area of Technology in the New Zealand curriculum, Ministry of Education (2007), has caused many teachers in New Zealand schools to retrench to an earlier approach or make their own interpretation of curricular requirements. This situation in schools created the need for those involved with pre-service teacher education to prepare programmes that signpost pitfalls while building on students' own strengths and those of the curriculum to cope with the wide variety of interpretation and pedagogical approach of school communities.

The critical reflection draws on the responses of approximately 120 South African technology education teachers in a teaching practice workbook where they had to choose a project and base five lessons on the project. The analysis of the above mentioned lesson plans is done in such a way that the linking of learning activities and assessment activities to learning outcomes and assessment standards is highlighted. In general it can be concluded that, although the learning outcomes and assessment standards are readily available and specified clearly in the policy documents of the national department of education, the particular teachers find it difficult to translate theory into practice when converting what is specified in the policy documents to learning activities and assessment activities in their lesson plans. This implies that the instructional strategy for the particular technology education programme should be adapted to include a comprehensive section on how to integrate aspects mentioned in the policy documents of the national department of education into actual lesson plans. Although the outcomes of the critical reflection on the results of the analysis mentioned above are directed at improving and adapting an instructional strategy in a particular in-service technology education programme in South Africa some knowledge transfer to similar situations should be possible. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Assessment activities; Assessment standards; Learning activities; Learning outcomes; Technology education","Assessment activities; Department of Education; In-service technology; Instructional strategy; Learning Activity; Learning outcome; Teaching technologies; Technology education; Knowledge management; Planning; Standards; Teaching; Technology; Engineering education","Ankiewicz, P., Van Rensburg, S., Myburgh, C., Assessing the attitudinal technology profile of South African learners: A pilot study (2001) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 11, pp. 93-109. , 10.1023/A:1011210013642; Banks, F., Barlex, D., Owen-Jackson, G., Rutland, M., Järvinen, E., Findings of an international teacher training research study: The DEPTH project (2000) Proceedings PATT-10 Conference, , http://www.iteawww.org/PATT10/PATT10.pdf, Accessed 15 Jan 2011; Barbutiu, S.M., Developing teaching in technology - From isolation to cooperation (2009) Proceedings PATT-22 Conference, , http://www.iteawww.org/PATT22/PATT22.pdf, Accessed 15 Jan 2011; Barlex, D., Rutland, M., Developing trainee teachers' ability to teach designing within secondary school design & technology in England (2004) Proceedings PATT-14 Conference, , http://www.iteawww.org/PATT14/PATT14.pdf, Accessed 15 Jan 2011; Chisholm, L., (2000) A South African Curriculum for the Twenty First Century - Report of the Review Committee on Curriculum 2005, , Department of Education Pretoria; De Vries, M.J., The nature of technological knowledge: Philosophical reflections and educational consequences (2003) PATT 13 Conference Proceedings, pp. 83-86. , 21-24 July 2003; De Vries, M.J., (2005) Teaching about Technology, , Springer Berlin; (2010) Curriculum News 2, May 2010, , Department of Basic Education Department of Basic Education Pretoria; (2011) Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement for Technology.

Brown Building, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2125, United States","Presented in this paper is a description of the guest speaker series model established in a long-standing civil engineering course at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. In the Winter 2010 semester, the author launched an industry based guest speaker series called People I Wish I had Met Before Graduating™ to further enrich the educational experience of students in CEE 431, Construction Contracting. Success of the series based on student testimonials and surveys led to its recognition by the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department as a valuable resource and its utilization by fellow faculty in CEE 431 and other departmental initiatives. Among the contributions of the speaker series are the creation of a faculty resource containing a description of the series and its correlation with the curriculum and course objectives, a library of speaker topics relevant to professionals and academiciansinthe industry, arosterofspeakers and established key talking points, a template for a student resource packet, and a survey. Typically, speaker series are offered in seminar-type courses. The model presented in this paper differs in that the speaker series had to be selectively assembled and incorporated into a traditional course with a specific, pre-defined curriculum such that it became an integral and meaningful part of the overall educational experience. This was the first time aguest speaker series had been established for CEE 431 at the University of Michigan, representing a significant change to the standards of practice. There is no documentation available to verify how widespread this practice is for comparable courses at other institutions, suggesting that it is uncommon. The following sections discuss the rationale behind the speaker series; provide a course description, including, curriculum and objectives; describe the speaker series model, including topics, structure and, the series application by others; present students' assessment of the series through testimonials and surveys; and offer conclusions. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Construction contracting; Construction engineering and management; Engineering education; Industry guest speakers","Civil and Environmental Engineering Department; Construction engineering; Course objectives; Educational experiences; Engineering course; Industry based; Traditional course; University of Michigan; Civil engineering; Curricula; Engineering education; Industry; Students; Surveys; Teaching","(1994) Engineering Education for a Changing World, Report of an ASEE Workshop for the Engineering Deans Council and Corporate Roundtable, , American Society for Engineering Education, Oct; Hoyt, D.P., Lee, E., Teaching ""Styles,"" and learning outcomes (2002) IDEA Research Report IDEA-RR-4, , IDEA Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, Nov; Finelli, C.J., Klinger, A., Budny, D.D., Strategies for improving the classroom environment (2001) Journal of Engineering Education, 90 (4), pp. 491-497; Brown, M.K., Hershock, C., Finelli, C.J., O'Neal, C., (2009) Teaching for Retention in Science, Engineering, and Match Disciplines: A Guide for Faculty, , Occasional Paper No. 25, Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Prince, M., Does active learning work?

Imagination should be cultivated in the process of preparing future engineers. This study develops an imagination instructional model for entry-level engineering college students. Three features of imagination: possibility, connectivity and boundary-crossing, are established as the theoretical basis for an instructional model called IDEAL. This model was implemented in an introductory engineering course and its effect was evaluated. The results showed that: (i) The IDEAL model significantly increased students' overall imagination, and more especially, (ii) it significantly enhanced students' boundary-crossing capacity. This study makes contributions to current engineering education by first exploring the inherent features of imagination, constructing a workable instructional model for the cultivation of imagination, implementing the model to an introductory engineering course and showing its effect. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Boundary-crossing;

The testing of this creativity model included presentations in two conferences of the International Multi-Conference on Engineering and Technological Innovation (IMETI) organised under the auspices of the International Institute of Informatics and Systematics (IIIS) and received excellent reviews (an average of 85%). The effectiveness of this creativity model in developing students' creative abilities was also tested on twenty-four, final-year Process Instrumentation undergraduates after two iterative pilot studies. The pre- and post-test results derived from evaluating students' creative abilities through the standardised Torrance's Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) show significance as measured through the t-test. Given the establishment of statistical significance in this study, it can reasonably be inferred that the TRIZ-based Creativity model with its leveraging of the university-industry nexus had a positive effect on increasing undergraduates' creative abilities and sets conducive conditions for students' innovativeness. The design and testing of this creativity model needs to be understood within the framework of the emerging synergistic connection among universities, industry and government which seeks to drive greater innovation and technological advancements for which the university-industry nexus was accentuated in this study. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Creativity; Engineering Education; Innovation; TRIZ; TTCT","Creativity; Process instrumentation; Statistical significance; Synergistic connections; Technological advancement; Technological innovation; TRIZ; TTCT; Engineering education; Industry; Innovation; Students","Beder, T., Beyond technicalities: Expanding engineering thinking (1999) Professional Issues in Engineering, 125 (1), pp. 12-18; Ernest, E., Peden, I., Realizing the new paradigm for engineering education (1998) Engineering Education Conference Proceedings, 1 (1), pp. 1-14; Kemnitzer, S., Creativity in Engineering Education: Preparing Students for the Twenty First Century, , www.engnet, Accessed on 21/05/2007; Bitcon, J., Survey heralds new job prospects for engineers (1999) IEAUSTMedia, pp. 34-43; Etzkowitz, H., Dzisah, J., Ranga, M., Zhou, C., The triple helix model for innovation: University-industry-government interaction (2007) Tech Monitor, pp. 14-23; Rantanen, K., Domb, E., (2002) Simplified TRIZ: New Problem-solving Applications for Engineers and Manufacturing Professionals, , St. Lucie Press, London; Savransky, S., (2000) Engineering of Creativity, , CRC Press, New York; Altshuller, G., (1973) Innovation Algorithm, , Technical Innovation Center, Worcester, MA; Altshuller, G., (1984) Creativity as an Exact Science, , Gordon and Breach Science Publishing, New York; Altshuller, G., (1994) And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared, , Technical Innovation Center, Worcester, MA; Polivinkin, A., (1985) Laws of Organisation and Evolution of Technique, , VPI, Volgorad; Polivinkin, A., (1991) Theory of New Technique Design: Laws of Technical Systems and their Applications, , Informelektro, Moscow; McGregor, D., Theory, X., Theory, Y., (2002) Workforce, 8 (1), pp. 32-34; Korten, D.C., (1995) When Corporations Rule the World, , Kumarian Press, West Hardford; Castells, M., (2001) Challenges of Globalization: South African Debates with Manuel Castells, , M.

Previous researchers found that students who choose a co-operative education achieve higher Grade Point Average (GPA) and emphasized the role of a student's professional experience in meeting the non-technical engineering skills criteria of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). In this research, an effort is made to show the degree of achievement of both technical and non-technical skills expected from the program's graduates. The graduates' data are analyzed using descriptive statistics. We show the differences between the genders' choice of co-op or Senior Design Project (SDP) option as well as their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and the achievement of ABET criteria. The results show that more than 50%of the students choose the co-op over the SDP option and this number has been increasing over the last few years. Knowing that UAE society is composed mostly of expatriates of many different nationalities, we have analyzed the choice of students based on their nationalities and found that the co-op is the favorite choice for Emirati students with an over whelming female majority (92%), while Expatriate students favored the SDP option. Our results confirm other findings in the literature in terms of CGPA and achievement of learning outcomes. For example, the CGPA was higher for students who choose the co-op (2.95 out of 4) than for the SDP students (2.70 out of 4). The students' achievement of the ABET criteria was almost 9% higher for co-op students compared with that for SDP students. Based on these results, we are recommending the implementation of co-operative education in other engineering programs in the University of Sharjah. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Co-operative education; Industrial engineering; Student learning outcomes","Accreditation board for engineering and technologies; Cooperative education; Cumulative grade point averages; Descriptive statistics; Non-technical skills; Professional experiences; Senior Design project; Student learning outcomes; Engineering education; Industrial engineering; Research; Students","Burnet, G., Greisch, J.R., The ten most outstanding engineering education and engineering technology achievements of the past century (1994) Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 3-5; Gardner, P.D., Nixon, D.C., Motschenbacker, G., Starting salary outcomes of co-operative education graduates (1992) Journal of Cooperative Education, 27 (3), pp. 16-26; Alwell, A., An evaluation of the marymount college cooperative experiential education program (1977) Journal of Cooperative Education, 14, pp. 34-41; Jagacinski, C.M., LeBold, W.K., Linden, K.W., Shell, K.D., The relationship between undergraduate work experience and job placement of engineers (1986) Engineering Education, 76 (4), pp. 232-236; Kysor, D.V., Pierce, M.A., Does intern/co-op experience translate into career progress and satisfaction?

Practical projects, in particular, defined as university-industry collaborations provide the potential of being very beneficial especially in graduate education: in such realistic project settings, students can experience real-life software engineering challenges and achieve learning objectives that go beyond typical learning objectives of practical assignments during classes or even practical projects defined by facultymembers. However, such collaborative projects havetobeplanned carefully and alsocome with various challenges. In this article, authors from academia and industry share their experiences gained during a history of successfully conducted collaborative projects. These experiences comprise objectives, benefits, challenges and lessons learned both from an educational viewpoint (i.e., students, supervisors), research viewpoint (supervisors), and industry viewpoint (customer).

Based on this work, the authors have developed a model to integrate this subject in engineering education. The research found out the need for additional layers of complexity inthe education ofengineers. Specifically, engineers need to acquire the corresponding technical competences, the ability to apply them in transportation systems, the transversal integrated competences, and how all this relates to sustainability values. Truthful to their rolein society, engineering schools should be centres of debate for the elaboration of technical solutions to current sustainability problems.

The PROLIDER has gained importance with its partners because it assists engineering students to develop leadership and management skills still during their undergraduate course. Since 1999, approximately 150 engineering students from two public universities located in Sao Carlos, Brazil (250km far from Sao Paulo City) have taken part in this Program. The undergraduate students are usually involved in the program during the last year of their course and are employed as trainees by the partner companies, which provide financial support for the program. At the end of each year of the program and after finishing their engineering degree, the students are ready to be employed by these companies as engineers (junior analysts, consultants, etc.). The retention rate is extremely high during the transition of the students from the program to the companies that participate in each yearly program. After some years, it is normal that some engineers change their jobs, but the retention rate still remains satisfactory. The industry partners of the program have also observed a faster development of these newcomer engineers in order to assume management and leadership roles. In general, the program benefits engineering students in terms of intensive development in leadership and managerial skills. The program also has a positive impact on students because it encourages discussion to improve the curricula of the engineering courses of the Sao Carlos School of Engineering at the University of Sao Paulo including more leadership skills content. Companies are also benefited by the program as there are more prepared newcomer engineers for their strategic job positions. Researchers can also obtain results from this program by doing multidisciplinary research in areas such as engineering education in leadership, leadership development for engineers, and so on. Therefore, universities and engineering courses should encourage professors and researchers to pay more attention to this kind of initiative that demands time and effort. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Leadership; Leadership development program in engineering","Brazilian companies; Leadership; Leadership development; Multi-disciplinary research; Public universities; School of engineering; Undergraduate Courses; Undergraduate students; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Industry; Management science; Research; Technical presentations; Students","Russell, J.S., Yao, J.T.P., Education conference delivers initiatives (1996) Journal of Management in Engineering, ASCE, 12 (6), pp. 17-26. , Nov.-Dec; Korte, R.F., How newcomers learn the social normsofan organization: A case study of the socialization of newly hired engineers (2009) Human Resource Development Quarterly, 20 (3), pp. 285-305. , Fall; Ponsa, P., Manresa-Yee, C., Arellano, D., J.

Salient features of the field trip pedagogical literature from K-12 and science education are aligned as research goals. They emphasize that field trips need to involve curriculum links, follow-up, clear purpose, and active learning. They also affirm that field trips have the ability to yield social and affective learning, holistic learning in a dynamic system, long-term memory, and learning anchors. These goals are mobilized here by implementing Dewey's experiential continuum with Deming's plan-do-check-act cycle and constructive alignment. This teaching-learning methodology is tested with a case study: a Manufacturing Processes Design class of 17 undergraduate, industrial engineering students in an accredited engineering program. The research results, which span a semester, are aligned to evidence the literature goals along with additional academia-industry collaboration benefits from a student learning perspective. These added benefits include studentengagement, deeplearning (including affective learning), joyinlearning, and community synergy. Thus, learning value for students is yielded from the proposed, rigorous framework for industrial field trips in engineering education; the framework accomplishes scholarly alignment with pedagogical literature in parallel with empirical results that ensure successful application in a pragmatic manner. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Community learning space; Constructive alignment; Experiential learning; Industrial field trips; Plan-do-check-act cycle","Community learning; Constructive alignments; Experiential learning; Industrial fields; Plan do check acts; Alignment; Curricula; Industrial engineering; Industry; Research; Software testing; Students; Engineering education","Bickford, D.J., Wright, D.J., Community: The hidden context for learning (2006) Learning Spaces, pp. 41-422. , D.

Based on a formalized tripartite cooperation between a student, an enterprise and a Danish university, the programme combines traditional academic curricula with a mentor company. Drawing on the concepts of Mode 2 knowledge production and knowledge governance the circumstances under which these innovations can take place are described and analysed. The empirical material is taken from a longitudinal study (2009-2011) of the master programme; the study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Both students and enterprises assess the master programme very positively and more than half of the companies confirmed that the students have contributed to innovation processes. The analysis shows how formal and informal governance mechanisms need to complement each other in order to enable a successful progression for all the parties involved. However the study also underlines that the master programme faces challenges which are usually not partofengineering curricula, for example, improving students' social and communication competences and autonomy. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Innovation; Knowledge governance; Mentorship; Mode 2","Governance mechanisms; Innovation process; Knowledge governance; Knowledge production; Longitudinal study; Mentorship; Mode 2; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Curricula; Engineering education; Innovation; Students; Industry","Lundvall, B.-A., (2009) Towards Developmental University Systems, , Aalborg University, Department of Business Studies Working Paper Series No. 5; Gregersen, B., Linde, L.T., Rasmussen, J.G., Linking between danish universities and society (2009) Science and Public Policy, 36 (2), pp. 151-156; Jørgensen, U., Valderrama, A., Entrepreneurship and response strategies to challenges in engineering and design education (2012) International Journal of Engineering Education, 28 (2), pp. 407-415; Gibbons, M., Limoges, Nowotny, H., Schwartzmann, S., Scott, P., Trow, M., The new production of knowledge (1994) The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies, , SAGE, London; Nowotny, H., Gibbons, M., Scott, P., (2001) Re-thinking Science-Knowledge and the Public in an Age Ofuncertainty, , Polity Press, Oxford; Etzkowich, H., Leydersdorf, L., The dynamics of innovation: From national systems and ""Mode2,"" to a triple helix of university-industry-government relations (2000) Research Policy, 29, pp. 109-123; Griffiths, R., Knowledge production and the research-teaching nexus: The case of the built environment disciplines (2004) Studies in Higher Education, 29 (6), pp. 709-726; Lam, A., University-industry collaboration: Careers and knowledge governance in hybrid organizational space (2011) Int.

An important challenge is the effective use of computer tools that allow associating teaching methods with the new ways students learn. In the area of power electronics, recognizing different concepts of switching converters is simplified, given simulation and experimentation tools. Nevertheless, general-purpose tools applied in the analysis and simulation of power electronics systems do not make use of the full interactivity that computer applications can offer. Consequently, it is necessary to develop modern tools with specific capacities to complement teaching and research experiences in power electronics.

The paper proposes an integrative approach for digital systems description and digital systems design teaching, both for computer engineering and electrical engineering students. This approach combines together the main aspects of the above two paradigms. The central concept of the new approach is a split flowchart. The proposed approach enables a parallel representation of the description of digital system functional fragments that in turn can be described procedurally.

Students are familiar with the sharp amplitude peak or trough normally occurring at resonance. This observation is not only intuitively pleasing, but also consistent with the concept of resonance in many physical systems. In the well-known series and parallel RLC circuits, the maximum and minimum currents, respectively, occur at resonance. Because of this, many students and even instructors (sometimes) may erroneously assume that the resonance in general RLC circuits implies maximum or minimum current. In this paper, it will be shown that this is generally untrue. The theoretical analyses and experimental validation of series, parallel and series-parallel RLC circuits are presented to address this common misconception. © Manchester University Press.","engineering education; frequency response; resonance; RLC circuits","Circuit resonance; Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Engineering education; Frequency response; Resonance; Students; Timing circuits; Electrical circuit; Experimental validations; Frequency response characteristic; Passive elements; Physical systems; RLC circuit; Series-parallel; Undergraduate students; Resonant circuits","Gluskin, E., Shmilovitz, D., The 'a + b' argument for teaching resonance (2011) Int.

Industrial and organizational psychologists study teams in the industry settings for which we prepare students, yet this research does not effectively inform engineering education. Purpose: This research review sought to demonstrate the relevance of literature on teams literature from industrial and organizational psychology to engineering education and to identify implications for practice and future directions for research. Scope/Method: Phase 1 systematically reviewed 104 articles published from 2007 to 2012 describing engineering and computer science student team projects and sought to answer the following questions: What professional learning outcomes have been met by team projects? What negative student team behaviors have faculty sought to minimize? What literature has been used to inform development of teamwork outcomes? Phase 2 reviewed five team effectiveness constructs selected according to the results of Phase 1: social loafing, interdependence, conflict, trust, and shared mental models. Examples from Phase 1 articles and our own work explain how this research informs facilitation and assessment of engineering student teams. Conclusions: Engineering faculty sought to achieve a variety of outcomes through team projects, including teamwork, communication, sustainability, and consideration of global/societal design context. They sought to avoid social loafing and conflict while building trust to ensure equal team effort. That few Phase 1 articles engaged the literature about team effectiveness indicates there is great opportunity to apply industrial and organizational psychology research to engineering education. © 2013 ASEE.","Psychology; Systematic review; Team","Engineering and computer science; Engineering faculty; Engineering student projects; Organizational psychology; Professional learning; Psychology; Systematic Review; Team; Engineering education; Industrial research; Industry; Management; Students; Engineering research","(2012) Accreditation policy and procedure manual (2012-2013), , ABET.

Previous research at the secondary level has found engineering design to be a supportive context for science learning. Designing functional artifacts may ground children's exploration of scientific concepts; engineering design may contextualize science learning. Purpose: Our research investigated whether an engineering design-based curriculum changed elementary student science attitudes and science content knowledge in four domains. Design/Method: In the first year of the efficacy study, 12 elementary teachers taught science with their school or district's status quo curriculum. In the second year, they taught the same science content with a new engineering design-based curriculum that incorporated LEGO™ design challenges. In both years, students completed pre- and post-tests on science content and attitudinal surveys. Results: The increase in science content performance from pre- to post-test was significantly greater for the LEGO engineering students than for the status quo students, but there was minimal difference in the science attitudes of the two student groups. Conclusions: The findings suggest that engineering design-based science curriculum units may support elementary students' science content knowledge, while helping students learn to design, construct, and test solutions to engineering problems. Because students using either curriculum had similarly positive attitudes toward science, our research suggests that the benefit of engineering design for science learning cannot be attributed simply to the positive science attitudes that may result from the use of novel materials or methods. © 2013 ASEE.","Elementary engineering design; Science attitudes; Science content knowledge","Content knowledge; Design-based science; Elementary education; Engineering design; Engineering instructions; Engineering problems; Science attitudes; Science instructions; Curricula; Design; Research; Standards; Students; Engineering education","(2013), http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards/, Achieve, Inc.

Yet fields that have traditionally employed these methods do not offer a consensus about research quality. Purpose: This article presents reflections on challenges to research quality in an example interpretive engineering education study, and offers a quality framework that emerged from this study as a coherent, discipline-specific view on interpretive research quality. Design/Method: Analysis of the prior study of engineering students' competency formation by the author(s) is combined with a synthesis of the literature from the broad intellectual traditions of the interpretive paradigm to inform the development of a theoretical framework of research quality. Results: Drawing on the engineering metaphor of quality management, we propose a systematic, process-oriented framework of research quality along two dimensions: a process model locates quality strategies throughout the research process, and a typology systemizes fundamental aspects of validation (theoretical, procedural, communicative, and pragmatic) and the concept of process reliability to explicate quality strategies in their fundamental contribution to substantiating knowledge claims. Conclusion: The quality framework provides a way to develop and demonstrate overall research quality in the interpretive inquiry by shifting attention away from assessing the research quality of a final product. Rather, the framework provides guidance to systematically document and explicitly demonstrate quality considerations throughout the entire research process. © 2013 ASEE.","Interpretive methods; Research quality; Validity","Engineering education research; Interpretive methods; Interpretive research; Process reliability; Quality strategy; Research quality; Theoretical framework; Validity; Engineering education; Quality management; Research","Anfara, V.A., Brown, K.M., Mangione, T.L., Qualitative analysis on stage: Making the research process more public (2002) Educational Researcher, 31 (7), pp. 28-38. , doi: 10.3102/0013189x031007028; Apel, K.O., The a priori of communication and the foundation of the humanities (1972) Man and World, 5 (1), pp. 3-37; Argyris, C., Schoen, D.A., (1974) Theory in practice: Increasing professional effectiveness, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Ashworth, P., Bracketing in phenomenology: Renouncing assumptions in hearing about student cheating (1999) International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 12 (6), pp. 707-721; Baillie, C., Ko, E., Newstetter, W., Radcliffe, D.F., Advancing diverse and inclusive engineering education practices through interdisciplinary research and scholarship (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 6-13; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The social construction of reality: A treatise in the sociology of knowledge, , New York, NY: Doubleday; Borrego, M., Conceptual difficulties experienced by trained engineers learning educational research methods (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (2), pp. 91-102; Borrego, M., Development of engineering education as a rigorous discipline: A study of the publication patterns of four coalitions (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (1), pp. 5-18; Borrego, M., Bernhard, J., The emergence of engineering education research as an internationally connected field of inquiry (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 14-47; Borrego, M., Douglas, E.P., Amelink, C.T., Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods in engineering education (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (1), pp. 53-66; Borrego, M., Newswander, L.K., Definitions of interdisciplinary research: Toward graduate-level interdisciplinary learning outcomes (2010) Review of Higher Education, 34 (1), pp. 61-84; Boyatzis, R.E., (1982) The competent manager: A model for effective performance, , New York, NY: Wiley; Brinberg, D., McGrath, J.E., (1985) Validity and the research process, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Buehler-Niederberger, D., Analytische Induktion als Verfahren qualitativer Methodologie (1985) Zeitschrift für Soziologie, 14, pp. 475-485; Case, J.M., Light, G., Emerging research methodologies in engineering education research (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 186-210; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Cho, J., Trent, A., Validity in qualitative research revisited (2006) Qualitative Research, 6 (3), pp. 319-340. , doi: 10.1177/1468794106065006; Cilliers, P., (1998) Complexity and postmodernism: Understanding complex systems, , New York, NY: Routledge; Clandinin, D.J., Connelly, F.M., (1989), http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED309681, Narrative and story in practice and research.

The aim of Medialogy is to facilitate creativity within technical solutions. The intention of this paper is to answer the following: how do the Medialogy teachers perceive creativity and how do they facilitate it? Many of the answers point to the pedagogical approach used in problem-based learning, which are perceived as an important element for the creative process. In this paper we will also argue the importance of including the social context (both at a macro and at a micro level) in the definition and use of creativity in engineering education. © 2013 SEFI.","creativity; engineering education; problem-based learning; project work","Aalborg University; Creative process; creativity; Cross-disciplinary; Pedagogical approach; Problem based learning; Project work; Technical solutions; Engineering education; Teaching","Amabile, T., (1983) The Social Psychology of Creativity, , New York, New York,: Springer-Verlag; Amabile, T., How to Kill Creativity (2006) Harvard Business Review, 76 (5), pp. 77-87; Baillie, C., Enhancing Creativity in Engineering Students (2002) Engineering Science and Education Journal, 11 (5), pp. 185-192; Balke, E., Play and the Arts: The Importance of the Unimportant (1997) Childhood Education, 73 (6), pp. 353-360; Barak, M., Problem-Solving in Technological Context: The Role of Strategies, Schemes and Heuristics (2007) Design and Technology for the Next Generation, pp. 154-169. , In: Barlex D., editors Whitchruch, Whitchruch,: Cliffeco Communication; Barge, S., (2010) Principles of Problem and Project Based Learning.

The main innovation is the use of a system for evaluating the groups of students selected for the application of this methodology. This evaluation complements the one obtained from the project report developed by students, and it allows for individualizing the grade outcome of the members of the groups. For this purpose, the system takes into account the evaluations carried out by students of their own experience of teamwork. The system has been tested with several groups of students of surveying engineering. The results have demonstrated the efficiency of the system in showing and detecting the behavior of the groups, some problems appearing during the work, the involvement of students, and the sharing of tasks performed by some groups, among other issues. This experience can be applied to any other subject of engineering that contains a high level of practice work. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Evaluation; Groups; Project-based learning; Surveying engineering","Evaluation; Groups; Project based learning; Project reports; Students; Surveys; Engineering education","Chinowsky, P.S., Brown, H., Szajnman, A., Realph, A., Developing knowledge landscapes through project-based learning (2006) J.

Students are expected to learn the underlying theories through manipulating the equipment, observing the phenomena of fluid mechanics, and analyzing the data recorded in the laboratory. However, the procedures are usually complicated and require large amounts of preparation to ensure the success of the experiment. In this research, current paper-based preparations are improved by providing virtual equipment that can provide instant and realistic feedback, with the ability to deliver these over the Internet. This research selected the Venturi tube experiment as a case study. Five steps were defined in the development process: (1) defining the experiment procedure, (2) building a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality model, (3) adding procedure controllers, (4) adding physics rules to the virtual world, and (5) adding 3D manipulation functions. The virtual experiment of Venturi tube was implemented and evaluated in a real class, with the involvement of 48 undergraduate students in National Taiwan University. The students were separated randomly into two groups, one using paper-based preparation and the other using the virtual equipment for experiment preparation. The results showed that the students who prepared using the virtual equipment performed significantly better in both speed and skill application in the real experiment. Their attitudes toward learning were also significantly more positive than that of the other group. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Engineering education; Hydraulic experiment; Virtual equipment; Virtual reality","Development process; Experiment Courses; National Taiwan University; Standard procedures; Undergraduate students; Virtual equipments; Virtual experiments; Virtual reality modeling; Controllers; Engineering education; Equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulics; Nozzles; Students; Three dimensional; Virtual reality; Experiments","Al-Khalifah, A., McCrindle, R., Alexandrov, V., (2006) Immersive Open Surgery Simulation, pp. 868-871. , Proc. 6th Int.

However, it is perceived by local industrial and academic sectors that changes in the curriculum are not dynamic enough to keep pace with a rapidly-changing marketplace. The objective of this study is to shed some light on these perceptions. This paper reports results of a study carried out in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of ranking generic competencies required from engineering graduates. A questionnaire was designed and sent to engineers working in industry or in academia. The questionnaire included fifty competencies that were grouped into four domains: knowledge and understanding, personal and professional skills, interpersonal skills, and practicing skills. The analysis of the survey data has identified the competencies that are valued by industry and academia. The overall analysis showed that non-technical and attitudinal competencies are being perceived as equally important as technical ones. This is consistent with studies carried out elsewhere in the world. However, some issues such as communication in English language and computer literacy are deemed equally important. The findings of this study may be helpful in identifying the critical soft skills that need to be carefully addressed in any tuning of the current engineering curriculum. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering competencies; Ranking; Soft skills; Surveys","Engineering colleges; Engineering Competencies; Engineering curriculum; Engineering graduates; Interpersonal skills; Professional skills; Ranking; Soft skills; Computer science; Curricula; Engineering; Industry; Personnel training; Surveying; Surveys; Engineering education","Becker, F.S., Globalization, curricula reform and the consequences for engineers working in an international company (2006) European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (3), pp. 261-272; Markes, I., Areview of literature on employability skills needs in engineering (2006) European Journal for Engineering Education, 31 (6), pp. 637-650; Litecky, C.R., Arnett, K.P., Prabhakar, B., The Paradox of soft skills versus technical Skills in is hiring (2004) The Journal of Computer Information Systems, 45 (1), pp. 69-77; Arlett, C., Lamb, F., Dales, R., Willis, L., Hurdle, E., Meeting the needs of industry: The drivers for change in engineering education (2010) Engineering Education, 5 (2), pp. 18-25; Ashman, P.J., Scrutton, S., Stringer, D., Mullinger, P.J., Willison, J., Stakeholder perceptions of chemical engineering graduate attributes at the university of Adelaide (2008) Proceedings of the CHEMECA Conference on Towards A Sustainable Australasia, , Newcastle City Hall, New South Wales, Sept. 28-Oct. 1; Passow, H.J., Which ABET competencies do engineering graduates find most important in their work?

This ethnographic study, part of a three-year longitudinal research project, investigated Year 8 female students' learning about engineering concepts associated with designing, constructing, testing, and evaluating a catapult. There was a series of lead-up lessons and four lessons for the catapult challenge (total of 18 x 45- minute lessons) over a nine-week period. Data from two girls within a focus group showed that they needed to: (1) receive clarification on engineering terms to facilitate more fluent discourse, (2) question and debate conceptual understandings without peers being judgmental, and (3) have multiple opportunities for engaging with materials towards designing, constructing and explaining key concepts learnt. There are implications for teachers facilitating STEMeducation, such as: clarifying STEM terms, articulating how students can interact in non-judgmental ways, and providing multiple opportunities for interacting within engineering education. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Girls' education; Middle schooling; Science and mathematics","Conceptual understanding; Engineering concepts; Engineering project; Ethnographic study; Female students; Longitudinal research; Middle schooling; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Engineering education; Research; Students","Bee, D.J., Puck, B.S., Heimdahl, P.D., Summertechnology & engineering preview at stout (steps) for girls (2003) The 2003 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition, , Paper presented at Salt Lake City, UT, June; Hubelbank, J., Demetry, C., Nicholson, S.E., Blaisdell, S., Quinn, P., Rosenthal, E.S., Long term effects of a middle school engineering outreach program for girls: A controlled study (2007) ASEE Annual Conference, , Washington, D.C; http://www.engineergirl.org/, Homepage Accessed 31 January 2013; Watford, B., Didion, C., Paddock, P., Jenniches, S., Gildea, A., Gramlins, K., (2008) Engineergirl: A Website to Introduce Middle School Girls to Engineering, , http://www.engineergirl.org/; Little, A.J., Barra De La León, B.A., Attracting girls to science, engineering and technology: An Australian perspective (2009) European Journal of Engineering Education, 34 (5), pp. 439-445; Cantrell, P., Ewing-Taylor, J., Exploring STEM career options through collaborative high school seminars (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (3), pp. 295-303; Ramowski, S., Nystorm, R., (2007) The Changing Adolescent Brain, , www.nwpublichealth.org/archives/s2007adolescent:brain; Wormelli, R., (2003) Day One & Beyond: Practical Matters for New Middle-level Teacher, , Stenhouse Publications, Portland, ME; Nagel, M., The middle years learner's brain (2005) Teaching Middle Years: Rethinking Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment, pp. 65-76. , D.

In early educational studios, particular attention needs to be paid to the limited design experience that students may have already acquired, together with the amount of information they need to process within strict academic timeframes. This should also develop within an appropriate understanding and carrying-out of design as an integral, systematic and logical process. Thus, the present study primarily aims at developing a process-based approach to teaching 'architectural design I' that responds to the aforementioned challenges. The proposed model is described in two phases. The first phase comprises six steps that are planned as a medium for gradual and cumulative learning about the principles of architectural design. The second phase comes in four steps. It aims at introducing students to a systematic design process that they can pursue in their future academic and practical endeavours. The proposed model should help students to grasp the basic interdependent design principles, apply them within a systematic logical process, and gain independence in future design studies and professional development. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Architectural design;

It is tested against other methods which also take partial knowledge into account, namely, elimination testing for multiple-choice tests, as well as the conventional dichotomous method of scoring. The scheme is thought of as novel, in that it considers partial knowledge and omissions using a developed method based on probability theory. The results obtained were found to be quite similar to the 'more-complicated-to-use' elimination testing and lower results were found when compared with the conventional dichotomous method. Although the work here was undertaken to enhance testing within engineering education, there is no reason why this approach cannot be applied to any number of areas within science and arts subjects. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Computer-aided assessment; Multiple-choice assessment; Scoring","Computer-aided assessment; Multiple-choice assessment; Partial knowledge; Probability theory; Scoring; Scoring methods; Education; Engineering education; Probability","Bretts, L.R., Elder, T.J., Hartley, J., Trueman, M., Does correction for guessing reduce students' performance on multiple-choice examinations?

However, no general concept for selecting the most appropriate devices for each structure is available, therefore understanding the dynamic processes is important for the selection and design of proper energy dissipation system to improve bridges' dynamic behavior. This study is focused on an active training method for studying the behavior of bridges with base isolation systems under earthquakes. The proposed method includes creating and testing of bridges' numerical models in the classroom, and further results' analysis by the students, aimed at drawing practical conclusions under the teacher's supervision. To implement the method in the learning process, a Bridge Dynamics Laboratory was created in the Simulink environment. Original libraries of bridge's structural elements, anti-seismic devices and seismic loads were developed. Modeling bridges using these libraries is a simple procedure, being easily incorporated in the learning process during class teaching. Simulink allows the development of bridge models that visually reflect the real physical processes, involving the bridge structure, and provides the possibility of quick and convenient modification of any parameter characterizing the model. The learning process includes the representation and measurement of structural behavioral parameters, and their dependence on types and technical characteristics of the applied seismic protection system. Dynamic processes are studied based on modern standards. Time-history analysis is used to simulate the investigated bridge behavior under a selected earthquake. Implementation of the proposed method in the classroom teaching process of an undergraduate course is presented and explained. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Base isolation; Bridges; Engineering education; Seismic response; Simulink; Virtual laboratory","Base isolation; Base isolation systems; Base-isolated bridges; Behavioral parameters; Energy dissipation system; Parameter characterizing; Simulink; Virtual laboratories; Dynamic response; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; Engineering education; Learning systems; Libraries; Seismic response; Structural design; Teaching; Bridges","Castellano, M.G., Infanti, S., Colato, G.P., The experience of FIP Industriale in retrofit of bridges through seismic isolation and energy dissipation (2009) Buletinul AGIR, 2, pp. 266-278; (2012) MAURER Seismic Protection, , http://www.maurer-soehne.com/files/bauwerkschutzsysteme/pdf/en/brochure/ MAURER_Seismic_Protection.pdf, Maurer-Sohne, accessed 1 October; Dyke, S.J., Johnson, S.M., Ranf, R.T., Caicedo, J.M., Soto-Fournier, M., Advancing earthquake engineering education through a cooperative effort based on instructional shake tables (2002) Proceedings of 7th US National Conference on Earthquake Engineering EERI, , https://engineering.purdue.edu/UCIST/publications/publications.htm, Boston, MA, July 21-25, Accessed 1 October 2012; Blostotsky, B., Efraim, E., Ribakov, Y., Using a small-scale shake table for teaching typical problems of structural dynamics (2009) International Journal of Engineering Education, 25, pp. 53-64; Kuester, F., Hutchinson, T.C., A virtualized laboratory for earthquake engineering education (2007) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 15, pp. 15-29. , DOI: 10.1002/cae.2009.1; Gao, Y., Yang, G., Spencer Jr., B.F., Lee, G.C., Javapowered virtual laboratories for earthquake engineering education (2005) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 13, p. 200212; Kiusalaas, J., (2005) Numerical Methods in Engineering with MATLAB, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Davidovitch, N., Ribakov, Y., Teaching engineering subjects using MATLAB (2010) Problems of Education in the 21st Century, 19 (19), pp. 9-14; Katsanos, E.I., Taskari, O.N., Sextos, A.G., A Matlabbased educational tool for the seismic design of flexibly supported RC buildings (2011) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, , Published online in Wiley Online Library; DOI: 10.1002/cae.20568; Huang, D., Xia, H., Liu, Y., Wu, B., Simulation of structural nonlinear seismic responses based on Simulink (2004) Proceeding of 13th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, , Vancouver, Canada, Paper No.1530; Dolce, M., Cardone, D., Palermo, G., Seismic isolation of bridges using isolation systems based on flat sliding bearings (2007) Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering, 5, pp. 491-509. , DOI: 10.1007/s10518-007-9044-3; Eurocode 8: Design of Structures for Earthquake Resistance-Part 2: Bridges, , European Standard EN 1998-2:2005; Anti-seismic Devices, , European Standard EN 15129: 2009; Eurocode 8: Design of Structures for Earthquake Resistance-Part 1: General Rules, Seismic Actions and Rules for Buildings, , European standard EN 1998-1:2004; (2012) AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, , American Association of State and Highway Transportation Officials, Customary U.S. Units, 6th edn; Marioni, A., (2012) Innovative Antiseismic Devices Developed by ALGA, , http://www.alga.it/uploads/357_2008- Innovative_antiseismic_devices_developed_by_ALGA.pdf, Accessed 1 October; Martelli, A., Recent progress of application of modern antiseismic systems in Europe-Part 1: Seismic isolation (2008) Proceedings of the 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, , http://www.14wcee.org/Proceedings/files/S05-01-010.pdf, Beijing, China, October 12-17, Paper ID: S05- 01-010, Accessed 1 October 2012; Martelli, A., Recent progress of application of modern antiseismic systems in Europe-Part 2: Energy dissipation systems, shape memory alloy devices and shock transmitters (2008) Proceedings of the 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, , Beijing, China, October 12-17, Paper ID: S05-02-018; Sarrazin, M., Moroni, M.O., Soto, P., Boroschek, R., Tomaselli, F., Applications on seismic isolation and energy dissipation in bridges in Chile and Venezuela (2001) Proc. 7th International Seminar on Seismic Isolation, Passive Energy Dissipation and Active Control of Vibrations of Structures, , Assisi, Italy, October 2-5; Baldo, P., Tomaselli, F., Pimenta, F., Loureiro viaduct seismic protection: Testing of non-linear viscous dampers (2004) Proceedings of 6th National Congress of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering (SISMICA 2004), pp. 679-690. , Guimaraes, Portugal, April 14-16; Infanti, S., Papanikolas, P., Benzoni, G., Castellano, M.G., Rion-Antirion bridge.

It was assessed in terms of students' perceptions of the simulation-based environment and attitudes toward robotics lessons using simulation. This study employed a quantitative method via two questionnaires: the six scales of Constructivist Simulation-based Learning Environment Survey (CSLES) and the one scale of Test of Robotics Related Attitudes (TORRA). The sample consisted of 114 undergraduate and fresh graduate students (age 22 to 25) who had attended a formal course of automation and robotics. They were randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental group (n = 60) and control group (n = 54). The experimental group used a game-based robotics simulator (G-IRSTS) and the control group used a conventional robot simulator (IRSTS). Using statistical methods, both CSLES and TORRA were found to exhibit good factor and reliability validity. The main finding of this study indicates that G-IRSTS is more effective than IRSTS in terms of Negotiation, Inquiry learning, Reflective Thinking and Challenge. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Constructivist learning; Game-based learning; Robot simulation; Student perceptions","Constructivist learning; Game-based Learning; Learning environments; Quantitative method; Reflective thinking; Robot simulations; Simulation-based learning; Student perceptions; Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Simulators; Students; Surveys; Robotics","Coller, B.D., Scott, M.J., Effectiveness of using a video game to teach a course in mechanical engineering (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (3), pp. 900-912; Clark, D.B., Nelson, B.C., Chang, H.Y., Martinez-Garza, M., Slack, K., D'angelo, C.M., Exploring Newtonian mechanics in a conceptually-integrated digital game: Comparison of learning and affective outcomes for students in Taiwan and the United States Computers&Education, 57 (3), pp. 2178-2195; Pourabdollahian, B., Taisch, M., Kerga, E., Serious games in manufacturing education: Evaluation of learners' engagement (2012) Procedia Computer Science, 15, pp. 256-265; Kosmadoudi, Z., Lim, T., Ritchie, J., Louchart, S., Liu, Y., Sung, R., Engineering design using game-enhanced CAD: The potential to augment the user experience with game elements (2013) Computer-Aided Design, 45 (3), pp. 777-795; Ebner, M., Holzinger, A., Successful implementation of user-centered game based learning in higher education: An example from civil engineering Computers & Education, 49 (3), pp. 873-890; Wall, J., Ahmed, V., Use of a simulation game in delivering blended lifelong learning in the construction industry- Opportunities and Challenges Computers & Education, 50 (4), pp. 1383-1393; Hainey, T., Connolly, T.M., Stansfield, M., Boyle, E.A., Evaluation of a game to teach requirements collection and analysis in software engineering at tertiary education level (2011) Computers & Education, 56 (1), pp. 21-35; Chen, W.F., Wu, W.H., Chuang, T.Y., Chou, P.N., The effect of varied game-based learning systems in engineering education: An experimental study (2011) International Journal of Engineering Education, 27 (3); Minović, M., Milovanović, M., Kovačević, I., Minović, J., Starčević, D., Game design as a learning tool for the course of computer networks (2011) International Journal of Engineering Education, 27 (3); Kazimoglu, C., Kiernan, M., Bacon, L., Mackinnon, L., A serious game for developing computational thinking and learning introductory computer programming (2012) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 47, pp. 1991-1999; Hwang, G.J., Wu, P.H., Chen, C.C., An online game approach for improving students' learning performance in web-based problem-solving activities (2012) Computers & Education, 59 (4), pp. 1246-1256; Sung, H.Y., Hwang, G.J., A collaborative game-based learning approach to improving students' learning performance in science courses (2013) Computers & Education, 63, pp. 43-51; Schrader, C., Bastiaens, T.J., The influence of virtual presence: Effects on experienced cognitive load and learning outcomes in educational computer games (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28 (2), pp. 648-658; Cheng, C.H., Su, C.H., Agame-based learning system for improving student's learning effectiveness in system analysis course (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31, pp. 669-675; Guillén-Nieto, V., Aleson-Carbonell, M., Serious games and learning effectiveness: The case of it's a Deal!

To improve retention rates in engineering programs, the reasons why students leave engineering must be determined. In this paper, we review the literature on attrition from engineering programs to identify the breadth of factors that contribute to students' decisions to leave. Fifty studies on student attrition from engineering programs were included in the primary part of this literature review. In the second half of the work, an additional twenty-five studies that focused on methods of increasing student retention, were examined. Six broad factors driving students to leave engineering were identified by examining the attrition literature: classroom and academic climate, grades and conceptual understanding, self-efficacy and self-confidence, high school preparation, interest and career goals, and race and gender. Evidence from the retention studies suggests that successful efforts to increase retention act on one or more of these factors.Aclear gap in the literature is that of economics: the costs associated with losing students, and the costs associated with implementing retention strategies, are virtually unmentioned. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Attrition; Engineering education; Retention; STEM education","Attrition; Conceptual understanding; Engineering program; Literature reviews; Retention; Retention strategies; STEM education; Student retention; Economics; Engineering; Engineering education; Students","Steinberg, S.S., The relations of secondary mathematics to engineering education (1949) Mathematics Teacher, 42 (8); Seymour, E., Hewitt, N., (1997) Talking about Leaving, , Westview Press, Boulder, CO; Amadei, B., (2011) Engineering for the Developing World, National Academy of Engineering, , http://engineeringchallenges.org; Ottery, C., (2010) Lack of Engineers Stifling Development, Says Report, Science and Development Network, , http://www.scidev.net; Adelman, C., (1998) Women and Men of the Engineering Path: A Model for the Analysis of Undergraduate Careers, , U.S. Department of Education, Washington, DC; Augustine, R.D., (1966) Persistence and Attrition of Engineering Students: A Study of Freshman and Sophomore Engineering Students at Three Midwestern Universities, , U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Office of Education; Besterfield-Sacre, M., Atman, C.J., Shuman, L.J., Characteristics of freshman engineering students: Models for determining student attrition in engineering (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (2), pp. 139-149; Brainard, S.G., Carlin, L., Asix-year longitudinal study of undergraduate women in engineering and science (1998) Journal of Engineering Education, 87 (4), pp. 369-375; Huang, G., Taddese, N., Walter, E., Peng, S.S., Entry and persistence of women and minorities in college science and engineering education (2000) National Center for Education Statistics, , U.S. Department of Education Office of Educational Research and Improvement; Kokkelenberg, E.C., Sinha, E., Who succeeds in STEM studies?

The main difficulty was knowing how to act with current materials and technologies. Because of the prohibitive costs of modern devices, it would be necessary to build a partnership with an industrial leader. Starting in January 2009, we made an appointment with Aastra France. Aastra is a major company acting especially in unified communications. Aastra is a leading company at the forefront of the enterprise communication market around the world. Aastra develops and delivers innovative communication products and applications for businesses. The choice of Aastra takes its origin in the 2005 Matra/EADS takeover. Matra/EADS was a french leader in digital telephony solutions and a long time ago, I was acting as an IT manager in a local administration, using Matra products.

The first benefit would be the access to educational resources, independent of location and time. With the wide spread of mobile technologies, from mobile phones and tablets that support content distribution, social media communication and collaboration, to teaching methods and technologies, teaching and learning must be adapted to these new challenges in online higher education. Therefore, courses must be redesigned and structured in order to be accessible to individual study. The paper is focused on developing a template for online courses, starting from designing the main learning objects as resources and activities, including teaching materials, online assessments, questionnaires and communication-interaction tools such as webinars, forums and chat. As a good practice example, we present the results from the application of a course evaluation questionnaire, in terms of structure, content, interaction between participants. Based on these results a comparative analysis is made between online and blended learning, regarding the fact that there are a lot of constraints that affect the way blended courses are developed, which can compromise their quality. In conclusion, we present the main benefits of using this method of learning. As future work, we make some remarks about improvements regarding the system and methods. © 2013 IEEE.","blended learning; course template; e-learning","Blended learning; Comparative analysis; Content distribution; course template; Educational resource; Implementation models; On-line assessment; Teaching and learning; Communication; Curricula; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Quality control; Surveys; Teaching; Virtual reality; E-learning","Lewis, D., Chen, E., Factors Leading to a Quality E-Learning Experience (2010) Online Education and Adult Learning: New Frontiers for Teaching Practice, , T.

Within the frame of the academic-industry cooperation, the intelligent adaptive controller was tested at the Department of Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence, Technical university of Kosice, Slovakia. The tests of the mobile intelligent adaptive controller were performed on two levels of university study, on the Bachelor level on the exercises from the subject ""Control of Technological Processes"" and on the Engineering level the exercises from the subject ""Intelligent Control Networks"" and on one Diploma project. Goals of students of the Control of the technological processes course had two goals, firstly to connect the intelligent adaptive controller to pre-defined controlled system (real plant, real model or simulated model) and next to validate the control results. Students of the Diploma project on the Engineering level had more advanced goals. Tasks defined for engineering students were to connect the intelligent adaptive controller to non-defined controlled system, setup the adaptivity process of the controller regarding the learning error, parameterize the control system, observe and validate the control results. Both sides concluded this cooperation as very valuable. Main contributions for students were (U1) the challenge to apply studied theoretical knowledge on the real industrial controllers, (U2) experience with new research results and technologies deployed in industry and (U3) the implementation of the control and adaptive algorithms from abstract mathematical area to real PLC controller. On side of industry research company the main contributions were (C1) testing of designed algorithms and (C2) user feedback from students to make the application HMI interface more understandable a native. © 2013 IEEE.","cooperation; education; industry research; university","Academic-industry cooperations; cooperation; Experimental development; Industrial controllers; Industry research; Technical universities; Technological process; university; Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive control systems; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Controllers; Education; Education computing; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Engineering education; Industrial research; Industry; Students; Process control","Complex Company Literature of the Kybernetes, , s.r.o. company; Krokavec, D., Filasova, A., Optimal Stochatic Systems, , ISBN 80-89066-52-6; Sinčák, P., Andrejková, G., (2013) Neural Networks - Neurónové Siete Inžiniersky Prístup (1.

Since the students will be exposed to this situation immediately after graduation when they start their jobs it is desirable to involve them in research projects. Through this work they acquire new knowledge and skills they will need in the future jobs. Moreover, they are frequently participating in strongly interdisciplinary research that requires orientation not only in engineering disciplines, but also in the other concerned areas. One of the typical examples is the area of Biomedical Engineering.

We have designed the main lines of the process to guide employees from Orange-France Telecom over a full year, from an information session to a validation jury for their diploma. In the meantime, they participate in collective courses helping them to write a professional overview activity report, describing their acquired expertise during their professional life in line with the targeted diploma. Each participant is also individually tutored by a university professor. The jury outcome is then of three kinds: the diploma is delivered, or not, or only some units are granted. In this latter case, advice is given to achieve a full completion of the curricula.

At the same time, globalization and the need for streamlining time facilitate the development of new methods of imparting knowledge. With the new information technologies, new forms of learning occur adding greater dynamism to the information. This form of learning, which optimizes time and space, is known as distance learning and it is being amply used in many different areas. Distance education presents the advantage of facilitating the teaching and learning processes without face-to-face interaction as knowledge is transmitted, partly or as a whole using technology. In fact, technological innovation has assumed a vital role in education. Looking to achieve more efficiency in carrying out the various activities, the job market constantly requires an investment in new skills and knowledge so that the professionals can operate the equipment and working tools, successfully and with quality. This paper presents a new system of learning a curricular unit of Circuit Theory using desktop virtual reality (VR). The software provides the possibility to understand the relationship between the physical concepts of an electrical circuit, direct or alternating current, through computer simulations and animations. This work was developed to demonstrate how a desktop VR prototype, ""Virtual Electric Manual""-VEMA, can be applied to an engineering unit and used to enhance security and resourcefulness in using electrical equipment. Several interactive scenes were developed to illustrate the idea using a measurements and instrumentation laboratory as virtual environment. A range of interactive learning environments are presented: the menu with the first interactive experiment is the simulator of a DC circuit. It allows the student to analyze the setting up of a parallel, or series-parallel resistive circuit series powered by direct current; the second menu, features the simulator of an alternating current circuit and demonstrates how the student can perform the analysis of a circuit with resistors, inductors and capacitors; the third interactive experiment is the simulator of a three-phase alternating current circuit; the fourth menu refers to a study on the transitional phenomena. Finally, the fifth menu is an interactive experiment related to the phenomena of resonance. VEMA offers students the opportunity to understand the processes, helping them to better discern the procedures and trains them to interact with the equipment. The VEMA prototype addresses these issues and highlights the potential benefits of using VR for this purpose. Each experiment will provide technical and scientific knowledge in order to give the student/user adequate information and training in the subject. © 2013 IEEE.","circuit theory; electrical circuits; interactive circuit; learning object","Desktop virtual reality; Electrical circuit; Face-to-face interaction; Instrumentation laboratories; Interactive circuits; Interactive learning environment; Learning objects; Technological innovation; Circuit theory; Computer aided instruction; Distance education; Electric network analysis; Equipment; Experiments; Information technology; Networks (circuits); Personnel training; Simulators; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Engineering education","Dos Santos, S.C., O processo de ensino-aprendizagem e a relação professor-aluno: Aplicação dos ""sete princípios para a boa prática na educação de ensino superior"" (2001) Caderno de Pesquisas Em Administração, 8 (1), pp. 69-82. , in Portuguese; Touriñán, J.M., Guimaraes, A., Educaçao eletrónica.

This role is emphasized through the legal obligation to welcome and support these students in French universities. We need to open our courses to more students with disabilities. To do that, reception and support services are available in our universities and work has begun which aims to improve the accessibility of facilities for disabled people. The teaching and workstations in practical labs must also be adapted to make them accessible to students with disabilities. Experiences locally exist but sharing this knowledge and these projects is needed. Work is already underway in this direction but a census of training courses ""accessible"" is also necessary. This article discusses the considerations needed for this census. It first defines the criteria of course accessibility. Then, local and national accessibility experiences are presented. Finally, an European project to improve the legibility of EIE cursus accessible for disabled students is describe. © 2013 IEEE.","accessible courses; European mobility; learning improvement; sharing of experiences; Students with disabilities","accessible courses; Disabled students; European project; learning improvement; Legal obligations; People with disabilities; sharing of experiences; Training institutions; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Students; Surveys; Handicapped persons","http://www.cpu.fr/Handicap.275.0.html; http://www.cpu.fr/uploads/tx_publications/ 120417_CP_charte_handicap_2012_.pdf; http://www.handi-u.fr/; http://www.freedomscientific.com/jaws-hq.asp; http://www.clarosoftware.com/; http://www.u-bordeaux1.fr/vie-etudiante/profilsspecifiques/ sportifs-de-haut-niveau-etudiants-handicapes-artistesconfirmes.html; Demontoux, F., Woirgard, E., Belliard, E., Verdeau, K., Bernou, C., L'Enseignement de l'Electronique Accessible aux étudiants Handicapés (2009) J3EA, 8; Demontoux, F., Dicky, A., Eydon, F., Verdeau, K., Woirgard, E., La télé participation aux enseignements.

A general worldwide trend is the development of distance learning sites and virtual laboratories, which are providing state-of-the-art education in all possible areas and are coexisting with the available on-site and in-person courses and subjects. In the Internet-oriented 21st century many university students have turned to and prefer these electronic and virtual educational resources, not only as additional learning options, but also as primary means for obtaining the latest educational materials by the leading university lecturers worldwide. This process has presented one of the major challenges for the available virtual learning environments - how to make it possible for the students to access, use and work with real equipment. In this paper we present our vision for a virtual laboratory which will provide the possibility for the students to access remotely and in real time the available laboratory set of telecommunication devices. In the Introduction section of the paper we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the available virtual learning environments. In the next Section we introduce the general conceptual model of the planned laboratory and later we present the actual structure and the organizational requirements for its implementation. The paper continues with a Section, which presents the created virtual laboratory and its capabilities, and is finalized by the Conclusions and References sections. © 2013 IEEE.","ICT in education; remote access to real devices; virtual laboratory; virtual learning environments","Conceptual model; Educational materials; Educational resource; Remote access; Telecommunication devices; University students; Virtual laboratories; Virtual learning environments; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Laboratories; Students; Teaching; Telecommunication equipment; E-learning","Dillenbourg, P., Virtual learning environments Workshop on Virtual Learning Environments at the EUN Conference ""Learning in the New Millennium: Building New Education Strategies for Schools"", 2000; Zandvliet, D.B., Learning environments in technology-rich classrooms (2002) Studies in Educational Learning Environments: An International Perspective, pp. 49-72. , River Edge, NJ: World Scientific; Courts, B., Tucker, J., Using Technology To Create A Dynamic Classroom Experience (2012) Journal of College Teaching & Learning (TLC), 9 (2), pp. 121-128; Armstrong, H., Murray, I., Remote and Local Delivery of Cisco Education for the Vision-Impaired (2007) ITiCSE 2007, Dundee Scotland, pp. 78-81; Hope, J., Von Konsky, B., Murray, I., Chew, L.C., Farrugia, B., A Cisco Education Tool Accessible to the Vision Impaired (2006) ASSETS06, Portland, Oregon USA, pp. 235-236; Murray, I., Armstrong, H., Innovations in tertiary online learning for students who are blind or vision impaired 7th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, Sydney, Australia, 2006; Bates, A., Poole, G., (2003) Effective Teaching with Technology in Higher Education, , Jossey-Bass/John Wiley, San Francisco, USA; (2008) Recommendation 1836 - Realising the Full Potential of e-learning for Education and Training, , Council of Europe; Johnson, H.M., Dialogue and the construction of knowledge in elearning: Exploring students' perceptions of their learning while using Blackboard's asynchronous discussion board (2007) European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning, , ISSN 10275-207","Department of Telecommunications, Studentska str. 8, Ruse 7017, Bulgaria",,9781479900435,,"English","Proc.

Even if interdisciplinary knowledge is expected, more or less, those projects cover only one course. We are aware, that real life project teams are mostly interdisciplinary, so we are trying to organise the work in similar spirit. In such a case a lot of organisational work and agreements between teachers from different disciplines and courses on preparation of projects (distribution and evaluation of workload that is demand by each discipline or course) is required. More interdisciplinary are projects that are not part of study programs and students are cooperating in them for other reasons and motivations.

In this paper we describe an improved proposal for accreditation of one important subject in engineering, namely Control Systems. The described procedure could be applied in the frame of LLL and also in classical engineering education systems, such as university and college education, in order to harmonize the recognition of engineering degrees in Europe and outside the Europe.

A way to invert this trend consists in educating young generations in microelectronics, microtechnology and nanotechnologies, a specific topic of the electrical and information engineering. The Higher Education in these fields is organized in France through a network (GIP-CNFM) that coordinates the 12 regional interuniversity centres that have facilities as well in technological processes as in design of microelectronics devices and circuits. The main role of the GIP-CNFM is to harmonize and financially support the activities of the 12 centres essentially involved in higher education. But new objectives concern the attractiveness of young high-schoolers by the way of the organization of special sessions of for them as well for their teachers (educators), by the way of a one-day internship of training courses, scheduled on the facilities of the technological platforms. Since 2009, several experiments in this scheme have been setup through the GIP-CNFM network. Thanks to these prioneering experiments, several tens of secondary classes were brought to a better knowledge of microelectronics and nanotechnologies impact on science, technology and daily life. © 2013 IEEE.","Awareness of schoolers; Higher education in EIE; Microelectronics; Nanotechnology; National network; Young people attitudes","Awareness of schoolers; Electrical and information engineerings; Higher education; Interuniversity; Technological platform; Technological process; Training course; Young peoples; Experiments; Microelectronics; Nanotechnology; Networks (circuits); Personnel training; Teaching; Engineering education","Coordination Nationale Pour la Formation en Microélectronique et en Nanotechnologies, , http://www.cnfm.fr, website: (also website of GIP-CNFM); Bonnaud, O., Gentil, P., GIP-CNFM: A potential model for micro and nanoelectronics education Proc.

Therefore, it is important to prepare university students to handle this working approach and to have this mindset. However, these skills are neglected in the curricula of most universities. The aim of the Erasmus Intensive Programme TrabHCI (Technologies to Reduce the Access Barrier in Human Computer Interaction) is to train international computer science and engineering students in team skills and in human computer interaction technologies. As a motivation, technological challenges for disabled people were presented to the students, followed by a series of lectures on novel human computer interaction technologies including gesture, speech and handwriting recognition as well as language understanding.

The idea of this task was to see how we can, thanks to implementation using Programs available from the European Commission, and associates (ERASMUS, CD, ERASMUS-MUNDUS, ATLANTIS, IP) to emphasize and develop mobility and cross-recognition. Another aspect, strongly connected, was to analyze the existing and possible interactions of Higher Education Institutions and Lifelong Learning. The European consortium of ELLEIEC was a good opportunity to conduct a survey on that point in the various countries involved in the program. Two surveys one for the ""bachelor and master"" levels and one for the doctoral studies were carried out. The survey for the doctoral studies was statistically analyzed.

Those tasks have been determined by both statute of the Lublin University of Technology and particular objectives of each of the scientific units that have been operating in the structure of the EIE Department. Among them, there have been discussed such topics as realizing the process of education on Electrical Engineering and Information Engineering courses, keeping curricula up to date accordingly to the newest requirements of the labour market and developing the idea of additional classes for voluntary students, particularly interested in a specific part of the knowledge. Subsequently, the paper presents crucial data connected with conducted scientific research, including information about papers submitted to Organizing Committees of many international conferences by particular authors. Finally, activities in the field of knowledge transfer and academic entrepreneurship also have been described. It has been necessary to describe such form of academic entrepreneurship activity as Business Incubator of Lublin University of Technology. The most interesting tendencies have been presented in graphs and diagrams and then discussed. In conclusion part authors try to designate the way of evolution of the University and indicate fields which will maintain an expansive tendency as well as suggest sectors which will lose their importance from the global University's aims point of view.

It has its roots in the military domain, where it helped to combine multiple technical disciplines into advanced systems. Today, systems engineering principles are applied successfully in many application areas and complex computer-based systems is one of the most common ones. In this paper we describe how a systems engineering course can serve as a backbone for the computer engineering curricula. The main importance lays in the fact that today the students should not only know the components of systems, but also about the nature of the life cycle, the role of requirements analysis and different aspects of requirements, understand different types of specifications, learn how to use specifications throughout the design process, learn about systems testing, maintenance and management, get acquainted with project management principles, version management and quality assurance. In our approach the system engineering course is an introductory course for the entire curricula and the projects stemming from that course will be continuously developed throughout the other courses. The know-how introduced in that course will be gradually enforced with the follow-up courses, although these courses do not focus directly on systems engineering issues. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computer engineering curricula; Computer-based system; Engineering principles; Engineering process; Introductory course; Project management principles; Requirements analysis; Version management; Curricula; Electrical engineering; Management science; Project management; Quality assurance; Specifications; Systems engineering; Technical presentations; Technology transfer; Engineering education","Craig, K., Nagurka, M., Multidisciplinary Engineering Systems 2nd and 3rd Year College-Wide Courses (2010) Transforming Engineering Education: Creating Interdisciplinary Skills for Complex Global Environments, pp. 1-15; (2012) Systems Engineering Handbook: A Guide for System Life Cycle Processes and Activities, , INCOSE. version 3.2.2.

LED offers one of the most versatile, durable, economic and low power consuming solutions in the lighting arena. The innovation project described in this paper was carried out in spring 2010 for a local small size industrial company that designs and manufactures LED lights and lighting systems. The company gave a task to design a new sauna lighting system utilizing modern multi-colour LEDs. The primary goal was to create an innovative way to control LED lighting in a sauna. All final year students participated in that project and they formed four separate design groups that were formally competing against each other. All groups found many new ideas of which they selected some and made a working prototype. The company leaders selected the best prototype as the winner. As a result, the company got a lot of good ideas and is using those in many of their products today. And the students managed to reduce the gap between the studies and real life work. The working together with industry experts, creative designers, leaders and even members of board took along the students to the most challenging problems of the day with a high motivation level. © 2013 IEEE.","Active learning; Design-build; Electronics engineering; Peer evaluation","Active Learning; Design build; Industrial companies; Industry experts; Innovation projects; Lighting applications; Lighting systems; Peer evaluations; Design; Electrical engineering; Electronics engineering; Engineering education; Lighting; Lighting fixtures; Students; Light emitting diodes","Housing, , http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_asuminen_en.html, [www-document] available; Pirkko, V., Finnish Sauna Culture - Not Just a Cliché, , http://www.sauna.fi, [www-document] available; Nakamura, S., Mukai, T., Senoh, M., Candela -Class High-Brightness InGaN/AlGaN Double-Heterostructure Blue-Light-Emitting-Diodes (1994) Appl.

However, almost every electrical professional needs a good understanding of electromagnetism. The aim of this paper is to present the use of animation and simulation to teach electromagnetics (EM) to the students of Electrical Engineering at the University of Vaasa. Since many students have difficulties in understanding mathematical notation used in EM, students are given a tutorial of mathematical notes during the first lecture. Subsequently, some mathematical issues are also reviewed by animations. Implications of EM formulas are visualized by animated material during lectures. Here we give an application example for Lenz law. In addition, students will do a simulation exercise at the end of the course. The goal is to familiarize students with a simulation program which they use then to solve EM problems. They are also required to document and analyse experiments and results. In recent years, students have written often master's theses from topics of real world industrial problems related to electromagnetic fields. The problems are addressed using simulation software. The students consider that the animated lecture material is illustrative and that simulation exercises are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the essential phenomena. The students who have become deeply familiar with the electromagnetic (EM) fields, have so far gained full employment after completing their studies. © 2013 IEEE.","Animation; Electrical engineering education; Electromagnetics; Simulations of electromagnetic fields","Animation and simulations; Application examples; Electrical engineering students; Electromagnetics; Mathematical notations; Simulation exercise; Simulation program; Simulation software; Animation; Computer software; Electrical engineering; Electromagnetic fields; Engineering education; Problem solving; Teaching; Students","Friesel, A., Motivating Students to Study the Basics of Electronic Engineering in the World full of Electronics (2011) Proc. 20th Annu.

The kernel of the project is a 3D vision system which exploits both CPU and GPU capabilities of personal computers to provide real time analysis and further processing. The system currently acquires one 1536 by 3072 pixels image per second. Images are processed and analysed in real-time to extract approximately 150000 particles every hour. A history of each computed parameter is available through a database where all of them are stored. The main challenge was optimization of the code which is now successful and the provided processes are nowadays in use and well running since several months. The main young software-developer researcher of the project was offered the opportunity to make a presentation of his work to a group of computer science (CS) students in the context of an image processing and industrial vision course (Master 2 level). They learned about application design, image processing tools and subtleties, code optimization, state-of-the-art GPUs and their parallel processors. The harmony and efficiency with which knowledge from distinct domains was applied in his work led students to adopt and successfully implement optimization techniques throughout their lab assignment. Compared to previous years, the student's achievements were significantly and positively influenced by the R&D point of view added to the course. It's also worth noting that computing students were particularly interested by the practical optimization concepts introduced during the presentation. Evidently, integrating theory from different courses into a single project presentation eliminates the singular difficulties and highlights the relevant features of each course. Every technical aspect of the R&D project and students achievements is described. © 2013 IEEE.","cogolin; image processing; optimization; pipeline architecture; student's motivation","3-D vision systems; Application design; cogolin; Image processing tools; Optimization techniques; Parallel processor; Pipeline architecture; Real time analysis; Computer vision; Electrical engineering; Energy utilization; Engineering education; Image processing; Mineral industry; Motivation; Optimization; Personal computers; Program processors; Students","Thurley, M., Identifying, Visualizing and comparing regions in irregularly spaced 3D surface data (2005) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 98, pp. 239-270; Thurley, M., Ng, K., Identification and sizing of the entirely visible rocks from a 3D surface data segmentation of laboratory rock piles (2008) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 111, pp. 170-178; Souhail, O., (2006) Quantification Par Analyse D'images de la Granulométrie des Roches Fragmentées: Amélioration de L'extraction Morphologique des Surfaces, Amélioration de la Reconstruction Stéréologique, , Thesis; The OpenCv Library Website.

The introduction of many different approaches for learning, like face to face learning, e-Iearning, distance learning has presented new ways for obtaining knowledge, but has also resulted in destabilization of the general learning processes. This paper identifies the key challenges, which are the result of this rapid and inevitable implementation of the ICT technologies in education, for both the instructors and the learners. An additional investigation on the situations, which present the modern ICT services as being implemented with and without the use of the technological convergence, is also conducted. The Introduction section of the paper presents the global state of the ICT technologies for educational purposes and the four most common and widely available types of virtual learning environments. Then the common goals of ICT in education are defined, followed by the most significant advantages and disadvantages of using ICT for education. In the next Section of the paper the importance and the impact of the ICT convergence on the learning process, on the instructors and on the students are analyzed.

The National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics (NCMEH) at the Australian Maritime College (AMC) has developed an attribute spectrum that addresses the technical and generic requirements of the engineering programmes as a continuum. In order to ascertain the relevance of the AMC graduate attributes, a survey of the industry stakeholders and graduates was conducted with the proficiency level, judged against the Conceive Design Implement Operate (CDIO) criteria. The findings show that industry desires a high level of proficiency across the full range of graduate attributes and in particular seeks strong competency in the so called 'soft skills' such as communication skills and working with information. The graduates they have employed were assessed as operating at an overall standard slightly below that desired, particularly in areas such as: 'Negotiate the business environment' and 'Behave as a professional'. This data has been used as valuable information in the continuous cycle of improvement in AMC engineering courses, aiding the redesign of the course and units to ensure that the appropriate coverage of graduate attributes is achieved. © 2013: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",,"Business environments; Communication skills; Engineering course; Engineering programmes; Industry stakeholders; Maritime engineering; Proficiency level; Undergraduate engineering course; Industry; Professional aspects; Technical presentations; Engineering education","Bath, D., Smith, C., Stein, S., Swann, R., Beyond mapping and embedding graduate attributes: Bringing together quality assurance and action learning to create a validated and living curriculum (2004) Higher Education Research and Development, 23 (3), pp. 313-328; (2011) Stage 1 Competency Standard for Professional Engineer, , Engineers Australia, Melbourne, Australia; Symes, M., Ranmuthugala, D., Chin, C., Carew, A., An Integrated Delivery and Assessment Process to Address the Graduate Attribute Spectrum (2011) US-China Education Review, pp. A7; Shah, M., Nair, C.S., Employer satisfaction of university graduates: Key capabilities in early career graduates Proceedings of the Teaching and Learning Forums Conference, Perth, Western Australia, 2011; (2000) Employer Satisfaction with Graduate Skills, , ACNielsen Research Services, Evaluations and Investigations Programme, Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Canberra, Australia; (2010) Course Rules and Information, Bachelor of Engineering, , http://www.amc.edu.au/be.course.content.rules, Retrieved from; Crawley, E., Malmqvist, J., Ostlund, S., Brodeur, D., (2007) Rethinking Engineering Education - The CDIO Approach, , Springer; Bloom, B., Englehatt, M., Furst, E., Hill, W., Krathwohl, D., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook 1 - Cognitive Domain, , McKay, New York; Barrie, S., A research-based approach to generic graduate attributes policy (2004) Higher Education Research & Development, 23 (3), pp. 261-275; Campbell, A., Developing generic skills and attributes of international students: The (ir) relevance of the Australian university experience (2010) Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, 32 (5), pp. 487-497; Oliver, B., (2011) Assuring Graduate Outcomes, , Sydney: Australian Learning and Teaching Council","Symes, M.; Australian Maritime College, Australia; email: m.symes@amc.edu.au",,9781909024120,,"English","RINA, R.

Eng level. For the past 32 years, the changes and development of the programme is now reflected by the establishment of the Marine Technology Department, post-graduate courses - by research and by coursework and the completion of the building of the Marine Technology Laboratory which cost 30 Million Malaysian Ringgit. The Marine Technology programme which is the only programme of its kind in Malaysia blends the various disciplines of Mechanical Engineering, Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, Transportation and Offshore Engineering. The philosophy taken by UTM is that Mechanical Engineering forms the basis of the Marine Technology programme whilst Naval Architecture is taken as the main specialisation supported by the other Marine related disciplines. As such the graduates from this programme are versatile enough to serve the wide-ranging industries either as Naval Architects, Marine Engineers or as Mechanical Engineers. To evaluate on the impact of the Marine Technology programme on the industry, firstly a brief discussion on the state of the Malaysian Marine industry was made, followed by the choice of curriculum, development of facility, efforts made in gaining expertise, contributions of the graduates and lastly, the future outlook of the Marine Technology programme in Malaysia.

This paper gives some case studies in effective assessment strategies within engineering. The main contribution is to demonstrate how one can simultaneously meet a number of requirements with individual assessments and therefore be efficient in both the student and staff assessment load. The paper also proposes that assessments should be challenging and the benefits of expecting students to rise to this challenge and also how one can meet many independent learning objectives in a single assignment in order to manage the overall assessment load for staff and students. © 2013 SEFI.","efficient assessment; learning outcomes; professionalism","Assessment strategies; efficient assessment; Independent learning; Learning outcome; professionalism; Student development; Education; Engineering education; Students","Allan, M., Chisholm, C.U., (2008) The Development of Competencies for Engineers within a Global Context, , Engineering education conference; Becerra, V., (2012) MATLAB Assessment for Final Year Units, , HEA discipline workshop and seminar series 2011-12 on the use of MATLAB within engineering degrees; Brown, S., (2006) Using Formative Assessment to Promote Student Learning, , Presented at University of Leeds learning and teaching conference; Crozier, G., Reay, D., Clayton, J., The Socio-Cultural and Learning Experiences of Working-Class Students in Higher Education (2010) Improving Learning by Widening Participation, pp. 180-201. , In: David M., editors London, London,: Routledge; http://www.engc.org.uk/education-skills/accreditation/accreditation-and-approval, Engineering Council accreditation information.

One of them is through the use of games-based learning (GBL) technologies in classroom education, where the students are not only expected to learn by playing computer games, but also creating computer games. Two teacher surveys were conducted across primary schools in two separate regions in the West of Scotland to identify how GBL is being implemented within primary schools. The results showed that the use of GBL, especially the game making approach, was very limited. Following the surveys, several school-based field works were conducted to identify and compare the learning experience and outcomes from the teachers' and students' perspectives when using GBL and non-GBL (the traditional) approaches. This paper summarizes the result of one case study conducted at one primary school in Scotland. The participants were the teacher and her students in Primary 4 level. They were exposed to learning times tables using two different approaches, one using computer games and the other one without the use of computer games. The findings have shown that the learning outcome is slightly better when using computer games. However, in terms of the learning experience, the teacher's pedagogical style has a great influence on the students' preferences and enjoyment in learning for both approaches. Overall, the findings have strengthened the fact that using computer games does not eliminate the role of the teacher. To maximize the potential of a GBL approach, more training and exposure to GBL are needed to help the teachers increase their understanding and capacity in using this approach. With proper support from the teacher, GBL can make learning more engaging, provide better learning outcomes and make the process of learning less tedious. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer aided instruction; Computers for education; games based learning; human computer interaction; teacher and students experience","Classroom education; Constructivist learning; Curriculum for excellences; games based learning; Learning experiences; Process of learning; teacher and students experience; Teachers' and students' perspectives; Computer games; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Personnel training; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Computer aided instruction","Tang, S., Hanneghan, M., Rhalibi, A.E., Introduction to games-based learning (2009) Games-Based Learning Advancements for Multi-Sensory Human Computer Interfaces: Techniques and Effective Practices, pp. 1-77. , L.

Control Theory courses in engineering education are usually related to exercises in the laboratory or to projects. However, in order to understand complexity of control systems, the students need to possess an analytical understanding of abstract mathematical problems. Our main goal is to illustrate the theory through the robot project, but at the same time we force our students to train their analytical skills by mandatory exercises including problems of abstract mathematics. This paper describes our effort to motivate students to work with the theory. We conclude with our and students' own opinion on their work during the semester. Ideas for future development of this course are presented. © 2013 IEEE.","analytical skill; control theory; engineering mathematics; project based learning; robot project","Analytical skills; Engineering mathematics; Mathematical problems; Project based learning; Semester course; Teaching methods; Control theory; Dynamical systems; Engineering education; Students","Ahlgren, D.J., Verner, I.M., Robot Projects as Education Design Experiments (2005) Proceedings of International Conference on Engineering Education, 2, pp. 524-529; Andersen, A., Implementation of engineering product design using international student teamwork - To comply with future needs (2001) European Journal of Engineering Education, 26 (2), pp. 179-186; Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., (2001) A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, , New York: Longman; (2005) A Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area, , Bologna Working Group on Qualifications Frameworks Copenhagen: Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Bredgade 43, DK-1260 Copenhagen K, Denmark; Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning, , http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/educ/eqf/rec08_en.pdf, Commission of the European Communities; The European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (EQF), , http://ec.europa.eu/education/pub/pdf/general/eqf/broch_en.pdf, Commission of the European Communities; (2008) ELLEIEC-Enhancing Lifelong Learning in Electrical and Information Engineering; Project Supported by EACEA, , http://greenelleiec.eu/, ERASMUS NETWORK; No.: 142814-LLP-1-2008-FR-ERASMUS-ENW; Fischbein, E., (1987) Intuition in Science and Mathematics, an Educational Approach, pp. 121-142. , Reidel Publishing Company; Frank, M., Barzilai, A., Project-based technology: Instructional strategy for developing technological literacy (2006) Journal of Technology Education, 18 (1), pp. 39-53; Friesel, A., Guo, M., Husman, L., Vullum, N., Project in robotics at the Copenhagen University College of Engineering (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE, International Conference on Robotics & Automation, pp. 1375-1380. , New Orleans, LA, April; Friesel, A., Timcenko, O., Mathematical Modelling in Electronics and Medialogy - Sharing Experiences for Better Results (2011) ICEE2011, Belfast, North Ireland, ICEE: An International Conference on Engineering Education, pp. 21-26. , August Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK; Thiriet, J.M., Yahoui, H., Bonnaud, O., Friesel, A., Fremont, H., ELLEIEC Project: A contribution to harmonise the European Higher Education Area (2011) Journal sur l'Enseignement des Sciences et Technologies de L'information et des Systèmes; Dossier Spécial: Elleiec Implementation Issues in EIE: State of Advancement, EAEEIE2011, , 13-15 June Maribor, Slovenia; Friesel, A., Timcenko, O., Competition-motivated teamwork and narratives to motivate girls for engineering (2011) 22nd EAEEIE Annual Conference, , Maribor, Slovenia, 13-15 June; Friesel, A., Timcenko, O., Applied mathematics - Teaching math connected to practical projects in order to engage and motivate engineering undergraduates (2011) The 40th IGIP International Symposium on Engineering Education, COPEC - Science and Education Research Council, , March 27-30 Santos, Brazil; Hoffmann, M.H.W., Knowledge, skills, and competences.

Over the past few years, active learning has been recognized by the educational community as the most effective learning method, that involves direct, purposeful learning experiences, such as hands-on or field experiences. In this paper we will discuss the educational experience associated with the design and development of projects to motivate the students of Control and Automation Engineering and Electrical Engineering during a semester of Industrial Robotics and Integrated Manufacturing Systems courses. The key learning objectives and tools used to implement them and the evaluation results will be detailed. Our focus was to introduce how those multidisciplinary works could help the students increase their motivation and improve their professional skills such as problem solving, team work and leadership. Evaluation results show that those projects were effective in engaging the students and as well as an effective active learning tool. © 2013 IEEE.","engineering projects of undergraduate students; integrated manufacturing systems course; learning experience; robotics course","Control and automation; Design and Development; Educational community; Educational experiences; Integrated manufacturing systems; Learning experiences; Robotics course; Undergraduate students; Agile manufacturing systems; Curricula; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Motivation; Students","Panadero, C.F., Roman, J.V., Kloss, C.D., Impact of learning experiences using LEGO Mindstorms® in engineering courses (2010) IEEE Education Engineering (EDUCON), pp. 503-512. , Apr; CNPq/VALE S.A.

The development is based on four levels of teaching, viz., lecture notes, interactive tutorials, simulation exercises, and performing a real experiment remotely. The current facility has been developed to support an undergraduate theory course, 'Electronic Devices and Circuits' as a pre-laboratory session for a regular on-site laboratory. It can be also used as an alternative to a traditional laboratory especially for distance education programs, or for interdisciplinary first year courses not having lab component. The facility has also been developed as a teaching tool for classroom demonstrations. © 2013 IEEE.","interactive tutorials; remote experiments; simulation; virtual lab","Classroom demonstrations; Distance education programs; Interactive tutorials; On-site laboratories; Remote experiments; simulation; Undergraduate Courses; Virtual lab; Engineering education; Experiments; Laboratories; Teaching; Thermoelectric equipment; Virtual reality; E-learning","Dat, M., Patkar, E.S., Patil, M., Narendra, N., Shelke, S., Kamath, A., Ghosh, D., E-prayog: A new paradigm for electronics laboratories (2012) ICTEE, 2012 IEEE International Conference on Technology Enhanced Education, pp. 1-10. , 3-5 Jan; Yang, O., Yabo, D., Miaoliang, Z., Yuewei, H., Song, M., Yunjie, M., Ecvlab: A web-based virtual laboratory system for electronic circuit simulation (2005) Computational Science ICCS 2005, 3514, pp. 1015-1027. , (V.

Laudable though this may be, it does encourage some to concentrate on how to answer the usual questions that occur every year, rather than to learn the whole content of the module. Those students may achieve higher marks than they would otherwise do, but would they be less able to apply the content in novel situations? This paper records an evaluation of a proposed system that allows individual parts of past examination papers to be submitted to a search engine. The files used by the search engine are derived from a series of narrated and animated online lectures in digital circuit design. The resulting returns purport to offer a recommendation as to those lecture slides that are relevant for answering the question. The paper briefly describes the essential characteristics of the on-line lectures and how they are specified. The search mechanism is based on a conventional term frequency-inverse document frequency scheme. The post processing of the results prior to display are described and a mock-up of the interface is illustrated. The paper concludes with an objective and discursive evaluation of the results and indicates the path for future work. © 2013 IEEE.","distance learning; educational technology; electronic learning; examinations; hypertext systems; independent learning; information retrieval; on-line lectures; schematic capture; semantic tagging; teaching objects; term frequency-inverse document frequency","Electronic learning; examinations; Independent learning; on-line lectures; Semantic tagging; Term frequency-inverse document frequencies; Distance education; Educational technology; Engineering education; Hypertext systems; Information retrieval; Search engines; E-learning","Lauer, T., Muller, R., Trahasch, S., Learning with lecture recordings: Key issues for end-users (2004) Proc.

However, most of the remote laboratories today are simulated or else real, but with a fixed configuration. With the integration of telecommunication technologies and computer science with virtual instrumentation, real, remote laboratories can be developed and accessed through Internet in real time, ensuring a richer collaborative experience for the student while avoiding some of the growing limitations of traditional laboratories, such as the lack of enough work area, expensive instrumentation, lack of personnel, time assigned to a laboratory, and their availability in non-working office hours. In this paper, we present a method of creating a web-based Remote Laboratory Experimentation in the MSc course 'Wireless Communications Systems' which is part of 'Information and Communication Systems (ICS)' curriculum. This is done within the RIPLECS project (http://riplecs.dipseil.net/). The course 'Wireless Communication Systems' gives students an overview of the characteristics of different types of antennas used in wireless communications and the wave propagation in mobile communications. The practical part consists of several assignments dealing with understanding the basic functions of the antennas as well as mobile communication propagation characteristics experiments. The proposed approach integrates a traditional Learning Management System (LMS) with the remote access to real instrumentation located in wireless communication laboratory, without requiring specific software components on the client side.

Case studies of three such courses are explored in this work. Specifically, two American professors taught courses in English to about 90 students whose native language was Chinese. These courses included a required Electronics course for electrical engineering sophomores, a seminar on Medical Device Product Development within a required Biomedical Instrumentation course for juniors in biomedical engineering, and a lecture series on New Product Development for first year honors students. All courses included homework teams and active learning techniques in the classroom. Surveys were given to students throughout the courses. Statistical analyses of these surveys show that the Chinese students valued the homework team experience and believed that it helped them learn although some variation is seen among the courses. Peer evaluations of teamwork also showed that students responded well to homework teams. Despite considerable variation in their comfort with speaking English, the students did well in these courses taught in English with active learning techniques. © 2013 IEEE.","active learning; China; engineering students; teamwork; U.S.","Active Learning; Biomedical instrumentation; China; Electronics course; Engineering course; New product development; teamwork; U.S; Biomedical engineering; Electrical engineering; Electronic medical equipment; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Product development; Students; Surveys; Technical presentations; Teaching","Prince, M., Does active learning work?

This format, referred to as Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), has garnered considerable public attention, and has been invested with great hopes (and fears) of transforming higher education by opening up the walls of closed institutions to a world-wide audience. In this paper, we present two MOOCs that were hosted at the same platform, and have implemented the same learning design. Due to their difference in language, topic domain and difficulty, the communities that they brought into existence were very different. We start by describing the MOOC format in more detail, and the distinguishing features of openHPI. We then discuss the literature on communities of practice and cultures of participation. After some statistical data about the first openHPI course, we present our qualitative observations about both courses, and conclude by giving an outlook on an ongoing comparative analysis of the two courses. © 2013 IEEE.","community of practice; culture of participation; learner community; MOOC; online course","Communities of Practice; Community of practice; Comparative analysis; learner community; Massive open online course; MOOC; Online course; Qualitative observations; Engineering education; Knowledge acquisition; E-learning","McAuley, A., Stewart, B., Siemens, G., Cormier, D., (2100) The MOOC Model for Digital Practice, , http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/MOOC_Final.pdf, accessed 30.12.2012; Schillings, V., Meinel, C., Tele-TASK - Teleteaching anywhere solution kit (2002) Proceedings of ACM SIGUCCS, , Providence, USA; Sack, H., Baumann, B., Groß, A., Meinel, C., Linking tele-TASK video portal to the semantic web (2009) Proc. of 9 Th International Conference on Innovative Internet Community Systems (I2CS09), P-148, pp. 205-216. , Ch.

This architecture is applied to characterization of active and passive microwave devices. This remote laboratory is based on the use of a previously developed hardware interface FHI (Flexible Hardware Interface). FHI card is employed to the remote control of RF switches that serve to switch between ports or access of measurement and test instruments connected in various devices or Microwave stages. This method allows the remote characterization of several microwave devices using the same measuring instrument (Vector Network Analyzer for example). The same architecture is used for characterization of passive and active devices in microwave band. The passive devices may include patch antennas, filters, couplers..., and active ones like amplifier stages for example. These require other instruments for remote characterization in low and high RF power (RF generator, scope, spectrum analyzer, DC (Direct Current) power supplies...). Switching between instruments is made by the remote control of RF Switches connected to them. The instruments are exploited remotely using those specific interfaces. The remote control of RF Switches is made through HTML web interfaces specially developed for each application. This flexible architecture allows easy implementation of different and multiple distant electronic practical experiments in microwave domain for undergraduate engineering classes. The AJAX approach is used for the transfer of commands and data between the user and the hardware part of the remote laboratory. Results are stored in PhpMySql databases. © 2013 IEEE.","Ajax approach; FHI; flexible architecture; microwave devices; remote characterization; Remote-flexible laboratory; RF Switch; web interface","Ajax approach; FHI; Flexible architectures; RF switch; Web interface; Characterization; Engineering education; Hardware; Instruments; Laboratories; Microstrip antennas; Microwave devices; Passive filters; Remote control; Spectrum analyzers; Active filters","Farah, S., Benachenhou, A., Neveux, G., Barataud, D., Design of a flexible hardware interface for multiple remote electronic practical experiments of virtual laboratory (2012) IJOE, 8 (SPEC.

However, RAL technology is not as prevalent as other electronic learning tools. This study identifies considerations for the wider implementation, uptake and embedding of the Remote Access Laboratory system as an online learning tool across universities. The study explores whether and how the benefits offered by the RAL system can be extended to students in other disciplines and faculties, with a view to creating more equitable opportunities for student learning across the university. Investigating four learning activities in three different disciplines, evaluation questions in the areas of appropriateness, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability are addressed. The study concludes that the RAL approach is sufficiently open and flexible to suite a variety of learning objectives and pedagogies in a number of contexts. Some wider issues are significant to the uptake of RAL and this evaluation highlights main considerations to be addressed if RAL implementations are to occur more broadly across universities as learning systems. © 2013 IEEE.","learning system; practical learning activities; Remote Access Laboratory","Electronic learning; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning Activity; Learning objectives; Online learning tools; Remote access laboratories; Remote access laboratories (RAL); Research communities; Engineering education; Information technology; Learning systems; Societies and institutions; E-learning","Bowtell, L., Moloney, C., Kist, A.A., Parker, V., Maxwell, A., Reedy, N., Using remote access laboratories in nursing education (2012) 9th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation (REV 2012), , presented at the Bilbao, Spain; Orduna, P., Garcia-Zubia, J., Irurzun, J., Lopez-De-Ipina, D., Rodriguez-Gil, L., Enabling mobile access to remote laboratories (2011) Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2011 IEEE, pp. 312-318; Harward, V.J., Del Alamo, J.A., Lerman, S.R., Bailey, P.H., Carpenter, J., DeLong, K., Felknor, C., Zych, D., The iLab shared architecture: A web services infrastructure to build communities of internet accessible laboratories (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE, 96, pp. 931-950; Lowe, D., Murray, S., Weber, L., De La Villefromoy, M., Johnston, A., Lindsay, E., Nageswara, W., Nafalsk, A., LabShare: Towards a national approach to laboratory sharing (2009) 20th Annual Conference of the Australasian Association for Engineering Education (AaeE), , University of Adelaide; Lobo, M.C.C., Alves, G.R., Marques, M.A., Viegas, C., Barral, R.G., Couto, R.J., Jacob, F.L., Gustavsson, I., Using remote experimentation in a large undergraduate course: Initial findings (2011) Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), pp. S4G1-S4G7. , 2011; Kist, A.A., Gibbings, P., Inception and management of remote access laboratory projects (2010) AaeE 2010: 21st Annual Conference of the Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , presented at the Sydney, Australia; Kist, A.A., Maxwell, A., Gibbings, P., Expanding the concept of remote access laboratories (2012) 119th ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, , presented at the San Antonio, Texas; Kondraske, G.V., Volz, R.A., Johnson, D.H., Tesar, D., Trinkle, J.C., Price, C.R., Network-based infrastructure for distributed remote operations and robotics research (1993) Robotics and Automation, 9, pp. 702-704. , IEEE Transactions on; Aktan, B., Bohus, C.A., Crowl, L.A., Shor, M.H., Distance learning applied to control engineering laboratories (1996) Education, 39, pp. 320-326. , IEEE Transactions on; Ma, J., Nickerson, J., Hands-on, simualted and remote laboratories: A comparative literature review (2006) ACM Computing Surveys, 38, pp. 1-24. , V; Lindsay, E., (2005) The Impact of Remote and Virtual Access to Hardware Upon the Learning Outcomes of Undergraduate Engineering Laboratory Classes, , PhD, Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne; Trevelyan, J., Lessons learned from 10 years experience with remote laboratories (2004) International Conference on Engineering Education and Research, pp. 687-697. , VŠB-TUO, Ostrava; Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., (2005) The Role of the Laboratory in Undergraduate Engineering Education, 94, pp. 121-130; Arango, F., Chang, C., Esche, S., Chassapis, C., A scenario for collaborative learning in virtual engineering laboratories (2007) 37th ASEE/ISEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. F3G7-F3G12. , K.

These tools were initially heavily based on the technology of structure editing, with the aim of alleviating the burden of focusing on the syntactic details of programming languages and giving the chance to focus on acquiring problem solving skills. The technology of program animation was also utilized, in order to allow for a better comprehension of programming structures and flow of control. Furthermore, the ability of generating syntactically correct source code from the flowchart was integrated into these tools. Recently, several advanced features were added in flowchart-based programming environments, such as support for collaborative activities and distributed pair programming and usage in mobile devices. In this paper, a thorough review of programming environments based on an iconic notation is carried out with a focus on the support provided for introducing novices to programming, as well as other important software engineering issues in a simplified and straightforward manner.

In the case of educational applications, the interactive use of a second screen, such as mobile devices synchronized with digital TV contents using data connection, offers promising new possibilities. However, populations from some regions in the world are not part of this trend due to their lack of data connection or other technological infrastructures. This paper focuses on possible technical solutions to provide applications using mobile devices and digital TV, applied to an educational context. It also describes a user test carried out with students, exploring interaction with TV content through a second screen device. As a preliminary trial, it was very fruitful in providing information about Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) requirements for future next steps of this research. The focus was the educational toolset prototype 'Buddy Learning', and alternative options for providing the second screen experience were explored. Three research aims were considered: 1) developing a technical solution for transmitting data content for regions where data connection is inexistent or intermittent; 2) obtaining preliminary information about HCI requirements for learner interaction with the proposed system through a user test with the prototype; 3) stimulating and motivating undergraduate and graduate engineer students to develop solutions involving a digital TV infrastructure that would be workable in remote areas. © 2013 IEEE.","educational applications; Human-Computer Interaction; interactive digital TV; mobile devices; second screen","Educational Applications; Human computer interaction (HCI); Interactive digital TV; Learner interaction; Preliminary information; Second screens; Technical solutions; Technological infrastructure; Digital television; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Mobile devices; Research; Students; Interactive television","Srivastava, H.O., (2002) Interactive TV Technology and Market, 448p. , Norwood: Artech House; Teleco and TeleBrasil, , http://200.198.191.202/sistemas/telebrasil/index.php#, Open-to-air TV and mobile phones: general indicators from IBGE last accessed on 30/07/2012; (2008) Terrestrial Digital Television - Interactivity Channel, , Brazilian Association for Technical Standards.

The focus is on the initial accreditation process of engineering programs. Namely, QFD is utilized to illustrate the translation of program requirements into learning outcomes, curriculum, and assessment tools. Program requirements are set by local accreditation agencies, program stakeholders, and the strategic plan of the hosting college/university. QFD is used to design program curriculum (courses and learning units) so that program learning outcomes are achieved. A subsequent QFD is also used to design the assessment tools of each course so that course learning outcomes are achieved. An assessment plan is to be then designed and deployed after the engineering program is approved by the accreditation body. That is a key step to assure the quality of proposed engineering programs by addressing the needs of different program constituents (accreditation bodies, employers, prospective students, market, educational standards, professional associations, and qualification frameworks). The objective is to improve the quality of proposed engineering program as well as the performance of running programs and programs under review. An example of QFD application to the initial accreditation of a Master of Project Management is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. © 2013 IEEE.","Accreditation; Assessment Tools; Engineering; Learning Outcomes; Quality Function Deployment","Accreditation process; Assessment tool; Educational standards; Engineering program; Learning outcome; Professional associations; Program learning; Quality improvement; Accreditation; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Program translators; Project management; Quality function deployment; Tools; Application programs","Mizuno, S., Akao, Y., QFD: The customer-driven approach to quality planning and deployment (1994) Asian Productivity Organization; Akao, Y., (1990) QFD: Integrating Customer Requirements into Product Design, , (Cambridge, MA Productivity Press); Akao, Y., New product development and quality assurance - Quality deployment system (1972) Standardization and Quality Control, 25 (4), pp. 7-14; Besterfield, D.H., Besterfield, C., Besterfield, G.H., Besterfield, M., (2003) Total Quality Management, 287, pp. 317-318. , 3rd ed; Bossert, J.L., (1991) Quality Function Deployment.

The statistical process control technique (SPC) provides enhanced results, as it utilizes statistical methods throughout all the developmental stages of a project and/or production. One of these techniques is control charts, which are powerful tools for viewing and understanding different types of process variations. Therefore, it is essential for professionals linked to engineering and technological fields to be familiar with these techniques and software programs, in order to facilitate the development process for creating control charts. The majority of these software programs designed for easy utilization and friendly interface for SPC applications are sold at high prices and thereby make access impossible to this computational resource for freelance professionals, small businesses, and especially students. The GNU R interface is open source and provides free access as one of the alternatives. So, for this purpose, this paper presents the description and application of control charts in three different R interfaces, as its objective is to use them for the teaching and learning process. © 2013 IEEE.","R Commander; RExcel; RStudio; Statistical Quality Control","Computational resources; Development process; Developmental stage; R Commander; RExcel; RStudio; Statistical quality control; Teaching and learning; Computer software; Engineering education; Flowcharting; Quality control; Statistical methods; Statistical process control","Louzada, F., Ara, A., Oliveira, C.Z., Gonçalvez, C.V., Diagnóstico do ensino de estatística nas universidades públicas brasileiras: uma descrição de algumas das dimensões que compõem o perfil de seu corpo docente (2010) Revista Brasileira de Estatística, 71 (234), pp. 7-42. , C.

This way, students can experiment as if they were using the laboratories with their own hands. There are usually two approaches when designing remote laboratories: relying on small, inexpensive devices that can be deployed anywhere or relying software rich software infrastructures that support high load of users, providing panel administration, access to other institutional servers (e.g. directories such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 'LDAP'), etc. With distributed remote laboratory architectures, it is possible to have the laboratory server on the former approach, but the management usually relies on the latter. In certain entities, such as secondary schools or farm schools, they may not be willing to buy and maintain a dedicated server for remote laboratories, and therefore the former approach is more adequate. However, a tradeoff is being made between management capabilities and how easy is to deploy the system. This contribution shows how federation could help in solving this tradeoff, and it uses a real fish tank remote laboratory as a case study. © 2013 IEEE.","federation; low-costsystems; remote-labs","Educational institutions; federation; Lightweight Directory Access protocols; low-costsystems; Management capabilities; Remote-labs; Software and hardwares; Software infrastructure; Engineering education; Fish; Internet protocols; Societies and institutions; Tanks (containers); Laboratories","Harward, V.J., Del Alamo, J.A., Lerman, S.R., Bailey, P.H., Carpenter, J., DeLong, K., Felknor, C., Jabbour, I., The iLab shared architecture: A web services infrastructure to build communities of internet accessible laboratories (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE, 96 (6), pp. 931-950; Orduña, P., Rodriguez-Gil, L., López-De-Ipiña, D., Garcia-Zubia, J., Sharing the remote laboratories among different institutions: A practical case (2012) Remote Engineering Virtual Instrumentation 2012, , REV July 2012; Harnett, C., Open source hardware for instrumentation and measurement (2011) IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society, IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society ISSN: 1094-6969, 14 (3). , June; García Zubia, J., Orduña, P., Angulo, I., Irurzun, J., Hernández, U., Towards a distributed architecture for remote laboratories (2008) Online Journal IJOE (International Journal of Online Engineering, 4. , ISSN: 1861-2121.

One of the approaches that is highly promoted under the CfE is GBL. This paper presents a case study conducted at a primary school in Scotland that demonstrated the use of games as a context for interdisciplinary learning. The findings suggest that the students were fully engaged and motivated throughout the learning process and learned constructively through the activities and social interaction. Findings from this case study will contribute to the growing research in the field of GBL towards making learning more appealing and relevant to the younger generation. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer aided instruction; Computers for education; games based learning; human computer interaction; teacher and students experience","Active Learning; Curriculum for excellences; games based learning; Interdisciplinary learning; Learning process; Social interactions; teacher and students experience; Younger generations; Computer games; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Research; Students; Computer aided instruction","Prensky, M., The games generations: How learners have changed (2001) Digital Game-Based Learning, pp. 35-51. , ed: McGraw-Hill; Simpson, E., Evolution in the classroom: What teachers need to know about the video game generation (2005) TechTrends: Linking Research & Practice to Improve Learning, 49, pp. 17-22; Gee, J.P., What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy (2005) ACM Computers in Entertainment, 1; Kirriemuir, J., McFarlane, A., (2004) Literature Review in Games and Learning, , Bristol; Van Eck, R., Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless (2006) EDUCAUSE Review, 41, pp. 16-18; Visser, J., Integrity, completeness and comprehensiveness of the learning environment: Meeting the basic learning needs of all throughout liferethinking (2001) International Handbook of Lifelong Learning, 2, pp. 447-472. , 2, D.

They can be found in autos, washing machines, electrical appliances and even in toys. FPGAs are the most recent computing technology that is used in embedded systems. There is an increasing demand on FPGA based embedded systems, in particular, for applications that require rapid time responses. Engineering education curricula needs to respond to the increasing industrial demand of using FPGAs by introducing new syllabus for teaching and learning this subject. This paper describes the development of new course material for teaching FPGA-based embedded systems design by using 'G' Programming Language of LabVIEW. A general overview of FPGA role in engineering education is provided. A survey of available Hardware Programming Languages for FPGAs is presented. A survey about LabVIEW utilization in engineering education is investigated; this is followed by a motivation section of why to use LabVIEW graphical programming in teaching and its capabilities. Then, a section of choosing a suitable kit for the course is laid down. Later, constructivist dynamical model of learning has been developed in accordance with [2-4]. The models are analyzed and their implications are highlighted. This followed by an overview of the designed educational examples of FPGA programming with LabVIEW for the selected kit, in accordance with the developed learning model. To expand the kit educational capacity, new external modules and peripherals have been designed. These extras are explained in details. The teaching and learning manuals of the experiments were developed in a manner that allows student-centred learning approach. Furthermore, additional video tutorials were developed to foster a self-regulated learning and lower dependence on teacher. The final section explains how LabVIEW can be used for developing a hybrid access mode Lab for the experiments (Virtual, Hands-on and Remote), in accordance with [5, 6]. The model will be applied next semester, and the paper is proposing a pedagogical framework for FPGA teaching; pedagogical evaluation will be conducted in future studies. The complete study has been done at the Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Aleppo. © 2013 IEEE.","Embedded FPGA Systems; Engineering Education; Hands-on; LabVIEW; Pedagogy; Remote Lab","Embedded fpga systems; Hands-on; LabViEW; Pedagogy; Remote-labs; Computer graphics; Curricula; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Experiments; Surveys; Teaching","Balid, W., Abdulwahed, M., Multipurpose Open Source Embedded Systems Laboratory Kit for Engaging Students towards Experiential Education (2009) Annual ASEE Global Colloquium on Engineering Education, , Budapest, Hungary, Oct; Balid, W., Al-Rouh, I., Alhaj Dibo, M., YES, Constructivist Project Based Learning Could be the Magical Cure for Engaging Future Engineers!

The laboratories include building a digital circuit using logic blocks, doing a computer simulation, and using a programmable logic device (PLD). The effectiveness of the teaching method is evaluated based on students' feedbacks, backgrounds, opinions, and scores. The tools, used in this research, are a set of lab sheets, a computer simulation program called 'Digital Works', and a portable equipment box. After two consecutive years of teaching and using the supplementary laboratory in the digital circuit and logic design class, the students have the same opinions that the laboratory helps them to understand the theories, they will be able to apply the knowledge to the related advance courses, and they agree that all 3 parts of the laboratory are necessary and encourage them to have more hands-on skill. In addition, students' scores show that the students have better grades in average by using the supplementary laboratory. © 2013 IEEE.","Digital circuit and logic design; Laboratory; Pre-service vocational teacher; Teaching methodology","Design course; Laboratory set-up; Logic blocks; Pre-service vocational teacher; Programmable logic device; Teaching methodologies; Teaching methods; Thailand; Computer simulation; Engineering education; Logic design; Logic devices; Students; Teaching; Laboratories","A comparison of teaching efficacy, commitment to teaching profession and satisfaction with program effectiveness of teacher students under the 5 year-program curriculum and those under the 4+1 year-program curriculum (2010) European Journal of Social Sciences, 14, pp. 250-261. , Prawit Erawan.

Engineering is a discipline which has, by its own definition, a large amount of practical contents. Allowing students to interact with real equipment can give to them a qualitative knowledge that cannot be obtained in other way. In this situation, remote laboratories are especially useful. This paper presents a way of reusing remote labs code by its XML representation. The idea is that students learn not only the basic subjects of the course, even more, that students do not only manipulate lab equipment. The idea is to give the students a practical way to check the potential of work organization and to give a taste of the powerfulness of code reusing, that is, in the end, a way to improve work efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.","distributed systems; engineering education; remote laboratories; Reusing code","Distributed systems; Higher education; Modular approach; Qualitative knowledge; Remote laboratories; Reusing code; Work organization; XML representation; Engineering education; Laboratories; XML; Students","Jara, C.A., Candelas, F.A., Puente, S.T., Torres, F., Hands-on experiences of undergraduate students in automatics and robotics using a virtual and remote laboratory (2011) Computers & Education, 57 (4), pp. 2451-2461. , December; Martin, S., Diaz, G., Sancristobal, E., Gil, R., Castro, M., Peire, J., New technology trends in education: Seven years of forecasts and convergence (2011) Computers & Education, 57 (3), pp. 1893-1906. , November; Fabregas, E., Farias, G., Dormido-Canto, S., Dormido, S., Esquembre, F., Developing a remote laboratory for engineering education (2011) Computers & Education, 57 (2), pp. 1686-1697. , September; Hardison, J.L., DeLong, K., Bailey, P.H., Harward, V.J., Deploying interactive remote labs using the iLab shared architecture (2008) Frontiers in Education Conference, 2008, pp. S2A1-S2A6. , FIE 2008. 38th Annual 22-25 Oct; Pastor, R., Sanchez, D., Aliane, N., Hernandez, R., Mariscal, G., Robles-Gomez, A., Caminero, A., Castro, M., Structured remote laboratory development (2012) Technologies Applied to Electronics Teaching (TAEE), 2012, pp. 314-319. , 13-15 June; Xia, H.-W., An exploratory study on specialized high school education and instruction (1995) Technology and Vocational Education, 28, pp. 32-34; Pastor, R., Sanchez, D., Aliane, N., Hernández, R., Robles-Gómez, A., Caminero, A., Ros, S., Castro, M., Practical experiences on building structured remote and virtual laboratories from the student's point of view (2012) Frontiers in Education Conference; http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136424.html, last access on 12/03/2012; Wellings, A., Clark, R., Jensen, D., Wells, D., A framework for integrating the real-time specification for Java and Java's remote method invocation (2002) Object-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing, 2002, pp. 13-22. , (ISORC 2002).

Most of the data is collected from Learning Management Systems deployed at established educational institutions. In addition, other learning platforms, most notably Massive Open Online Courses such as Udacity and Coursera or other educational initiatives such as Khan Academy, generate large amounts of data. However, there is no generally agreedupon data model for student interactions. Thus, analysis tools must be tailored to each system's particular data structure, reducing their interoperability and increasing development costs. Some e-Learning standards designed for content interoperability include data models for gathering student performance information. In this paper, we describe how well-known LA tools collect data, which we link to how two e-Learning standards - IEEE Standard for Learning Technology and Experience API - define their data models. From this analysis, we identify the advantages of using these e-Learning standards from the point of view of Learning Analytics. © 2013 IEEE.","e-Learning Standards; educational data mining; Experience API; Learning Analytics; SCORM","E-learning standards; Educational data mining; Experience API; Learning Analytics; SCORM; E-learning; Engineering education; Interoperability; Models; Standards; Students; Tools; Information management","Paulsen, M.F., Experiences with learning management systems in 113 european institutions (2003) Educational Technology & Society, 6 (4), pp. 134-148; (2010) 7 Things You Should Know About Analytics, , EDUCASE; Kop, R., The challenges to connectivist learning on open online networks: Learning experiences during a massive open online course (2010) European Distance and E-learning Network Annual Conference, , 2010 Paper H4 32; De Laat, M., (2006) Networked Learning, , Utrecht Universiteit; Cambpell, J.P., DeBlois, P.B., Oblinger, D.G., Academic analytics A new tool for a new era (2007) EDUCAUSE Review, 42 (4), pp. 42-57. , August 2007; Friesen, N., Interoperability and learning objects: An overview of E-learning standardization (2005) Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects, 1, pp. 23-31; (2004) IEEE 1484.11.1, Draft 5 Draft Standard for Learning Technology - Data Model for Content Object Communication, , IEEE; (2003) IEEE 1484.11.2/D2 Draft Standard for Learning Technology - ECMAScript Application Programming Interface for Content to Runtime Services Communication, , IEEE; Experience API Version 0.95, , ADL-Co-Laboratories; Dawson, S., Bakharia, A., Heathcote, E., SNAPP: Realising the affordances of real-time SNA within networked learning environments (2010) Learning, pp. 125-133; Ali, L., Hatala, M., Gaševic, D., Jovanovic, J., A qualitative evaluation of evolution of a learning analytics tool (2012) Computers & Education, 58 (1), pp. 470-489; Arnold, M.D., Pistilli, K.E., Course signals at purdue: Using learning analytics to increase student success (2012) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge, , New York: ACM; Koedinger, J., Baker, K., Cunningham, R., Skogsholm, K., Leber, A., Stamper, B., (2010) A Data Repository for the EDM Community: The PSLC Datashop, , CRC Press; Siemens, F., Gasevic, G., Haythornthwaite, D., Dawson, C., Shum, S., Duval, R.R., Verbert, E., Baker, K., (2011) Open Learning Analytics: An Integrated and Modularized Platform: Proposal to Design, Implement and Evaluate an Open Platform to Integrate Heterogeneous Learning Analytics Techniques, , S; Khan, S., Khan academy (2011) Educational Technology, , http://www.khanacademy.org/; (2006) JSON Activity Streams 1.0, , ActivityStreamsWorkingGroup; (2004) IMS Shareable State Persistence, Version 1.0 Final Specification, , IMS Global Consortium; Serrano, A., Marchiori, E.J., Del Blanco, A., Torrente, J., Fernandez-Manjon, B., A framework to improve evaluation in educational games (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1-8","Complutense University of Madrid, C Profesor José García Santesmases sn, 28040 Madrid, Spain",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Remote engineering allows not only solving, in original manner, the contradictions of some technical problems, but also produce an indirect effect. It means that students will meet the case of inversion: the group of trainers, best ones, will offer hers creations, to the each student, individually.

From the results of such research, it is pointed out which features one wants in the LO so that it successfully promotes learning. It is in this perspective that this work was conceived having as goal the development of LO, admitting that this may be a possible alternative to represent models of interactions, which occur within the area, thereby improving understanding of physical concepts, in particular those involved with the subject of electrical circuits. It has also as objective to characterize the learning process through a series of situations that are replicated leading to a set of behaviors from the students.

Two active learning models, namely, cooperative and collaborative learning were used. The population of the study consisted of thirty-eight third year students enrolled in the Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering program in one of the universities in one of the Caribbean Island. The post-test only control group experimental design was employed for the study while the instruments used to collect data were midterm tests and a final examination. The data collected was subjected to an independent t-test analysis (α = 0.05), using the SPSS statistical software application. The findings indicated that students taught with traditional lecturing performed significantly better (mean P = 0.01) than those taught using active learning strategies. Males and female participants taught with traditional lecturing also performed better than their counterparts taught with active learning. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that students be better sensitized about new teaching strategies being implemented, Particle Technology teachers recognize the value of traditional lecturing, appropriate measures be implemented to achieve comparable attendance among study groups and future studies should focus on understanding the characteristics of female students which results in them exhibiting enhanced learning compared to their male counterparts. © 2013 IEEE.","comparative; engineering; instructional; particle technology; performances; strategies","comparative; instructional; Particle technology; performances; strategies; Application programs; Engineering; Software testing; Students; Teaching; Technology; Engineering education","Prince, M., Does active learning work?

At the same time, there is a growing trend to open the services that the companies offer on the web with open APIs and in the form of REST services, facilitating their integration in customized applications. The goal of this work is to show how such open services can be used for the support of on-line educational systems. These services were not created for an education context, so it is necessary to complement it with functionalities for supporting aspects such as evaluations, monitoring or collaboration.

We briefly review some of the basic Fourier series theory, and present an Android application that has been found useful in this context. As expected, the application has an easy-to-use, friendly interface, and can be viewed as a tool to help undergraduate students test and assess the Fourier series expansions on a typical set of signals, whose analytical Fourier series coefficients were found during the theoretical lectures. Additionally, students can also control the total approximation error and the number of terms/harmonics used in the expansion. It seems that our students prefer this Android application to the traditional applet fashioned web-based applications. © 2013 IEEE.","Android Application; Fourier Series Expansions; Undergraduate Electrical Engineering Education","Android applications; Approximation errors; Fourier-series expansion; Undergraduate education; Undergraduate students; Web-based applications; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Expansion; Fourier series; Students","Harris, P., (2001), http://www.astd.org/; Tolstov, G.P., (1976) Fourier Series, , N.Y.: Dover Publications Inc; Brigham, E.O., (1974) The Fast Fourier Transform, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Ambardar, A., (1995) Analog and Digital Signal Processing, , Boston, MA: PWS Publishing Company; Jerri, A.J., (2011) Advances in the Gibbs Phenomenon, , Sampling Publishing","University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD), , 5001-801 Vila Real, Portugal",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

This study proposes an adaptive approach to diagnose and feedback students, and makes use of the Item Response Theory to estimate skill levels and classify the students. In addition, it uses a model of concepts' relationship between the concepts and the items of the test. The purpose is to diagnose students' cognitive problems and provide personalized and intelligent learning suggestions. This approach can be used as a system of intelligent diagnosis that receives a set of responses, and generates a data set of weak concepts for each student, specifying their learning path and resulting in clustering individuals who share the same shortcomings to ease any process of group feedback. © 2013 IEEE.","Clustering; Item Response Theory; Relationships between Concepts","Adaptive approach; Clustering; Intelligent diagnosis; Intelligent learning; Item response theory; Learning achievement; Learning problem; Relationships between Concepts; Engineering education; Students","Lord, F.M., (1980) Applications of Item Response Theory to Practical Testing Problems, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hinsdale, NJ; Hwang, G.J., Hsiao, C.L., Tseng, J.C.R., A ComputerAssisted approach to diagnosing student learning problems in science courses (2003) Journal of Information Science and Engineering, 19, pp. 229-248; Conejo, R., Guzmán, E., Millán, E., Pérez-De-La-Cruz, J.L., Trella, M., Ríos, A., SIETTE: A web-based tool for adaptive testing (2004) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 29-61; Muangnak, N., Pukdee, W., Hengsanunkun, T., Classification students with learning disabilities using naïve bayes classifier and decision tree (2010) Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management (NCM), , Fac. of Sci. & Eng., Kasetsart Univ., Sakonnakhon, Thailand.

The strategy is shown to align with current recommendations for best practice. The proposal is extensively used by the author in his teaching and two engineering courses are presented as case-studies to illustrate how the approach works. These courses were evaluated using an established student questionnaire. 91% of respondents stated that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with assessment and feedback as it applied to these courses. Grades awarded to final version of the assignment were, on average, 11% higher than those awarded to the draft.

The laboratory is designed as a 3D virtual collaborative system with carefully developed instructional sequences covering different, often overlapping teaching subjects. The central object to every lab is a composite model of PC whose basic components are suitable for teaching computer architecture, programming, and operating systems courses. The same PC model is also used in conjunction with other composite 3D models of hardware for networking and net-centered courses. The 3D computing lab that we develop offers two advantages. First, composite component model it applies helps students gain a complete understanding of computing technology through interleaving problems viewed from different perspectives. Second, by following students' activities and progress, instructors can easily identify the most difficult teaching concepts and modify their syllabi accordingly. © 2013 IEEE.","3D models; computing education; technology-enhanced learning; virtual lab","3D models; Collaborative systems; Computer science curricula; Computing education; Introductory computing course; Operating systems course; Technology enhanced learning; Virtual lab; Computer architecture; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Laboratories; Three dimensional; Distance education","(2012) Computer Science Curriculum, , http://www.acm.org/education/curricula/ComputerScience2008.pdf; (2012), http://openwonderland.org/; Kim, I.-G., Bae, D.-H., Hong, J.-E., A component composition model providing dynamic, flexible, and hierarchical composition of components for supporting software evolution (2007) Journal of Systems and Software, 80 (11), pp. 1797-1816. , Elsevier Inc., New York; De Freitas, S., (2008) Serious Virtual Worlds - Scoping Study, , http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/ seriousvirtualworldsv1.pdf; Hua, M., Zhang, H.-Y., Zhen, C., VLab-CC: A generic framework of virtual laboratory based on component composition (2009) International Conference on Information Technology and Computer Science, pp. 585-588; Yankelovich, N., (2012) Using Open Wonderland in Education, , http://www.slideshare.net/nicoley/open-wonderland-for-education; Gardner, M., Ganem-Gutierrez, A., Scott, J., Horan, B., Callaghan, V., Immersive education spaces using open wonderland: From pedagogy through to practice (2011) Multi-User Virtual Environments for the Classroom: Practical Approaches to Teaching in Virtual Worlds, , ISBN 978-1-60960-545-2; Dos Santos, F.R., Guetl, C., Bailey, P.H., Judson Harward, V., Dynamic virtual environment for multiple physics experiments in higher education (2010) IEEE EDUCON, pp. 731-736; Baljak, V., Honiden, S., Discovery of configurations for IndoorWireless sensor networks through use of simulation in VirtualWorlds (2010) Fourth International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications, pp. 323-328; Apostolos, M., Andreas, K., Thrasyvoulos, T., Collaboration in 3D collaborative virtual learning environments: Open source vs. Proprietary solutions (2010) International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems, pp. 124-131","Department of Informatics and Computing, , Belgrade, Serbia",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

The advent of a plurality of cheaper and more powerful devices, having the ability to play, create, and transmit video content, has led to a dramatic increase in the multimedia content distribution, especially for engineering educational purposes on both wireline (e.g., cable) and wireless networks. Also, the reduction of cost of digital video cameras along with the development of user-generated content video sites (e.g., YouTube™) stimulated a new user-generated video content sector and made very strong demands for the high-quality and low-delay video communication, especially for online education courses and lectures in the engineering field. In addition, much of the attention in the field of video/multimedia adaptation is currently directed to the SVC, which is an extension of the H.264/AVC video standard. A major requirement for the SVC is to enable encoding of a high-quality video stream that contains one or more subset video streams, each of which can have for example, various temporal and spatial resolutions (i.e., QCIF, CIF, 720p, 1080p) to be presented on heterogeneous user devices, such as mobile/cellular phones, laptops, personal computers, TV sets, and the like. In this work, we focus on online multimedia engineering education by employing Region-of-Interest SVC, thereby enabling to provide an ultimate solution for streaming educational multimedia content to a plurality of heterogeneous end-user devices. © 2013 IEEE.","heterogeneous enduser devices; high-quality visual presentation; online multimedia education; Region-of-Interest; Scalable Video Coding","Digital video cameras; End users; High-quality visual presentations; Multimedia content distribution; Multimedia education; Region of interest; Temporal and spatial; User-generated content; Cost engineering; Curricula; Engineering education; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Multimedia services; Personal computers; Scalable video coding; Video recording; Video streaming; E-learning","Schwarz, H., Marpe, D., Wiegand, T., Overview of the scalable video coding extension of the H.264/AVC standard (2007) IEEE Trans.

A typical example is the Intravenous (IV) pump infusion driver. Traditional training methods have relied upon on-campus practical group training sessions. Recent work in this area has demonstrated that Remote Access Laboratories (RAL) can be employed to enhance nursing education by providing access to an IV pump driver learning activity. The prototype closely mimicked the interface and audible feedback of a commonly used IV pump driver; and controlled a peristaltic pump to deliver the prescribed rates and volumes. This project takes this approach a step further and investigates a completely emulated interface in the same RAL environment. The aim is to target five problem areas that were previously identified. These include the screen navigation and data entry of the IV pump driver; and the correct calculation and entry of medication volumes and rates from a standard fluid chart. To address these issues the learning environment was modified to include a guided learning mode, integrated scaffolding resources and facility of self-assessment. This paper discusses implementation and results of a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. Initial results are promising and show a distinct improvement in the practical capability of those students who participated in the trial. © 2013 IEEE.","emulation; nursing; remote access laboratories","Clinical practices; emulation; Learning Activity; Learning environments; Nursing education; Remote access laboratories; Remote access laboratories (RAL); Training sessions; Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Navigation charts; Nursing; Pumps; Scaffolds; Students; Driver training","Kondraske, G.V., Volz, R.A., Johnson, D.H., Tesar, D., Trinkle, J.C., Price, C.R., Network-based infrastructure for distributed remote operations and robotics research (1993) Robotics and Automation, 9, pp. 702-704. , IEEE Transactions on; Aktan, B., Bohus, C.A., Crowl, L.A., Shor, M.H., Distance learning applied to control engineering laboratories (1996) Education, 39, pp. 320-326. , IEEE Transactions on; Kist, A.A., Maxwell, A., Gibbings, P., Expanding the concept of remote access laboratories (2012) 119th ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, , presented at the San Antonio, Texas; White, R.T., The link between the laboratory and learning (1996) International Journal of Science Education, 18, pp. 761-774; Barak, M., Instructional principles for fostering learning with ICT: Teachers' perspectives as learners and instructors (2006) Education and Information Technologies, 11, pp. 121-135; Slangen, L.A.M.P., Sloep, P.B., Mind tools contributing to an ICT-rich learning environment for technology education in primary schools (2005) International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Life Long Learning, 15, pp. 225-239; Jonassen, D.H., (2000) Computers as Mindtools for Schools: Engaging Critical Thinking, , Merrill; Jonassen, D., Carr, C., Yueh, H.-P., Computers as mindtools for engaging learners in critical thinking (1998) TechTrends, 43, pp. 24-32; Levett-Jones, T., The 'five rights' of clinical reasoning: An educational model to enhance nursing students' ability to identify and manage clinically 'at risk' patients (2010) Nurse Education Today, 30, pp. 515-520; Harder, N., Use of simulation in teaching and learning in health sciences: A systematic review (2010) Journal of Nursing Education, 49, pp. 23-28; Pike, T., O'Donell, V., The impact of clinical simulation on learner self-efficacy in pre-registration nursing education (2010) Nurse Education Today; Messmer, P., Enhancing nurse-physician collaboration using pediatric simulation (2008) Journal of Continuing Education in Nursing, 39; Rauen, Simulation as a teaching strategy for nursing education and orientation in cardiac surgery (2004) Critical Care Nurse, 24, pp. 46-51; Bandman, E., Bandman, B., (1995) Critical Thinking in Nursing; Sampsel, D., Bharwani, G., Mehling, D., Smith, S., Robots as faculty: Student and faculty perceptions (2010) Clinical Simulation in Nursing, , In Press, Corrected Proof; (2007) Robot Joins Nursing Institute of West Central Ohio to Address Faculty Shortage, , Medical-News-Today; Bowtell, L., Moloney, C., Kist, A.A., Parker, V., Maxwell, A., Reedy, N., Using remote access laboratories in nursing education (2012) 9th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation (REV 2012), , presented at the Bilbao, Spain; Kist, A.A., Gibbings, P., Inception and management of remote access laboratory projects (2010) AaeE 2010: 21st Annual Conference of the Australasian Association for Engineering Education, , presented at the Sydney, Australia","Faculty of Engineering and Surveying, , Toowoomba, Australia",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

The Multimedia for Information and Communication Systems (ICS) module developed by DEIS CIT for the RIPLECS project integrates the fundamentals of current user generated web content with remote delivery over a cloud infrastructure. The module provides students with theoretical and technical skills in various areas of multimedia technology and design, and incorporates assessment methods with these practical elements. Students are offered a basic introduction to four multimedia subjects; 3D animation, video editing, web development using HTML5 and content management systems. The students are then required to complete tasks as part of a continuous assessment for each of the four subjects. This paper outlines the design of the Multimedia module, describes the structure and scheduling of the module for delivery, the set-up of the remote laboratory in Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) and the role of DEIS CIT in the delivery of the course, both academically and administratively.

More specifically, maintenance of electric machines and installations is particularly important, since eventual failures in these elements may lead to significant losses in terms of time and money. Due to these facts, the investment and concern in developing proper maintenance protocols have been gradually growing up over these recent years. As a consequence, there is a need to provide future engineers with a solid background in the electric machines and installations maintenance area. The subject 'Maintenance of Electric Machines and Installations' has been designed with this purpose. It is taught within an official master degree in Maintenance Engineering. The paper describes the educational experiences reached during the initial years of the teaching of the subject, emphasizing aspects such as the student profiles, the subject approaches, the design of the syllabus, the methodology and the structure of the laboratory sessions. Moreover, the paper discusses other educational strategies which are being introduced to increase the interest in the subject, such as integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), promotion of the collaborative work, inclusion of the possibility of remote learning or development of new assessment systems. © 2013 IEEE.","collaborative work; e-learning; electric machines; industrial maintenance; teaching platforms","Collaborative Work; Educational experiences; Educational strategy; Industrial maintenance; Information and Communication Technologies; Laboratory sessions; Machine fault diagnosis; Teaching platform; E-learning; Electric losses; Electric machinery; Engineering education; Information technology; Maintenance; Electric fault currents","González Fernández, F.J., Industrial maintenance in Spain: How to optimize resources and reduce costs (2012) El Mantenimiento Industrial en España: Cómo Optimizar Recursos y Ahorrar Costes, , original Sevilla, February; Mubray, J., (2001) Reliability-Centered Maintenance, , 2nd edition, Industrial Press Inc; Thomson, W.T., Fenger, M., Current signature analysis to detect induction motor faults (2001) IEEE Ind.

An effective assessment system requires mastering the professional knowledge and skills involved. The field of assessment and evaluation has developed many important concepts, principles, and methods to guide practice. This study proposes an intelligent assessment management system for the summative assessment of college courses. It integrates a virtual online assessment management system and in-classroom examinations. Before an exam, the scope of the examination is selected by teachers, and students who will take the exam are listed. According to the number of students, the system configures the range of examination rooms. Students can go to any of the examination rooms to take the exam during the exam period. Each table has a near-field communication (NFC)-enabled tablet for student identification via a student APP. The identification process uses digital certificates to ensure uniqueness and to avoid substitute testers. Invigilators use an exam management APP to access information about the students taking the exam in the exam room, and give feedback regarding the real-time situation to the system. Instructors use the assessment management APP to check students' situation after the exam. The system ensures that all students receive fair treatment during the exam. The proposed system improves the effectiveness of assessment. © 2013 IEEE.","APP; assessment effectiveness; assessment management system; digital certificate; in-classroom examinations; near-field communication (NFC); summative assessment","APP; assessment effectiveness; Digital certificates; in-classroom examinations; Management systems; Near-field communication; Summative assessments; Communication; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Information management","Liu, X., Saddik, A.E., Georganas, N.D., An implementable architecture of an e-learning system (2003) IEEE Electrical and Computer Engineering Canadian Conference, 2, pp. 717-720. , May; Chen, G., The research on architecture of intelligent e-learning system (2009) IEEE International Conference on Computer Science & Education, Nanning, pp. 1079-1081. , July; Pang, H., Yang, S., Bian, L., A web services based online training and exam system (2008) IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications Networking and Mobile Computing, pp. 1-4. , Dalian October; Hang, B., The design and implementation of on-line examination system (2011) IEEE International Symposium on Computer Science and Society, pp. 227-230. , Kota Kinabalu July; Xiuying, W., Fang, Z., The online testing system with explain function as students answer mistake (2011) IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine and Education, Cuangzhou, 2, pp. 456-460. , December; Wang, H., Zhong, R., Design and Implementation of Online Exam system Based on Data Mining (2011) IEEE International Conference on Internet Computing and Information Services, pp. 207-209. , Hong Kong September","Department of Electrical Engineering, , Tainan, Taiwan",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

They can be designed in particular for virtual worlds. Virtual worlds are becoming an interesting medium for engineering education for the properties of visual collaboration abilities providing authentic learning experiences and for the opportunity of providing active learning. However, virtual worlds need more educational support to be more inhabited with increased learning services. Incorporating intelligent pedagogical agents into virtual worlds adds such learning support by adding intelligence, improving believability, and the opportunity to increase communication with an artificial educator. However the implementation of intelligent pedagogical agents and adopting them in a virtual world require several efforts with different aspects of implementation. This paper reports our first prototype implementation of an IPA interacting with a learner and a learning object in natural science experiment in a virtual world while providing supporting multi-modal communication abilities. The IPA has features of text chat based on the Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML), a text-to-speech synthesis function, and non-verbal communication abilities through gesture animation. The implementation is presented through explained scenarios of the IPA tutoring an experiment or monitoring a learner avatar interaction with a learning object in a Virtual World. The IPA & the learning scenarios are implemented in the open source of Open Wonderland. © 2013 IEEE.","Intelligent Agents; Intelligent Pedagogical Agents; Virtual Worlds","Artificial intelligence mark up languages; Intelligent pedagogical agents; Multimodal communications; Non-verbal communications; Prototype implementations; Science experiments; Virtual worlds; Visual collaborations; Animation; Artificial intelligence; Communication; Engineering education; Experiments; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Markup languages; Natural sciences; Speech synthesis; Teaching; Virtual reality; Intelligent agents","Guetl, C., The support of virtual 3D worlds for enhancing collaboration in learning settings (2011) Techniques for Fostering Collaboration in Online Learning Communities: Theoretical and Practical Perspectives, , F.

The final examination, immediately after studying the complex numbers unit, showed a small, but not significant gap between the two groups, with the experimental group's grades slightly higher than the control group. In a test given four months later, this gap widened to about 16 points on average for the experimental group - a significant difference. This difference can be attributed to the contribution of the laboratory experiments that required the experimental group members to engage in active learning, thereby heightening their knowledge construction. The students' allocation to the control and experimental groups was at random. © 2013 IEEE.","active learning; constructivism; enhancing learning; stem","Academic achievements; Active Learning; constructivism; enhancing learning; Knowledge construction; Laboratory experiments; Significant differences; stem; Engineering education; Experiments; Students; Human computer interaction","(2012) President Obama Announces Plans for a New, National Corps to Recognize and Reward Leading Educators in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, , http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/17/ president-obama-announces-plans-new-national-corps-recognize-and-reward, The White House - Office of the Press Secretary 17 July; (2008) STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania, Report of a Project to Identify the Missing Components, , http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf, Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach at Carnegie Mellon University, The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education; Archer, L., Osborne, J., DeWitt, J., (2012) Ten Science Facts & Fictions: The Case for Early Education About STEM Careers, , London: The Science Council; Johann Pestalozzi (1746-1827) - Career and Development of Educational Theory, Diffusion of Educational Ideas, , http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2319/Pestalozzi-Johann-1746- 1827.html, 2011, December 25; Dewey, J., (1938) Experience and Education, , New York: Simon and Schuster; Felder, R.M., Brent, R., Active learning: An introduction (2009) ASQ Higher Education Brief, 2 (4). , August; Ford, M.J., Critique in academic disciplines and active learning of academic content (2010) Cambridge Journal of Education, 40 (3), pp. 265-280; Von Glasersfeld, E., A constructivist approach to teaching (1995) Constructivism in Education, pp. 3-16. , L.

Besides the consolidation of acquired theoretical knowledge, the tool allows its users to apply three error patterns geometry to the signals and test minimum dimension and maximum dimension signal reconstruction algorithms. In the specific case of minimum dimension problems it can be solved using different solvers, iterative and direct linear equations methods. The developed tool allows the problem conditioning analysis through the spectral radius of the system matrix, the condition number and others parameters available in some specific methods. This feature gives the possibility to alter the problem definitions to the desired goal before the reconstruction begins and to choose the optimal method, depending on each problem constraints The time unit that measures the algorithms performance is expressed in terms of one Fourier Transform (FFT) calculation time. In this way the data is presented not in an absolute way but in a relative measure independent from the machine's architecture. © 2013 IEEE.","Condition Number; Educational Tool; Fast Fourier Transform (FFT); Interpolation; Over-sampling; Problem Conditioning; Signal Reconstruction; Spectral Radius","Condition numbers; Conditioning analysis; Educational tools; Over sampling; Problem constraints; Problem definition; Reconstruction algorithms; Spectral radii; Algorithms; Engineering education; Fast Fourier transforms; Interpolation; Matrix algebra; Number theory; Signal analysis; Signal reconstruction; Tools; Iterative methods","Costa, M.I., Barroso, J., Soares, S., Signal processing interpolation educational workbench (2012) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, Wiley InterScience, 20 (2), pp. 356-363. , June (DOI 10.1002/cae.20402); Golub, G., Van Loan, C., (1996) Matrix Computations, 3. , Johns Hopkins Univ Pr, 3rd. ed; Kincaid, D., Cheney, W., (2002) Numerical Analysis: Mathematics of Scientific Computing, Third Edition, , The Brooks/Cole - Thompson Learning, 3rd edition ed; Ferreira, P.J.S.G., Interpolation and the discrete papoulis-gerchberg algorithm (1994) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42 (10), pp. 2596-2606; Ferreira, P.J.S.G., Noniterative and fast iterative methods for interpolation and extrapolation (1994) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42 (11), pp. 3278-3282. , 1053-587X; http://www.mathworks.com/; Minium, E.W., King, B.M., Bear, G., (1993) Statistical Reasoning in Psychology and Education, , New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Cohen, L., Manion, L., Morrison, K., (2000) Research Methods in Education, , Londres: RoutledgeFalmer; Papoulis, A., A new algorithm in spectral analysis and band-limited extrapolation (1975) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, 22 (9), pp. 735-742; Jones, M.C., The discrete gerchberg algorithm (1986) IEEE Transactions on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing, 3 (3), pp. 624-626; Neves, F., Soares, S., Reis, M.C., Tavares, F., Assunção, P., VoIP reconstruction under a minimum interpolation algorithm (2008) IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics, , ISCE; Ferreira, P.J.S.G., The stability of a procedure for the recovery of lost samples in band-limited signals (1994) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42 (11), pp. 3278-3282. , 1053-587X; Reis, M.J.C.S., Ferreira Paulo, J.S.G., Signal and image reconstruction in undergraduate education: Tools for assessing and comparing a set of algorithms (2004) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 12 (4), pp. 242-248. , (doi: 10.1002/cae.20021); Ferreira, P.J.S.G., New algorithms for band-limited inerpolation and extrapolation: A synthetic view (2000) Proceedings EUSIPCO-2000, , Tampere, Finland; Karthik, M., Prabhu, K., On the eigenvalues of matrices for the reconstruction of missing uniform samples (2010) IEEE Trans.

Their adoption in research university classrooms has been very slow. This paper postulates a contributing factor to the lack of widespread adoption of CRS in that context and introduces a new CRS designed to mitigate the identified factor. The CRS, NetClick, is built on the premise that the requirement of authoring new content prevents many Professors from using existing CRS. After describing the operation and advantages of NetClick to other CRS, we describe initial feedback from Computer Science Professors on its use for converting existing teaching slides into interactive content. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Classroom response systems; Contributing factor; Higher education; Initial feedback; Interactive contents; Learning outcome; Research universities; Science and engineering; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Engineering education","Prince, M., Does active learning work?

To facilitate ebbs and flows of maintaining a mobile global workforce, the literature suggests that engineering education should promote methodology and learning mechanisms that personalize accountability of mobile learners' content knowledge across jurisdictions. In addition, data from the literature shows that mobile or cyber-learning is generating massive amounts of data which could inform engineering educators in their response to a mobile and constantly changing workforce. This paper reviews data from a pilot study of Technology-Enhanced Autonomous Learning Environment (TEALE). TEALE is a framework for mobile learning environments that afford accountability of personalized evidence-based content across learning jurisdictions. Prelimary data from this third pilot report suggests that TEALE promotes accountability of content knowledge across learning jurisdictions: both among formal disciplines in the academy, as well as between the academy, informal learning and workplace requirements. However, the data also suggests that seamless mobility across these academic and social jurisdictions involves issues far beyond technology. These issues, which include adjudicating relevance and value among academic cultures, incentives for motivation, authority and autonomy should be accounted for when using TEALE. Attention to these issues could prevent engineering educators from viewing potential opportunities for inter-jurisdictional collaborations as encroachments and avert the specter of unintended social-dramas. © 2013 IEEE.","Autonomous Learning; formal learning; Informal learning; LAO; Leaner Agent; learning algorithms; Portfolio; TEALE; Technology-Enhanced","Autonomous learning; Formal learning; Informal learning; LAO; Portfolio; TEALE; Technology-Enhanced; Computer aided instruction; Learning algorithms; Engineering education","(2012) Achieving Excellence in Engineering Education: The Ingredients of Successful Change, , The Royal Academy of Engineering London: The Royal Academy of Engineering; Graham, R., The road to lasting systemic change in engineering education (2012) Journal of Engineering Education, 101 (4), pp. 596-600. , The One Less Traveled By; Ahmad Abuaisheh, A., Grant, L., Successful integration of informal learning in engineering education (2012) International Journal of Advanced Corporate Learning (iJAC), 5 (2), pp. 4-9; Engel, R., Giddens, D., From our reading list to yours: A summary of key reports (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (2), pp. 220-224; What campus leaders need to know about MOOCs (2012) EDUCAUSE Is a Nonprofit Association Whose Mission Is to Advance Higher Education Through the use of Information Technology, , http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/PUB4005.pdf, Retrieved 2 December 2012; Peercy, P., Cramer, S., Redefining quality in engineering through hybred instruction (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (4), pp. 625-629; Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A.W., Feder, M.A., (2009) Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits, , Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; Fenichel, M., Schweingruber, H.A., (2010) Surrounded by Science: Learning Science in Informal Environments, , National Research Council Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; Shouse, A.W., Lewenstein, B., Feder, M.A., Bell, P., Crafting museum experiences in light of research on learning: Implications of the National Research Council's report on informal science education (2010) Curator, 53 (2), pp. 137-153; Mote, C.D., Strategic issues facing public public universities (2011) The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Annual Meeting, , Paper presented at Washington, DC; Sellen, A., Harper, R., (2003) The Myth of the Paperless Office, , MIT.

This allows for high quality elements in the portfolio and promotes the students' reflection over them before full integration. The system also complies with the existing standards for e-portfolios. Moreover, it adds an extension to integrate previous created portfolios from different educational levels. In the article we show the need for such extension and describe how the system deals with integration of such diverse portfolios into a single one. © 2013 IEEE.","Digital Portfolio; e-Portfolio; Interfolio; Interoperability; Migration; Standards","Digital portfolios; E-portfolios; Educational levels; High quality; Interfolio; Migration; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Interoperability; Standards; Engineering education","Lorenzo, G., Ittelson, J., http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI3001.pdf, [Retrieved February, 5, 2012]; Barrett, H.C., (2005) The Research on Portfolios in Education, , http://electronicportfolios.org/ALI/research.html, [Retrieved March, 15, 2012]; Edgerton, R., Hutchings, P., Quinlan, K., The teaching portfolio: Capturing the scholarship in teaching (1991) American Association for Higher Education, , Washington, DC; Seldin, P., (2007) The Teaching Portfolio: A Practical Guide to Improved Performance and Promotion/Tenure Decisions, , 3rd Edition.

The purpose of the experiment is to give the students opportunity to understand the concept of active vibration control while working on complex dynamic problems including analytical modeling, data based modeling, model reduction, model validation, and closed-loop control. The piezoelectric patch actuators bonded to the beam surface give the students opportunity to design different control algorithms and test their efficiency. Some results concerning experimental modeling, model reduction and controller design are presented in the paper. The complexity of the system, unifying different engineering areas, requires multidisciplinary knowledge from the students to develop active vibration control concepts.

This report describes a set of projects co-designed by teachers and education specialists aimed at engaging students intellectually in each major high school subject area. Student use of mobile technologies, in this case the iPad2, features prominently in each of these projects. Interviews with teachers and students were conducted in order to identify evidence of intellectual engagement, as well as students' interactions with the mobile device.

However, recording and post-processing daily lectures still demands much human effort and financial resources. Our goal is to develop a cost-effective and labor-saving video processing system that can record lectures in high-definition and process them for additional analysis and publishing. Our main idea is that high-definition recording itself is labor-saving. A stationary high-definition camcorder can record a lecturer and an entire classroom clearly so that notes can be read on a whiteboard and projector screen. Therefore, no camera operator is necessary during recording. We succeeded in implementing a cost-effective system without expensive hardware components for capturing a high-definition video signal. In this contribution, we describe the design and operational results of our system, which has recorded about 20 lectures every school week since 2010. © 2013 IEEE.","high-definition video; lecture capture; virtual camerawork","Expensive hardware; Financial resources; High-definition video signals; High-definition videos; Lecture capture; Lecture recording; Video processing; virtual camerawork; Cost effectiveness; Engineering education; Teaching; Video signal processing; Cost benefit analysis","Gosper, M., (2008) The Impact of Web-Based Lecture Technologies on Current and Future Practices in Learning and Teaching, , https://www.mq.edu.au/ltc/altc/wblt/research/report.html; Settle, A., Dettori, L., Davidson, M.J., Does lecture capture make a difference for students in traditional classrooms (2011) Proc. of the 16th Annu.

Federations of remote laboratories have existed for years: students of one university transparently access laboratories of other university through software systems that enable these contracts. However, traditionally these contracts have been defined in a 'one to one' basis and both universities using the same remote laboratory management system. The focus of this contribution is to present different interoperable bridges among different remote laboratory systems and explore how they can be chained to build complex ecosystems of remote laboratories. The impact of this chaining is that, if successful, it would definitely contribute to the adoption of remote laboratories. © 2013 IEEE.","federation; interoperability; remote laboratories","Complex ecosystems; federation; Remote laboratories; Remote laboratory systems; Software and hardwares; Software systems; Ecosystems; Engineering education; Interoperability; Laboratories","Shor, M.H., Bohus, C., Atkan, B., (2011) Second Best to Being There: A Historical Perspective.

The educational setting where we aim to profit from these experiences are software engineering courses. The usefulness of improvisational theater in different contexts was discussed in the literature during the last few years. We conducted two sessions of improvisational theater with two objectives: (a) enhancing creativity and (b) enabling the process of team building. This paper describes our motivation, the goals, the educational setting and the different improv exercises performed. Results of our evaluation indicate that the majority of students enjoyed the improv sessions. Exercises focused on team building gained better results than those focusing on creativity. Our overall impression was that the success of using improv depends on careful planning and performance on the one hand and on the students' individual comfort zone on the other hand. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer Science Education; Educational Activities; Improvisational Theater; Software Engineering Education; Student Activities; Team-work","Comfort zone; Computer Science Education; Educational activities; Educational settings; Software engineering course; Teaching activities; Team building; Team work; Engineering education; Software engineering; Students; Theaters","Amador, J.A., Miles, L., Peters, C.B., (2006) The Practice of Problem-Based Learning: A Guide to Implementing PBL in the College Classroom, , Anker Publishing, Bolton, MA, USA; Austin, R., Devin, L., (2003) Artful Making: What Managers Need to Know About How Artists Work, , FT Press, first edition; Biehl-Missal, B., (2011) Wirtschaftsästhetik - Wie Unternehmen die Kunst Als Inspiration und Werkzeug Nutzen, , (in German).

We propose a SOA architecture of a cloud hosted e-Assessment system which uses scalability and elasticity in order to achieve sustainable performance. Our solution consists of three subsystems, the first for management, the second for reports, and the third for on-demand activities during the assessments. It reduces the overall costs since it uses minimum resources utilized only during the e-Assessment. Better performance is expected to be achieved since the active subsystem for each assessment works with much smaller data compared to the centralized one. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; eAssessment; Load Balancing; Performance","Better performance; E assessments; On demands; Overall costs; Performance; Scalability and performance; SOA architecture; Sustainable performance; Cloud computing; Data privacy; Elasticity; Engineering education; Resource allocation; Scalability","Blinco, K., Mason, J., McLean, N., Wilson, S., Trends and issues in e-learning infrastructure development (2004) Altilab04, Redwood City, , California, USA; Dagger, D., O'Connor, A., Lawless, S., Walsh, E., Wade, V., Service-oriented e-learning platforms: From monolithic systems to flexible services (2007) Internet Computing, 11 (3), pp. 28-35. , IEEE; Armenski, G., Gusev, M., E-testing based on service oriented architecture (2006) 10th CAA International Computer Assisted Assessment Conference.

FLEx provides student-focused, competence-oriented and research-based learning. Conducting FLExperiments means that students solve small technical problems by experimentation and subsequently document their findings in a scientific report.

This is especially true for teenagers between 15 and 18 years old, one of the population groups that shares more information online, but also the most unaware of the risks associated with this activity. For this reason, many institutions have developed programs to educate the students in the correct use of the new communication mediums. However, the concepts about information security require a lot of expert knowledge and are very difficult to explain appropriately.

Translation of phrases is not something that is always logical and needs to be learned by the translator, interpreter or language student. Language specialists rather use the term equivalent phrase than translated phrase. Since the suitable software would be very helpful in language learning and assisting translation we developed a web application for phrase translation. During the analysis we prepared a detailed specification and discrepancies. Languages are not equally strong in phrases and suitable translation of one phrase can give one or more phrases depending on the context. The proper data structure and search logic to find the suitable phrases is therefore needed. The design of the application is customizable for different users' categories and supports multiple languages. Smart search is implemented using word and lemma keywords and works on all languages simultaneously. But the background of the smart search is much more complex than we thought at the beginning. Implemented search statistics provide an insight into language specifics of phrase translation. Authenticated users usually provide better insight but even anonymous users can be classified depending on languages hits and give some results. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computer support; Customizable; Language learning; Multiple languages; Phrase translations; Translation services; WEB application; Authentication; Engineering education; Translation (languages)","Westfall, E.R., Machine translation and the information soup (1998) Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 1529, pp. 501-505; Jesenšek, V., (2008), http://www.sprichwort-plattform.org; Jesenšek, V., Muhr, R., Helic, D., Borgulya, A., Durco, P., (2004), http://www.ephras.org; Bergenholtz, H., Bothma, T., Gouws, R., A model for integrated dictionaries of fixed expressions (2011) ELex, pp. 34-42. , Bled, Slovenia; Begenholtz, H., (2011) Needs-Adapted Data Access and Data Presentation, Pedro a Fuertes-Olivera and Henning Bergenholtz, , Eds.

This conference contribution reports on curriculum and course design and delivery experiences made within the Bachelor of Science (Information Systems Management) degree program (BSc (ISM)) offered by the School of Information Systems (SIS) at the Singapore Management University (SMU). In particular, this paper focuses on the ongoing efforts to actively link program educational objectives, program level learning outcomes and course level competencies to the actual course design and delivery. Using a large third year core course of the BSc (ISM) program (called Enterprise Web Solutions course) as an example, this paper shows how the learning outcomes defined at the program level enable the cross-course alignment within the program, how the course level competencies support the inner-course content alignment, assessment component design and feedback delivery, and how the actual course delivery process enforces changes in course competencies and even changes in the program level learning outcomes. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Bachelor of science; Component design; Course delivery; Degree program; Enterprise webs; Information systems programs; Learning outcome; Program educational objectives; Alignment; Design; Engineering education; Information systems; Curricula","Malan, S.P.T., The 'new paradigm' of outcomes-based education in perspective (2000) Journal of Family Ecology and Consumer Sciences, p. 28; Killen, R., (2007) Teaching Strategies for Outcomes-Based Education, , 2 ed.

The main concern of the described hands-on miniLABs initiative (as a work in progress) is lowering the hurdles in order to provide engineering students with an informal and straightforward access to experiments carried out in labs of the IUL at TU Dortmund University. miniLABs will offer students different, short and voluntary hands-on lab sessions, consisting of two different modes and different aspects related to manufacturing technology in the field of forming processes. In small teams, students can get in touch with practical engineering activities in the fields of present scientific research, either to study a certain phenomenon or to look at a wider engineering context. Based on the framework of experiential learning, miniLABs tries to foster the shift from teaching to deep learning.

In Tokyo University of Technology, role-play training has been carried out as a part of project management education. We have been developing an on-line group work training system named PROMASTER (Project Management Skills Training Environment) which can gather the behavior records of each learner to realize PBE (Profile Based Education). Also we have developed a software agent system, named BONAMI (agent system Based ON Aggregated Mentoring and expert Intelligence for project management), which plays the role of an adviser, and monitors the behavior of each learner, when necessary encouraging a learner to take the action. However BONAMI cannot suggest that a learner takes the proper procedures in a timely manner. In this paper, we propose an instruction method for providing advice or a hint in a timely manner. The proposed method is based on the principle that 'the correct solution should be derived through the correct orderly manner'. In particular, the method is to extract the conversation patterns from the chat messages and then to compare them to model patterns. According to the result of analyzing the actual conversation patterns, the learners' acquired skill level was found to be positively correlated with the degree of the desirable patterns. This result suggests that the degree of desirable patterns might correspond to the correct orderly approach. Consequently the proposed method encourages learners to discuss in an orderly correct manner to arrive at a correct solution. © 2013 IEEE.","Conversation model; Conversation transition patterns; Project management skill; Role-play training; Rubrics","Information technology industry; Instruction methods; Project management education; Project management skills; Role play; Rubrics; Training Systems; Transition patterns; Engineering education; Information technology; Learning systems; Management science; Project management","(2006) 1st Report of the Cultivation of Advanced ICT Human Resources Promotion Committee of 11th April, , http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/koutou/it/shiryo/06041212.html, The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (in Japanese); Martínez Mateo, J., Pérez Del Rey, D., Muñoz Hernández, S., Student Motivation and Cross-Curricular Development through e-Learning applied to Cooperation Proceedings of the 1st the Annual IEEE EDUCON Conferences (EDUCON2010); Gil, M., Fernández, M.J., Cussó, R., Crusafon, C., Real Projects to involve undergraduate students in CS degrees Proceedings of the 1st the Annual IEEE EDUCON Conferences (EDUCON2010); Nakamura, T., Mikami, A., Noguchi, T., Maruyama, H., Takashima, A., An Approach to Project Management Education Based on Providing a Role-Play Environment (2010) Proc.

This platform serves the growing needs of expanding technical curriculum into internet-based engineering courses and allows deploying, hosting and sharing laboratory resources between people all over the world. It frees laboratory owners from many responsibilities (such as creating and managing time reservation system, keeping the trusted certificate, etc.) and gives more time and freedom to concentrate on subject specific tasks rather than on computer science. On-line laboratories hosted on Labicom are normally accessible worldwide from modern web-browsers in many languages. Laboratory owners have an opportunity to localize their labs to as many languages as they want. Labicom.net represents multi-tier distributed server-client net of applications. Currently only a few laboratories are connected (Remote Laser Laboratory (RLL) [2], [3] is the most mature) but they are already used in beta-testing. New features and updates are applied regularly and new labs are supposed to join the platform soon. © 2013 IEEE.","client-server software architecture; distant and blended learning; engineering education; on-line laboratories; remote experimentation; remote laboratories; virtual laboratories; web-applications","Blended learning; Client-server software; Online laboratory; Remote experimentation; Remote laboratories; Virtual laboratories; web-applications; Curricula; Engineering education; Reservation systems; Laboratories","www.labicom.net; Titov, I., Smirnova, O., Glotov, A., Golovin, A., Remote laser laboratory: First demonstration (worldwide substitution for laser engineering lab) (2012) International Journal of On-line Engineering (IJOE), 8 (1), pp. 10-11. , February http://dx.doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v8iS1.1891).

All engineering educators throughout the world must focus on this outcome. It is difficult, however, to measure students' ability to engage in lifelong learning. In this work, the use of two short surveys designed to measure students' propensity for lifelong learning is investigated with engineering students at universities in China and the United States. Overall, engineering students in China and the U.S. self-reported a propensity for lifelong learning on both surveys. Several comparisons were done including 1) sophomores, 2) electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering sophomores and juniors, and 3) Asian American students compared to Chinese. Interestingly, contrary to popular stereotypes of Chinese students as rigid rote learners, the Chinese students reported higher use of adaptable learning strategies including comfort with open-ended problems and uncertainty compared with the American students. © 2013 IEEE.","China; engineering students; lifelong learning; U.S.","China; Chinese students; Engineering educators; Learning strategy; Life long learning; Open-ended problems; U.S; Biomedical engineering; Engineering; Students; Surveys; Engineering education","Faure, E., (1972) Learning to Be: The World of Education Today and Tomorrow, , UNESCO, Paris; Delors, J., (1996) Learning: The Treasure from Within, , UNESCO, Paris; Knapper, C., Cropley, A.J., (1985) Lifelong Learning in Higher Education, , Kogan Page, Routledge, London; (2007) Lifelong Learning and Human Capital, , http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/50/38982210.pdf, Policy Brief, July Accessed 12 July 2011; (1995) Engineering Education: Designing an Adaptive System, , National Research Council's Board on Engineering Education National Academy Press, Washington, D.C; Clough, G., (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , National Academy Press, Washington, D.C; Kabo, J., Tang, S., Nieusma, D., Currie, J., Hu, W., Baillie, C., Visions of social competence: Comparing engineering education accreditation in Australia, China, Sweden, and the United States (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ASEE Annual Conference, , San Antonio, TX, June; Kirby, J.R., Knapper, C., Lamon, P., Egnatoff, W.J., Development of a scale to measure lifelong learning (2010) International Journal of Lifelong Education, 29 (3), pp. 291-302; Macaskill, A., Taylor, E., The development of a brief measure of learner autonomy in university students (2010) Studies in Higher Education, 35 (3), pp. 351-359; Chen, J.C., McGaughey, K., Lord, S.M., Measuring students' propensity for lifelong learning (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 AAEE Conference, , Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, December; Kember, D., Misconceptions about the learning approaches, motivation and study practices of Asian students (2000) Higher Education, 40, pp. 99-121","Engineering, , San Diego, CA, United States",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Recently finished research projects - e.g. like the PeTEX project done by universities in Dortmund (Germany), Palermo (Italy) and Stockholm (Sweden) - implemented an opportunity to do experiential learning by using real laboratory equipment without being physically in the laboratory but having access via the internet. A question in this context is, how students can document their learning process and show to others (teachers and/or other students), what they have been doing. Making the whole environment available for mobile devices so that students have access from virtually everywhere and every time is the consequent further development. With this work in progress paper we show what kind of role e-portfolios can play in the learning process and which kind of scenarios are possible using the software on mobile devices. Furthermore, we show that the combination of experiential learning and the use of e-portfolios offer a great potential to promote the learners' creativity. This unique combination of topics is realized within one subtask of the project 'ELLI - Excellent Teaching and Learning in Engineering Education' at TU Dortmund University. © 2013 IEEE.","e-portfolios; engineering education; mobile learning; remote laboratories; tele-operated laboratories","E-portfolios; Experiential learning; Laboratory equipments; Mobile Learning; Remote laboratories; Teaching and learning; Tele-operated laboratories; Work in progress; Engineering education; Learning systems; Mobile devices; Research; Students; Laboratories","Bruchmüller, H.G., Haug, A., Labordidaktik für Hochschulen - Eine Einführung zum Praxisorientierten Projekt-Labor (2001) Alsbach, , LeuchtturmVerlag, Schriftenreihe report - Band 40; Kolb, D.A., (1984) Experiential Learning.

As a pioneering project, two Electrical Engineering Students are developing and building an amateur radio transmitter together with a Business Administration Student who develops the marketing and publication concept for this product. © 2013 IEEE.","Communication engineering education; Educational technology; Ham radio; Marketing management; Radio transmitter","Business administration; Communication engineering educations; Electrical engineering students; Interdisciplinary student projects; Marketing aspects; Marketing management; Short wave transmitters; Student project; Commerce; Educational technology; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Marketing; Radio transmitters; Students","Blackwell, A.F., Radical innovation: Crossing knowledge boundaries with interdisciplinary teams (2009) Technical Report Number 760, , University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, UCAM-CL-TR-760, ISSN 1476-2086; (2012) The International Amateur Radio Union, , http://www.iaru.org, October 19 Web; Fuhrmann, T., Graf, F., Project oriented digital engineering course for activating students (2012) 2nd International Engineering Education Conference, , Antalya; Auer, M.E., Zutin, D., New pedagogic challenges in engineering education (2012) 42nd ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 1012-1015. , Seattle; (2012) Gantt Project: Free Desktop Project Management Tool, , http://www.ganttproject.biz, November 29; Kotler, P., Keller, K.L., Bliemel, F., (2007) Marketing-Management, , Addison-Wesley; (2012) Projekt 2007: Monoband Allmode Transceiver, , http://www.qrpproject.de/HoboEntwicklung.html, November 29; (2012) DER SOLF, , http://www.qrpproject.de/Solf2009.html, November 29; (1959) Single Side Band Fundamentals, , http://collinsradio.org/archives/ssb_fundamentals/ Fundamentals%20of%20Single%20Side%20Band-one-file.pdf, September 1; Hayward, W., Campbell, R., Larkin, B., (2003) Experimental Methods in RF Design, the American Radio Relay League; (1996) Balances Modulators/Demodulators, Data Sheet, , Motorola, MC 1496, B Motorola Inc","University of Applied Sciences Regensburg, Seybothstraße 2, 93053 Regensburg, Germany",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

WSNs consist of sensor nodes which measure physical quantities of their environment, preprocess the measured data, and transmit it towards a base station in a multi-hop manner. WSNs are typically used in application areas without wired infrastructure and so they must be powered by batteries or energy harvesting systems. Due to the influence of different factors on the behavior, practical exercises can enhance the learning process because the students can perform their experimentation independently. This work presents the use of a remote lab for teaching energy harvesting enhanced WSNs. Students can learn the behavior of WSNs and the influences of energy harvesting. Furthermore, practical aspects of WSNs are shown by using a realistic application scenario.

Whereas assessment can give summative feedback about the proficiency of the learning, learning analytics can give a much finer level of feedback about the learning process. Learning analytics can help in identifying the effectiveness of learning elements, can help in engaging students, can guide teachers in the preparation and deployment of the teaching activity.

Computers and computer-related devices have the potential to help these children in education, career development, and independent living. However, most of the software, games, and web sites that MID and MLD children interact with are designed without consideration of their special needs, making the applications less effective or completely inaccessible. This paper introduces an edutainment system specifically designed to help these children have an enhanced and enjoyable learning process, while addresses the need for integrating physical activity into their daily lives. The proposed system consists of a padded floor mat that includes sixteen square tiles supported by sensors, which are used to interact with a number of software games specifically designed to suit the mental needs of children with ID. The system aims for enhancing both MID and MLD children learning capabilities, understanding, communications, thinking, memorization, and obesity problems. © 2013 IEEE.","Accessibility; Computer Technology; Disability; Edutainment; Learning; MID; MLD","Accessibility; Computer technology; Disability; Edutainment; Learning; MID; MLD; Application programs; Employment; Engineering education","Dawe, M., Desperately seeking simplicity: How young adults with cognitive disabilities and their families adopt assistive technologies (2006) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), pp. 1143-1152; Mohamed, O., Courboulay, V., Sehaba, K., Menard, M., Attention analysis in interactive software for children with autism (2006) Proceedings of the ASSETS Conference, pp. 133-140; (2009), http://www.disabled-world.com; (2008) Annual Statistical Abstract, , www.qsa.gov.qa; Central authority for public mobilization and statistics (2002) Country Profile on Disability Arab Republic of Egypt; (2008), http://ksu.edu.sa/sites/KSUArabic/Students/FemaleStds/OleshahCenter/ Disability/a79aeat/Pages/default.aspx; McGuire, B.E., Daly, P., Smyth, F., Lifestyle and health behaviours of adults with an intellectual disability (2007) Journal of Intellectual Disability Research, 51, pp. 497-510; Global health risks (2009) Mortality and Burden of Disease Attributable to Selected Major Risks, , World Health Organization World Health Organization.

Thus, students are enabled to develop applications without the corresponding hardware at a place and time of their choice. Targeted hardware platforms range from Atmel microcontrollers to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and common Android smartphones. The laboratory, developed by the KOMINA project, represents the application area for our approach. It is accompanied by theoretical didactic research which focuses on higher education, too.

More specifically, through IL the authors aim to eliminate the fragmentation and the learning of isolated skills for two distinct undergraduate courses (MGT-372 Management of Innovation and Technology and MIS-151 Business Software Applications) allowing students through the use of technology (Google Apps) to increase their motivation for learning as well as develop abilities towards recognizing particularities, thinking critically, tolerating uncertainty, recognizing and appreciating ethical concerns. To address the above, the study employed a case study approach, collecting qualitative data through focus groups with students, online/in-class observations and lecturers comments. © 2013 IEEE.","Google Applications; Higher education; Interdisciplinary Learning","Case study approach; Cloud environments; Higher education; Interdisciplinary learning; Management of innovation and technology; Motivation for learning; Undergraduate Courses; Web based learning; Application programs; E-learning; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Computer aided instruction","Repko, A.F., Assessing interdisciplinary learning outcomes (2009) Working Paper, School of Urban and Public Affairs, , University of Texas at Arlington; Kavaloski, V., Interdisciplinary education and humanistic aspiration: A critical reflection (1979) Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education, , Joseph Kockelmans ed.

This paper focuses on helping Computing and Technology (C&T) students improve their argument analysis and construction skills. At the heart of the current approach sits the use of a diagram-based technique for scaffolding argument analysis and construction. The technique, known as argument mapping, has been pioneered in Philosophy degrees. We discuss the specific challenges posed by using this technique in the context of distance learning for C&T students of a large (>1000 students) entry-level gateway module. Our approach includes innovative interactive computer-based formative assessment of argument mapping. After describing the approach, we evaluate it in terms of data from formative and summative assessment, detailed analysis of student work, and feedback from both students and module tutors. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer science education; Continuing education; Education; Educational technology","Argument mappings; Computer Science Education; Construction skills; Continuing education; Critical thinking skills; Formative and summative assessments; Formative assessment; University education; Distance education; Education; Educational technology; Engineering education; Feedback; Scaffolds; Students","Richards, M., Woodthorpe, J., Introducing TU100 'My Digital Life': Ubiquitous computing in a distance learning environment (2009) Proc.

In such conditions, transition from traditional teacher-centered models, focusing on curricula description and content plans, to student-centered models, in which learning activities are supported in e-learning platforms, is a necessary but difficult task to resolve. An issue that becomes especially important when the knowledge is emergent, i.e. when the activities that this knowledge enables are intensively supported by information and communication technologies, subjected to rapid obsolescence. This paper presents a method for mapping a course content plan into technological mediating tools that form a portfolio in an e-learning platform. The characteristics of the portfolio facilitate the mapping of the content plan to a student-centered learning dynamics. Details on the instructional model are provided; the reasons for implementing a green field e-learning platform are justified; an outline of the results obtained in a post-graduate course discipline of 293 students is reported, with significant results, particularly with regard to team-building skills, student satisfaction and training model. © 2013 IEEE.","collaborative learning; e-learning; electronic marketing; emergent knowledge; instructional models; mediating tools; practice fields; puzzles; simulation","Collaborative learning; Electronic marketing; emergent knowledge; Instructional model; Practice fields; puzzles; simulation; Computer simulation; Curricula; E-learning; Engineering education; Information technology; Mapping; Obsolescence; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Tools; Education computing","Romiszowski, A., How's the E-learning baby?

This paper focuses on participation in online discussion in e-learning courses for promoting learning. Although an important theoretical aspect, an analysis of literature reveals there are few studies evaluating the personal and social aspects of online course users in a quantitative manner. This paper aims to introduce a method for diagnosing inclusion and digital proficiency and other personal aspects of the student through a case study comparing Information System, Public Relations and Engineering students at a public university in Brazil. Statistical analysis and analysis of variances (ANOVA) were used as the methodology for data analysis in order to understand existing relations between the components of the proposed method. The survey methodology was also used, in its online format, as a research instrument. The method is based on using online questionnaires that diagnose digital proficiency and time management, level of extroversion and social skills of the students. According to the sample studied, there is no strong correlation between digital proficiency and individual characteristics tied to the use of time, level of extroversion and social skills of students. The differences in course grades for some components are partly due to subject 'Introduction to Economics' being offered to freshmen in Public Relations, whereas subject 'Economics in Engineering' is offered in the final semesters of Engineering and Information Systems courses. Therefore, the difference could be more tied to the respondent's age than to the course. Information Systems students were observed to be older, with access to computers and Internet at the workplace, compared to the other students who access the Internet more often from home. This paper presents a pilot study aimed at conducting a diagnosis that permits proposing actions for information and communication technology to contribute towards student education. Three levels of digital inclusion are described as a scale to measure whether information technology increases personal performance and professional knowledge and skills. This study may be useful for other readers interested in themes related to education in engineering. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; digital inclusion; digital proficiency","Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Digital inclusion; Digital proficiencies; Education in engineerings; Individual characteristics; Information and Communication Technologies; New information and communication technologies; Professional knowledge; E-learning; Engineering education; Information systems; Public relations; Social aspects; Surveys; Teaching; Students","Nunes, C., (2011) Engenharia à Distância - Ensino de Risco, , http://www.creaba.org.br/Artigo/386/Engenharia-a-distancia-Ensino-de- risco.aspx; Kreijns, K., Measuring perceived quality of social space in distributed learning groups (2004) Computers in Human Behavior, 20 (5), pp. 607-632. , Sep ISSN 0747-5632 <<Go to ISI>://000223256300003>; Garrison, D.R., Arbaugh, J.B., Researching the community of inquiry framework: Review, issues, and future directions (2007) The Internet and Higher Education, 10 (3), pp. 157-172. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751607000358, ISSN 1096-7516; Suthers, D., Technology affordances for intersubjective meaning-making: A research agenda for CSCL (2006) International Journal of Computers Supported Collaborative Learning, 1, pp. 315-337. , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?Doi=10.1.1.70.415; Sun, P.-C., What drives a successful e-learning?

The first intake of the School of Engineering at Nazarbayev University consisted of 138 students: 88 male and 50 female. Student attendance was noted at every session during the entire academic year. Final marks for all modules and grade point averages (GPAs) of the students for the fall and spring semesters were analyzed to ascertain the influence of attendance on grades and overall performance of students. Moreover the data sets were separated by gender and also analyzed. The analysis shows that correlation coefficients of attendance data and final marks are positive for thirteen out of a total of fourteen modules. It was observed that attendance data and GPAs have better correlation in fall semester than in spring semester. Attendance vs. GPA correlation for male students is lower than for female students. The fact that there was less number of female students than male students and the same cultural background (leading to streamlined perceptions of the examined sample) should be taken into account. © 2013 IEEE.","attendance; correlation; culture; performance","Academic performance; attendance; Correlation coefficient; Cultural backgrounds; Grade point average; performance; School of engineering; Student attendances; Cell culture; Correlation methods; Students; Engineering education","Hunter, S., Tetley, J., Lectures.

Both packages are considered for teaching a mathematical topic: 'How to solve long division problem?'. They have been submitted at the fifth grade classroom level in elementary schools (as a case study with or without associated teacher's voice). Furthermore, after the application of the suggested CAL packages, practical findings have been compared with classical learning obtained results. Interestingly, all findings are shown to be in agreement with simulation results after running the introduced realistic ANN model. Finally, this work investigated well how measured mathematical teaching quality could be fairly improved via assessment of two learning parameters' performance (achievement level & response time). © 2013 IEEE.","Associative memory; Computer Assisted Learning; Long Division Process; Multimedia Learning Theory; Neural Networks Modeling","ANN modeling; Associative memory; Computer assisted learning; Elementary schools; Learning parameters; Learning rates; Multimedia learning theory; Teaching quality; Associative processing; Engineering education; Teaching; Neural networks","Balderas, A., The Influence of Information Technology in the Daily Work of Mathematics Teachers, , http://nti.educa.rcanana.es/usr/matematicas/revistas.htm, (28/12/98). balderas@sunserver.uaq.mx; Iteractive Practice with Long Division with no Decimals: Daisy Maths - Long Division, , http//Argyll.epsb.ca/jreed/extras/longdiv; Long Division: A Touch-Stone for a Few Teaching Principles, , www.math.technion.ac.il/~ra/englongdivision.doc; Mustafa, H.M., Modeling of Phonics Reading Methodology Using Neural Networks (Mathematical Formulation Approach) (2011) 2011 International Conference on E-Education, Entertainment and E-Management ICEEE, , held on 27-29 December In Jakarta, Indonesia; Hassan, H.M., Al-Saleem, S., On Artificial Neural Network Application for Modeling of Teaching Reading Using Phonics Methodology (Mathematical Approach) The 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, , published at ICEENG 2008, M.T.C. on 25-27 May, Cairo, Egypt; Hassan, H.M., On mathematical analysis, and evaluation of phonics method for teaching of reading using artificial neural network models (2005) SIMMOD, pp. 254-262. , published at Jan.l7-19; Chall, J.S., (1996) Learning to Read, the Great Debate, , Harcourt Brace; Rayner, K., Foorman, B.R., Perfetti, C.A., Pesetsky, D., Seiedenberg, M.S., How should reading be taught?

They should be able to contribute to that success criterion through their daily work. Although economic gain is a wide-spread measure of success, it cannot be fully controlled by developers or even project leaders. Inappropriate deadlines, political influences, and many other aspects are beyond the control of software engineers. A success criterion closer to the sphere of influence of software engineers could better guide decisions of students - and practicing software engineers as well. We introduce the concept of requirements compliance1, which measures the size of the intersection between stated and implemented requirements. Fulfilled requirements are considered a success. Both unfulfilled requirements and unsolicited features are considered indications of reduced success: The latter consume resources without meeting stated needs, while missing requirements ignore customer requests. In this paper, we motivate and introduce the core concept of requirements compliance. We show how it can be and has been used for different variants of software engineering education, including serious educational games. We go beyond this prior use by identifying ways of modeling, observing and controlling requirements compliance in a series of student projects. We discuss opportunities for using this concept in software engineering education - but also build on the mental model in research and in practice. © 2013 IEEE.","communication; project success; software requirements","Economic gains; Educational game; Political influences; Project leaders; Project success; Software requirements; Sphere of influences; Student project; Communication; Engineering education; Engineers; Learning systems; Project management; Software engineering; Students; Compliance control","Procaccino, J.D., Verner, J.M., Software project managers and project success: An exploratory study (2006) Journal of Systems and Software, 79 (11), pp. 1541-1551; Procaccino, J.D., Verner, J.M., Shelfer, K.M., Gefen, D., What do software practitioners really think about project success: An exploratory study (2005) Journal of Systems and Software, 78 (2), pp. 194-203; Bröhl, A.-P., Dröschel, W., (1995) The V-Model, , Oldenbourg-Verlag; Boehm, B.W., A spiral model of software development and enhancement (1988) IEEE Computer, 21 (5), pp. 61-72. , Mai; Beck, K., (2000) Extreme Programming Explained, , Addison-Wesley; Cockburn, A., (2002) Agile Software Development, , Addison Wesley; Alexander, I., Beus-Dukic, L., (2009) Discovering Requirements: How to Specify Products and Services, , Wiley; Stachowiak, H., (1973) Allgemeine Modelltheorie, , Springer Verlag; Abdel-Hamid, T., Madnick, S., (1991) Software Project Dynamics, , Prentice Hall; Rodriguez, D., Satpathy, M., Pfahl, D., Effective software project management education through simulation models.

Now only one technology sufficiently corresponds to the named requirements. It is TRIZ-pedagogic consisting in integration of studying of various disciplines and subjects with studying of Theory of Inventive Problems Solving (TRIZ). Earlier as a part of TRIZ-pedagogic there was a method of creative tasks at which studying of a new material still had reproductive character. Authors of the paper have added TRIZ-pedagogic a method of the invention of knowledge that has allowed to apply this system of innovative education at all stages of educational process.

Despite this fact, and its importance in the industry, software maintenance and supporting techniques such as reengineering are hardly ever taught in practical lessons. This paper presents a reengineering teaching experience conducted during two last years in lab sessions by using reverse engineering and code generation tools. The experience was carried out by merging traditional methods (such as teaching lessons) with a practical exercise in laboratory. The teaching-learning process was qualitative- and quantitatively assessed by comparing results between an initial and final evaluation, as well as between the experiences conducted during two last years with different syllabus of courses. In fact, the effect of the experience in both syllabi proved to be effective. The reported results show that students do not know reengineering as a software maintenance technique although their satisfaction with the experience was high or very high (62%) or medium (30%). The key learned lessons are that students recognized the usage of reengineering tools as very convenient for their performance as future practitioners and the need to devote additional time in classroom to learn such tools. © 2013 IEEE.","Evaluation; Maintenance; Practical Experience; Reengineering; Software Engineering","Code generation tools; Evaluation; Knowledge areas; Practical experience; Reengineering tools; Software reengineering; Teaching experience; Teaching-learning process; Computer software maintenance; Curricula; Engineering education; Maintenance; Reverse engineering; Software engineering; Teaching; Tools; Reengineering","Bianchi, A., Caivano, D., Marengo, V., Visaggio, G., Iterative reengineering of legacy systems (2003) IEEE Trans.

In Tokyo University of Technology, role-play training has been carried out as part of project management education. The role-play scenarios necessary to run role-play exercises have been created in accordance with the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) model. This paper describes a method for evaluating project management competency that learners gain through role-play training conducted using the scenarios. Competency in project management is assessed from a learner's behavior characteristics in taking an appropriate action when needed. We first examined the quality of the role-play scenarios by using a design checklist based on Goal-Based Scenarios (GBS). In addition, we analyzed the behavior of each learner during a role-play exercise by using rubrics based on how the user behaved. A high correlation was found between the acquired skill with which learners generally played the role assigned to them in role-play training and the level of quality of the role-play scenario. Based on the analysis results, we will propose a method for helping learners to be able to take effective action by providing appropriate advice from a software agent and feedback from a teacher, along with use of the GBS checklist. © 2013 IEEE.","ADDIE model; GBS; PMCDF; Project management; Role-play training; Rubrics","ADDIE model; GBS; PMCDF; Role play; Rubrics; Engineering education; Information technology; Project management","(2006) 1st Report of the Cultivation of Advanced ICT Human Resources Promotion Committee of 11th April, , http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/koutou/it/shiryo/06041212.html, The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (in Japanese); Dick, W., Carey, L., Carey, J.O., (2001) The Systematic Design of Instruction; (2009) Project Management Conpetency Development Framework Second Edition, , Project Management Institute (in Japanese); Burke, K., (2011) From Standards to Rubric in Six Steps; Nakamura, T., Mikami, A., Noguchi, T., Maruyama, H., Takashima, A., An Approach to Project Management Education Based on Providing a Role-Play Environment (2010) Proc. of the 5th International Conference on Project Management, pp. 862-874; Nakamura, T., Takashima, A., Sambe, Y., Role play exercises for project management education that incorporate a software agent (2012) IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering, pp. 242-247; Nemoto, J., Suzuki, K., A checklist Development for or Instructional Design Based on Goal-Based scenario Theory (2006) Japan Society for Education Technology, pp. 309-318; Arter, J.A., Mctighe, J., (2000) Scoring Rubric in the Classroom; Tachikawa, Y., Takashima, A., Maruyama, H., Nakamura, T., An Analysis of the Relation between the Behavior of a Learner and Acquired Skill Level in Role-Play Training (2012) Proc. of the 6th International Conference on Project Management, pp. 113-120; Gil, M., Fernández, M.J., Cussó, R., Crusafon, C., Real Projects to involve undergraduate students in CS degrees (2010) Proc. of the 1st the Annual IEEE EDUCON Conferences, pp. 833-838","School of Computer Science, , Tokyo, Japan",21659559,9781467361101,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

The use of laboratories is necessary for better understanding of natural laws, but also for the development of critical thinking and experimentation. However, researchers have marked that practical exercise in laboratories presents some restrictions. Distance education can be an important solution to this problem in the context of Higher Education, both for conventional Universities as well as for Institutions of Open and Distant Education. Modern computer technology and communications offer new opportunities to develop virtual and/or remote laboratories. We performed an investigation concerning published papers in scientific journals as well as papers published in proceedings of international conferences. We selected to present representative applications that present some particular interesting aspects. The accent was given in those that stress points of planning and designing the educational materials and equipment both from a technical point of view but also from a pedagogic point and which include also reports from the application of the discussed laboratories. © 2013 IEEE.","distance eduxation; enginnering sciences; higher education; physical sciences; remote labs; Virtual labs","distance eduxation; enginnering sciences; Higher education; Physical science; Remote labs; Virtual lab; Distance education; Engineering education; Laboratories","Sokoloff, D., Real time physics: Active learning in the introductory laboratory (1993) Proc.

The approach is well characterized in the context of learning natural sciences in secondary education. Less is known, however, of its characteristics in the context of higher engineering education. The purpose of this review study is to identify key characteristics of DBL in higher engineering education. From the tenets of engineering design practices and higher engineering education contexts we identified four relevant dimensions for organizing these characteristics: the project characteristics, the role of the teacher, the assessment methods, and the social context. Drawing on these four dimensions, we systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art empirical literature on DBL or DBL-like educational projects in higher engineering education. Based on this review we conclude that DBL projects consist of open-ended, hands-on, authentic and multidisciplinary design tasks resembling the community of engineering professionals. Teachers facilitate both the process of gaining domain-specific knowledge and the thinking activities relevant to propose innovative solutions. Teachers scaffold students in the development from novice to expert engineers. Assessment is characterized by formative and summative of both individual and team products and processes and by the use of a variety of assessment instruments. Finally, the social context of DBL projects includes peer-to-peer collaboration in which students work in teams. The implications of these findings for further research on DBL in higher engineering education are discussed. © 2012 The Author(s).","Authentic projects; Design-based learning; Engineering education; Scaffolding","Authentic projects; Design-based learning; Domain-specific knowledge; Engineering professionals; Higher engineering educations; Multi-disciplinary designs; Peer-to-peer collaboration; Scaffolding; Engineering education; Scaffolds; Design","Apedoe, X.A., Reynolds, B., Ellefson, M.R., Schunn, C.D., Bringing engineering design into high school science classrooms: The heating/cooling unit (2008) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 17 (5), pp. 454-465. , 10.1007/s10956-008-9114-6; Atman, C.J., Adams, R.S., Cardella, M.E., Turns, J., Mosborg, S., Saleem, J., Engineering design processes: A comparison of students and expert practitioners (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (4), pp. 359-379. , 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2007.tb00945.x; Baley, R., Assessing engineering design process knowledge (2006) International Journal Engineering Education, 22 (3), pp. 508-518; Barrows, H.S., (1985) How to Design A Problem-based Curriculum for the Preclinical Years, , Springer New York; Behrens, A., Atorf, L., Schwann, R., Neumann, B., Schnitzler, R., Ballé, J., Herold, T., Aach, T., MATLAB meets LEGO Mindstorms - A freshman introduction course into practical engineering (2010) IEEE Transactions on Education, 53 (2), pp. 306-317. , 10.1109/TE.2009.2017272; Biggs, J., (2003) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Open University Press Buckingham, UK; Black, P., Wiliam, D., Assessment and classroom learning (1998) Assessment in Education, 5 (1), pp. 7-74. , 10.1080/0969595980050102; Black, P., Wiliam, D., Developing the theory of formative assessment (2009) Educational Assessment, Evaluation and Accountability, 21 (1), pp. 5-31. , 10.1007/s11092-008-9068-5; Boekaerts, M., Self-regulated learning: A new concept embraced by researchers, policy makers, educators, teachers and students (1997) Learning and Instruction, 7 (2), pp. 161-186. , 10.1016/S0959-4752(96)00015-1; Bolhuis, S., Towards process-oriented teaching for self-directed lifelong learning: A multidimensional perspective (2003) Learning and Instruction, 13 (3), pp. 327-347. , 10.1016/S0959-4752(02)00008-7; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18 (1), pp. 32-42. , 10.3102/0013189X018001032; Chang, G.-W., Yeh, Z.-M., Pan, S.-Y., Liao, C.-C., Chang, H.-M., A progressive design approach to enhance project-based learning in applied electronics through an optoelectornic sensing project (2008) IEEE Transaction on Education, 51 (2), pp. 220-233. , 10.1109/TE.2007.907321; Cheville, R.A., McGovern, A., Bull, K.S., The light applications in science and engineering research collaborative undergraduate laboratory for teaching (LASE CULT) - Relevant experiential learning in photonics (2005) IEEE Transactions on Education, 48 (2), pp. 254-263. , 10.1109/TE.2004.842919; Chinowsky, P.S., Brown, H., Szjnman, A., Realph, A., Developing knowledge landscapes through project-based learning (2006) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 132 (2), pp. 118-124; Clyde, S.W., Crane, A.E., Design-n-code fests (2003) Computer Science Education, 13 (4), pp. 289-303. , 10.1076/csed.13.4.289.17495; Collins, A., Cognitive apprenticeship (2006) The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences, pp. 47-60. , R.K.

The professional development was organised in four phases with each phase providing themes for reflection and teacher learning in subsequent phases. On-going support, reflection and feedback underpinned the professional development processes to enhance teachers' prospects of putting aside old traditions and culture to implement new practices in their classrooms. The teachers collaboratively explored new concepts through readings of selected scholarly papers, making presentations of their views generated from the readings and engaging with peers in discussing learning, curriculum issues and concepts related to the nature of technology and technology education. A qualitative analysis of the teachers' journey through the phases of the professional development showed the teachers' enhanced knowledge of technology and technology education. However, their classroom practices showed technological pedagogical techniques that reflected their traditional strategies for teaching technical subjects. It is argued that although the teachers' conceptualisation of learning in technology was still fragile at this point, attempts to shift teachers' beliefs and practices require deep theoretical grounding and transferring that into technological practices. A professional development built on existing ideas and context helps expand the teachers' views about the nature of technology and technology education. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Pedagogical knowledge; Professional development; Technological practices; Technology education","Classroom practices; Pedagogical knowledge; Pedagogical practices; Pedagogical technique; Professional development; Qualitative analysis; Technological practices; Technology education; Curricula; Professional aspects; Teaching; Technology; Engineering education","Al-Daami, K.K., Wallace, G., Curriculum reform in a global context: A study of teachers in Jordan (2007) Journal of Curriculum Studies, 39 (3), pp. 339-360. , 10.1080/00220270601057790 10.1080/00220270601057790; Ankiewicz, P., The planning of technology education for South African schools (1995) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 5 (3), pp. 245-254. , 10.1007/BF00769906 10.1007/BF00769906; Appleton, H., Ilkkaracan, I., The technological capabilities of women and girls in developing countries (1994) Innovations in Science and Technology Education, pp. 145-157. , D.

Consequently, the creation and communication by means of graphics demand careful development of spatial skills provided by the balanced curricula based on the research results in multi disciplinary area. The approach to engineering graphics education had been transformed to meet spatial skills improvement even before significant and fast changes arose from the development of computer technology enabling the engineer powerful tools and techniques. The correlation and interference between new technologies widely introduced in engineering graphics education and spatial ability/skills, have initiated new studies to establish the basis of holistic engineering graphics education. This paper presents the overview of some efforts and possible answers resulting from intensive research into spatial ability and skills and their implementation in the conception of graphics education in engineering environment. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Curriculum; Education; Engineering graphics; Spatial ability","Computer technology; Engineering graphics; Graphics education; Human intelligence; Intensive research; Research results; Spatial abilities; Tools and techniques; Curricula; Education; Engineering; Engineering education","Angelov, A.N., Smieja, T., Styczynski, Z., New training programs in power engineering using VMRL visualization methods (2007) Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Electricity Distribution, , Vienna, Austria, CIRED2007 Session 6; Barnea, N., Teaching and learning about chemistry and modelling with a computer managed modelling system (2000) Developing Models in Science Education, , J.K.

The PTTER was developed through collaboration involving representatives from each of the six New Zealand university teacher education providers, Massey University, University of Auckland, University of Canterbury, University of Otago, Victoria University and University of Waikato, working with the National Technology Professional Development Manager. The framework for PTTER is built on four key elements considered to be essential to the education of technology teachers. The four elements are: philosophy of technology, rationale for technology education, technology in the New Zealand curriculum, and teaching technology. The PTTER is a web-based resource aimed at assisting technology teacher educators in the development of their teacher education programmes. The framework is a statement of shared philosophy, purpose and intent and is located on the Techlink website (www.techlink.org.nz). PTTER contains a range of teaching resources and strategies located within an overall framework for initial technology teacher education programmes. This paper describes the rationale for the PTTER framework, the process through which it was developed, explanation of each of the framework's elements, and concludes with discussion of the framework's implementation and future development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","New Zealand; Pre-service; Teacher education; Technology education","New zealand; Philosophy of technology; Pre-service; Professional development; Teacher education; Teaching technologies; Technology education; University of Canterbury; Curricula; Ontology; Teaching; Technology; Websites; Engineering education","Alexandra, P., The development of expertise: The journey from acclimation to proficiency (2003) Educational Researcher November, 32 (8). , http://edr.sagepub.com/content/32/8/10.full.pdf+html, Retrieved November 22, 2009; Basalla, G., (1988) The Evolution of Technology, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Bronowski, J., (1973) The Ascent of Man, , Warner Books London; Burns, J., Students' attitudes towards and concepts of technology (1990) Report to the Ministry of Education, , Wellington; Compton, V., Compton, A., Technological knowledge and the nature of technology: Implications for teaching and learning (2010) Summary and Research Findings: Stage Two, , http://www.techlink.org.nz/curriculum-support/TKNOT-Imps/page3.htm; Compton, V., France, B., Redefining technological literacy in New Zealand: From concepts to curriculum constructs (2007) Teaching and Learning Technological Literacy in the Classroom.

Technology education is ostensibly a foundation for future designers and creative thinking. However evidence of good design or creative thinking in outcomes displayed in school technology studios is limited. Technology is inextricably linked with applied science, but I argue that scientific method couldn't be further from creativity and designing as technology education based on this premise can confine problem solving to a set of prescribed components that harness teachers to narrowly defined and deeply focused goals. This paper attempts to analyse the nature of this phenomenom, debate the place of creativity, imagination and personal sensitivities as part of designing and demonstrate that although there are inseperable links between design and technology the structure of a technology curriculum could be a barrier to opportunities for effective design thinking. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Consciousness; Creativity; Critical thinking; Design; Technology","Consciousness; Creativity; Critical thinking; Design and technology; Scientific method; Technological literacy; Technology curricula; Technology education; Curricula; Design; Technology; Engineering education","Adams, P., Mylander, M., Gesundheit!: Bringing good health to you, the medical system, and society through physician service, complementary therapies, humor, and joy (1993) Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press; Anning, A., Teaching and learning how to design in schools (1997) The Journal of Design and Technology Education, 2 (1), pp. 15-30; Barlex, D., Research into creativity, in art & design and design & technology in the National Curriculum (1999) Journal of Design and Technology Education, 6 (1), pp. 29-39; Brown, T., Getting down with Mr Brown (2005) Pro-Design, 3, pp. 35-36; Brown, T., (2009) Tim Brown Urges Designers to Think Big, TED Talks, , http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_urges_designers_to_think_big.html, Retrieved 10 Sept 2010; Cross, N., Designerly ways of knowing: Design discipline versus design science (2001) Design Issues, 17 (3), pp. 49-55. , 10.1162/074793601750357196; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1990) Flow: The Psychology of of Optimal Experience, , Harper & Row New York; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (2003) Good Business; Leadership, Flow and the Making of Meaning, , Viking New York; De Bono, E., (1999) New Thinking for the New Millennium, , Penguin Books London; Edwards, B., (2001) Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, , Harper Collins London; Eisner, E.W., What can education learn from the arts about the practice of education (2004) International Journal of Education & the Arts, 5 (4), pp. 1-11; Epstein, R., Let your creativity soar (2008) Scientific American Mind, 19, pp. 24-31; Fraser, S., New Zealand Design: Is it globally competitive?

A key focus in Stage Two was the trialing of different teaching strategies to determine how learning related to the components Technological Modelling (TM), Technological Products (TP) and Technological Systems (TS) could be supported. These components fall within the Technological Knowledge (TK) strand of technology in the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) (Ministry of Education, 2007) and as such, reflect the key generic concepts or 'big ideas' of technology. During this stage of the research further exploration was also undertaken to determine how student understanding of these three components of technology education progressed from level 1 to 8 of the NZC (Ministry of Education, 2007). This resulted in a significant review of the Indicators of Progression for TM, TP and TS, providing clarification of the nature of the progression expected of students in each component as well as increased teacher guidance to support such progression. Common misconceptions, partial understandings and alternative concepts related to these components were confirmed and explained and five case studies were developed to illustrate strategies employed by teachers and their impact on student learning related to these three components. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alternative concepts; Common misconceptions; Partial understandings; Progression; Technological Knowledge; Technological Modelling; Technological Products; Technological Systems","Alternative concepts; Common misconceptions; Partial understandings; Progression; Technological knowledge; Technological Products; Technological system; Curricula; Research; Students; Technology; Engineering education","Alexander, P.A., The development of expertise: The journey from acclimation to proficiency (2003) Educational Researcher, 32 (8), pp. 10-14. , 10.3102/0013189X032008010; Alexander, P.A., The path to competence: A lifespan developmental perspective on reading (2006) Journal of Literacy Research, 37, pp. 413-436. , 10.1207/s15548430jlr3704-1; Compton, V.J., (2007) A New Technological Literacy, , http://www.techlink.org.nz/curriculum-support/literacy/index.htm, Paper provided as part of the Ministry of Education Curriculum Support Package published on Techlink; Compton, V.J., Compton, A., Technological Knowledge and the nature of technology: Establishing the nature of progression (2009) Proceedings of the Pupils' Attitudes Towards Technology (PATT 22) International Design and Technology Education Conference: Strengthening Technology in the School Curriculum, , August 24-28 2009, Delft, The Netherlands; Compton, V.J., Compton, A., Progression in the knowledge and philosophy of technology (2011) Positioning Technology Education in the Curriculum.

The project had little impact on school practice and was soon forgotten about. However, the project is interesting from several points of view. First, it elaborated an interesting curricular idea where school activities were to centre around technology, thus creating a meaningful whole for the pupils, a sort of ""language of schooling"". Second, the Glass Project illustrates a utopian logic of educational reform. The school had become an important area of reform in the mid-twentieth century, and in this the pedagogy of the ""old school"" was heavily criticised. Technology education clearly became a tool for progressive ideas in Sweden in the 1960s. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Curriculum development; General education; Progressive ideas; Sweden; Technology education","Curriculum development; General education; Progressive ideas; Sweden; Technology education; Curricula; Glass; Technology; Engineering education","National Archives (Riksarkivet), 2. , Ang revision av läroplan för grundskolan.

Scientists from different fields warn humanity that the current trajectory of capitalism is leading towards environmental and cultural decline and that urgent measures are required to deal with the current and emerging issues. Global financial and economic crises, poverty and inequality, climate change and environmental degradation reinforce our understanding that a collaborative effort is required in addressing the existing status quo through education. These changing contexts require transformative education that must play a key role in developing a planetary vision, in ""securing sustainable life chances, aspirations and futures for young people"". This paper refers to the essence of SD and the ethics behind it, explores current research on ESD in technology education (TE) and suggests a number of challenges that emerged for technology education as a result of the global SD agenda. They are related to policy and curriculum development, teaching and learning, and teacher training. This paper argues that current and future research on ESD in technology education must be framed by a shared vision about quality education and a society that lives in balance with Earth's carrying capacity. The paper concludes with suggestions for further directions for research associated with the areas of challenge. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Education for sustainable development; Policy and curriculum development; Research in technology education; Teacher training; Teaching and learning; Transformative education","Curriculum development; Education for sustainable development; Teacher training; Teaching and learning; Technology education; Climate change; Curricula; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Engineering research; Environmental protection; Personnel training; Planning; Sustainable development; Teaching; Technology; Engineering education","Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., Organizational learning II: Theory, method and practice (2004) Key Issues in Sustainable Development and Learning: A Critical Review, pp. 63-68. , W.

Blended learning is the seamless amalgamation of carefully selected online modules with face-to-face instruction. This paper evaluates case studies of the introduction of blended learning in these disciplines. It demonstrates that students who do not engage with blended learning are academically disadvantaged. Alignment of the blended mode of delivery and the mode of assessment is next considered. Two case studies of the introduction of blended modes of assessment, for improved student satisfaction with feedback, are evaluated. Finally, the reliance upon non-faculty to provide both blended learning and assessment is evaluated using qualitative research methods to establish the barriers to adoption of what is now considered best educational practice. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","architecture; assessment; blended learning; design; engineering (architectural); learning outcomes","assessment; Barriers to adoption; Blended learning; Enhance learning; Face-to-face instruction; Learning outcome; Qualitative research methods; Student satisfaction; Architecture; Design; Metals; Research; Students; Engineering education","Ang, S., Segrave, S., Larkin, H., Hitch, D., Watchhorn, V., Elkadi, H., McCracken, M., Holt, D., Enriching Student Experience and Inter-Professional Learning of Inclusive Design with Second Life (2010) In: ANZAScA 2010: On the Border: Architectural Science in Theory and Practice: Proceedings of the 44th Annual Conference of the Architectural Science Association, pp. 1-8. , Auckland: ANZAScA; Anthony, K., (1991) Design Juries on Trial: The Renaissance of the Design Studio, , New York, New York,: Van Nostrand Reinhold; Beer, C., Clark, K., Jones, D., Indicators of Engagement (2010) In Curriculum, Technology & Transformation for an Unknown Future: Proceedings ASCILITE Sydney 2010, pp. 75-86. , http://ascilite.org.au/conferences/sydney10/procs/Beer-full.pdf, edited by C.

The most probable reason, which has been mentioned in current science education research in HE, is that the level of interaction between teachers and learners in formal instructional settings is very low. In this paper, we describe changes that were introduced in lectures towards the promotion of active learning and analyse its effects in the classroom environment. The introduction of conceptual questions and peer instruction seems to motivate students in the class and help them engage in the learning process. These strategies have been used in the first year of an introductory physics course for engineering students in two different Portuguese HE institutions. The data were collected through questionnaires and student interviews. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","active learning; didactics (pedagogy) of higher education; engineering education; higher education; motivation for learning","Active Learning; Classroom environment; Conceptual questions; Higher education; Instructional settings; Motivation for learning; Science education; Student interviews; Engineering education; Motivation; Students; Surveys; Teaching","Anderson, T., Howe, C., Soden, R., Halliday, J., Low, J., Peer Interaction and the Learning of Critical Thinking Skills on Further Education Students (2001) Instrutional Science, 29 (1), pp. 1-32. , doi:10.1023/A:1026471702353; Arons, A., Physics, Epistemology, and Teaching: Generalizations to Be Drawn from Results of Research on Teaching and Learning (1995) Thinking Physics for Teaching, pp. 1-7. , In: Bernardini C., Tarsitani C., Vicentini M., editors New York, New York,: Plenum Press; Crouch, C.H., Mazur, E., Peer Instruction: Ten Years of Experience and Results (2001) American Association of Physics Teachers, 69 (9), pp. 970-977; Dufresne, R.J., Gerace, W.J., Leonard, W.J., Mestre, J., Wenk, L., Classtalk: A Classroom Communication System for Active Learning (1996) Journal of Computing in Higher Education, 7, pp. 3-47. , doi:10.1007/BF02948592; Hake, R.R., Interactive-Engagement Versus Traditional Methods: A Six-Thousand-Student Survey of Mechanics Test Data for Introductory Physics Courses (1998) American Journal of Physics, 66 (1), pp. 64-74. , doi:10.1119/1.18809; Hall, S.R., Waitz, I., Brodeur, D.R., Soderholm, D.H., Nasr, R., Adoption of Active Learning in Lecture-Based Engeneering Class Paper presented at the 32a ASEE/IEEE frontiers in education conference, Boston, MA; Halloun, I.A., Hestenes, D., The Initial Knowledge State of Students (1985) American Journal of Physics, 53 (11), pp. 1043-1055. , doi:10.1119/1.14030; Hestenes, D., Wells, M., Swackhamer, G., Force Concept Inventory (1992) The Physics Teacher, 30 (3), pp. 141-158. , doi:10.1119/1.2343497; Lopes, J.B., (2004) Aprender e Ensinar Física, , Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Braga; Mazur, E., (1997) Peer Instruction: A User's Manual, , Upper Saddle River, NJ, Upper Saddle River, NJ,: Prentice-Hall; Mazur, E., Peer Instruction: Getting Students to Think in Class The Changing Role of Physics Departments in Modern Universities, 399, pp. 981-988. , Paper presented at.

The author investigated the following questions: What are the influences behind females' decisions to choose engineering as their major course of study? What are the motives behind this decision? What are the perceptions of females regarding the essential skills for a successful engineering career? An online survey consisting of Likert-scale items was completed by 327 female engineers who graduated from universities in Lebanon and now work in various locations around the world. A genuine interest in the field appeared to be the main influence in the participants' decisions to choose engineering profession. The potential for professional growth was the leading motivator for choosing engineering. Although participants reported that they possessed adequate theoretical knowledge and technical skills before graduation, in the actual practice of engineering, they noted weaknesses in creativity and innovation. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","engineering education; Middle East; women in engineering","Engineering careers; Engineering profession; Middle East; Online surveys; Professional growth; Technical skills; Women engineers; Women in engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects","Akili, W., (2005) On industry-Academia Relations in the Arab Gulf States: Steps Toward Building Strategic Partnership, , Paper read at ASEE/IEEE frontiers in education conference, Indianapolis, October 19-22; Al-Arabiya, (2011) Jeddah to Host First Government Engineering Program for Women, , http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/21/183800.html, (December).

The approach that we present in the paper is based on a new tool that extends the features of the Digital Electronics Education and Design Suite (Deeds). The FPGA extension allows students to compile a project generated with Deeds into an FPGA chip, reducing to a minimum the interaction with the FPGA-specific CAD. The tool allows the student to associate all the inputs and outputs of the Deeds project to the devices and resources of an FPGA development board and generates all the VHDL and script files needed by the CAD to compile the project and load it on the board for testing.

Engineers are in high demand in all specializations and Qatar University (QU), Qatar's only national university, provides the country with the highest number of engineering graduates. For engineers, whose occupation allows them potential for positive or negative societal impacts, it is critical that their decisions involve sound ethical judgment, hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public, and perform services only in areas of their competence. This ethical responsibility is considered and enhanced in the teaching of ethics in their engineering curriculum. In this paper, a review of current practices in teaching ethics in engineering at QU is given. Chemical engineering selected as a case study. The aim of the study is to review current practices, identify gaps and make recommendations to the college to enhance the ethics education in the engineering curriculum at QU. © 2013 IEEE.","Chemical Engineering; Engineering Ethics; Qatar","Chemical engineering curricula; Current practices; Engineering curriculum; Engineering ethics; Engineering graduates; Ethical responsibility; Petrochemical industry; Qatar; Chemical engineering; Engineering; Engineering education; Philosophical aspects","Shuman, L.J., Sindelar, M.F., Besterfield-Sacre, M., Wolfe, H., Pinkus, R.L., Miller, R.L., Olds, B.M., Mitcham, C., Can our students recognize and resolve ethical dilemmas?

To do this, six mechanical engineering faculty were interviewed regarding their use of internet resources in their various courses, and their views on how successful or unsuccessful they were in using the internet to improve their pedagogy. A survey was then administered to junior and senior mechanical engineering students to identify their needs and to triangulate the interview findings. It was found that faculty can be grouped into three general archetypes based on their use of online resources in each of their courses: internet resisters, internet users, and internet adopters. It was also found that while professors would invariably teach each individual course as a single archetype, most would teach different courses as different archetypes, to best fit each course's requirements and content. Strengths and weaknesses of each archetype are identified, and a continuing dialog between engineering faculty and students is recommended to determine what practices will best fit the needs of the internet-savvy student population within each course. © Manchester University Press.","design management education; learning style; multi-national education","Design management; Engineering faculty; Faculty adoption; Internet resources; Learning Style; Mechanical engineering students; Online resources; Student populations; Design management; Engineering faculty; Faculty adoption; Internet resources; Learning Style; Mechanical engineering students; Multi-nationals; Student populations; Curricula; Internet; Mechanical engineering; Students; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Internet; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Teaching","Bhatt, M.M., Resources on the internet for engineering education (2006) European J.

The purpose of the module is to pull together many of the mathematical concepts in the early education of mechanical engineering students while at the same time introducing them to other important topics - an application of finite differences to the numerical approximation of partial differential equations, the importance of controlling round-off error in computational algorithms, and the time complexity of some numerical models. Students learn these topics through the execution of computer experiments. The first set of experiments cover the numerical approximation of heat conduction in a ring, and a second set cover the numerical approximation of the reaction and diffusion of chemicals that will produce the markings on an animal's tail. The learning outcomes of the module are evaluated with data from pre- and post-module surveys given to mechanical engineering students in several sections of a required course in numerical methods. © Manchester University Press.","diffusion; finite differences; partial differential equations; round-off error","Advanced engineerings; Computational algorithm; finite differences; Heat transfer course; Mathematical concepts; Mechanical engineering students; Numerical approximations; Round-off errors; Advanced engineerings; Computational algorithm; finite differences; Heat transfer course; Mathematical concepts; Mechanical engineering students; Numerical approximations; Round-off errors; Animals; Finite difference method; Mechanical engineering; Numerical methods; Partial differential equations; Students; Animals; Approximation algorithms; Differential equations; Diffusion; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Errors; Finite difference method; Heat conduction; Heat transfer; Partial differential equations; Students; Teaching; Diffusion; Numerical methods","Burden, R.L., Faires, J.D., (2011) Numerical Analysis, , (9th edition), Brooks/Cole, Boston, MA; Ansari, K.A., (2006) An Introduction to Numerical Methods Using MathCad, , SDC Pub, Mission, KS; Jaun, A., Hedin, J., Johnson, T., Teaching computational methods for partial differential equations using the web (2001) Computing in Science and Engineering, 3 (3), pp. 83-85. , DOI 10.1109/5992.919272; Ubal, R., Cano, J.-C., Petit, S., Sahuquillo, J., RACFP: A training tool to work with floating-point representation, algorithms, and circuits in undergraduate courses (2006) IEEE Transactions on Education, 49 (3), pp. 321-331. , DOI 10.1109/TE.2006.879240; Harris, J.G., Colvin, M., Fleishon, N., The excellence in mathematics, science and engineering (emse) project at cal poly (1996) Proceedings of the 26th Annual Conference of the Frontiers in Education, 3, pp. 1267-1270. , 6-9 November 1996, IEEE Conference Publications; Hansen, E.W., Integrated mathematics and physical science: A new approach for fi rst year students at dartmouth college (1998) Proceedings of the 28th Annual Conference of the Frontiers in Education, 2, p. 579. , 4-7 November 1998 IEEE Conference Publications; Szatmari, I., Pattern formation in oscillatory media: Beyond reaction-diffusion model (2010) 12th International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and Their Applications (CNNA), pp. 1-5. , 3-5 February 2010, IEEE Conference Publications; Zhang, S., Numerical simulation of reaction-diffusion process about sewage discharge in yangtze estuary (2011) Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation, 4, pp. 2156-2160. , July; Ikebe, M., Asai, T., Hirose, T., Amemiya, Y., A quadrilateral-object composer for binary images with reaction-diffusion cellular automata (2004) Proceedings of 2004 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Advanced System Integrated Circuits, pp. 406-409. , 16-4, Proceedings of 2004 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Advanced System Integrated Circuits; Arena, P., Branciforte, M., Dibernardo, G., Occhipin, L., Reaction-diffusion cnn chip i ic implementation (2000) Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, pp. 419-422. , ISCAS 2000, Geneva 3, May 2000 (IEEE Conference Publications; Henderson, T.C., Venkataraman, R., Choikim, G., Reaction-diffusion patterns in smart sensor networks (2004) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 654-658. , ICRA 1, April-May 2004 (IEEE Conference Publications; Chan, P.W.C., Salansky, N., Glass, I.I., Chemical-reaction and diffusion rates in solids produced by shock compression (1986) Journal of Applied Physics, 59, pp. 1956-1961; Website of the Northwest Distributed Computer Science Department, , http://ai.vancouver.wsu.edu/~nwdcsd/wiki/index.php/How_animals_get_their, (accessed July 2012); Murray, J.D., (1990) Mathematical Biology, pp. 436-441. , Springer Verlag, New York; http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tiger_4539.jpg#fi, lelinks (accessed August 2012); Turing, A., The chemical basis of morphogenesis (1952) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, B327, pp. 37-72; Turing's Morphogenensis at, , http://cgjennings.ca/toybox/turingmorph, (accessed July 2012); Bassari, E., Bryant, R., George, M., Yerion, K.A., A fi nite difference method for modeling the formation of animal coat patterns (2009) Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 10, pp. 1730-1737; Haberman, R., (2004) Applied Partial Differential Equations with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems, , (4th Edition), Pearson, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Yerion, K., Gaussian Elimination and Dynamical Systems (1997) College mathematics journal, 28 (2), pp. 89-97; Peaceman, D.W., Rachford, H.H., The numerical solution of parabolic and elliptical equations (1955) J.

The improvement of GTAs' teaching skills relies on effective formative and summative feedback about their teaching. An absence of robust, theory-driven feedback tools can limit the scope and the usefulness of feedback to GTAs. Purpose: This article focuses on the validation of a student survey that provides pedagogical feedback to GTAs. This survey's development was guided by the How People Learn (HPL) framework. Consisting of four dimensions (knowledge-centeredness, learner-centeredness, assessment-centeredness, and community-centeredness), this framework has been used to empirically assess GTA teaching and student learning, especially in engineering. Method: The survey was validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with prior external content validity checks. We used EFA to identify distinct factors in the survey. The analyses informed item development on the final survey that operationalized the dimensions of the HPL framework. Results: We produced a 29-item survey informed by the HPL framework. Three distinct factors were identified in the survey structure after two rounds of EFA. These factors represent an individual dimension or a hybrid of dimensions of the HPL framework. Conclusion: This article describes the development of a survey that is ready for use by engineering GTAs to solicit feedback from students. From survey results, GTAs may obtain HPL-based teaching profiles that translate theory to practice. Implications for practice are also provided to facilitate the implementation of the survey, to improve the effectiveness of GTA teaching, and to enhance engineering student learning. © 2013 ASEE.","Graduate teaching assistants; How People Learn; Survey validation","Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA); Four dimensions; Graduate teaching assistants; How people learn; Individual dimensions; Student learning; Student surveys; Undergraduate education; Engineering education; Factor analysis; Students; Surveys","Ambrose, S.A., Bridges, M.W., DiPietro, M., Lovett, M.C., Norman, M.K., (2010) How learning works: Seven research-based principles for smart teaching, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Benner, P., (1984) From novice to expert, , Menlo Park, CA: Addison Wesley; Birol, G., Liu, S., Smith, H.D., Hirsch, P., Educational modules in tissue engineering based on the ""How People Learn"" framework (2006) Bioscience Education E-journal, 7, pp. 1-13. , http://journals.heacademy.ac.uk/doi/pdf/10.3108/beej.2006.07000007, Retrieved from; Black, B., Kaplan, M., (1997) A guidebook for University of Michigan graduate student instructors, , (6th ed.).

Nonetheless, students often lack conceptual understanding. Purpose (Hypothesis): The aim of this study was to discover how to facilitate the acquisition of conceptual understanding. We hypothesized that adding an instructional approach in the form of inquiry learning in a virtual lab would be more effective than relying on traditional instruction alone. Design/Method: Students in secondary vocational engineering education were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in a quasi-experimental study. In the traditional condition, the curriculum was supplemented with computer-based practice. In the virtual lab condition, the traditional curriculum was supplemented with inquiry learning in a virtual lab. Results: Results showed that students in the virtual lab condition scored significantly higher on conceptual understanding (Cohen's d=0.65) and on procedural skills (d=0.76). In particular, students in this condition scored higher (d=1.19) on solving complex problems. This result occurred for both complex conceptual and procedural problems. Conclusion: Since students in the virtual lab condition acquired better conceptual understanding and also developed better procedural skills than students in the traditional condition, it appears that conceptual understanding and procedural skills develop in an iterative fashion. © 2013 ASEE.","Conceptual understanding; Inquiry learning; Virtual labs","Conceptual understanding; Effective approaches; Electrical circuit; Engineering curriculum; Inquiry learning; Iterative fashion; Traditional instruction; Virtual lab; Curricula; Engineering education; Laboratories; Networks (circuits); Students; E-learning","Alfieri, L., Brooks, P.J., Aldrich, N.J., Tenenbaum, H.R., Does discovery-based instruction enhance learning?

Purpose/Hypothesis: This study evaluated the effectiveness and applicability of the Differentiated Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework, which classifies learning activities as interactive, constructive, or active, for engineering classes. We tested the ICAP hypothesis that student learning is more effective in interactive than constructive activities, which are more effective than active activities, which are more effective than passive activities. Design/Method: We conducted two studies to determine how and to what degree differentiated activities affected student learning outcomes; we measured student knowledge and understanding of materials science and engineering concepts. Results: Study 1 showed that students scored higher on all postclass quiz questions after participating in interactive and constructive activities than after the active activities. Student scores on more difficult, inference questions suggested that interactive activities provided significantly deeper learning than constructive or active activities. Study 2 showed that student learning, in terms of gain scores, increased systematically from passive to active to constructive to interactive, as predicted by the ICAP hypothesis. All the increases, from condition to condition, were significant. Conclusions: Our analyses of classroom activities in the engineering domain showed that they fit within the taxonomy of the DOLA framework. The results of the two studies provided evidence to support the predictions of the ICAP hypothesis. © 2013 ASEE.","Active learning; Engineering learning; Instructional methods","Active Learning; Active learning methods; Engineering classrooms; Engineering learning; Instructional methods; Interactive activities; Materials science and engineering; Student learning outcomes; Engineering; Students; Engineering education","Blanchard, M.R., Southerland, S.A., Osborne, J.W., Sampson, V.D., Annetta, L.A., Granger, E.M., Is inquiry possible in light of accountability?: A quantitative comparison of the relative effectiveness of guided inquiry and verification laboratory instruction (2010) Science Education, 94, pp. 577-616; Burleson, W., Ganz, A., Harris, I., Educational innovations in multimedia systems (2001) Journal of Engineering Education, 90 (1), pp. 21-31; Callister, W.D., (2006) Materials science and engineering: An introduction, , 7th ed.)

Purpose/Hypothesis: The measure of how well an implemented intervention follows the original is called fidelity of implementation. This theory was used to address the research questions: What is the fidelity of implementation of selected RBIS in engineering science courses? That is, how closely does engineering science classroom practice reflect the intentions of the original developers? Do the critical components that characterize an RBIS discriminate between engineering science faculty members who claimed use of the RBIS and those who did not? Design/Method: A survey of 387 U.S. faculty teaching engineering science courses (e.g., statics, circuits, thermodynamics) included questions about class time spent on 16 critical components and use of 11 corresponding RBIS. Fidelity was quantified as the percentage of RBIS users who also spent time on corresponding critical components. Discrimination between users and nonusers was tested using chi square. Results: Overall fidelity of the 11 RBIS ranged from 11% to 80% of users spending time on all required components. Fidelity was highest for RBIS with one required component: case-based teaching, just-in-time teaching, and inquiry learning. Thirteen of 16 critical components discriminated between users and nonusers for all RBIS to which they were mapped. Conclusions: Results were consistent with initial mapping of critical components to RBIS. Fidelity of implementation is a potentially useful framework for future work in STEM undergraduate education. © 2013 ASEE.","Engineering science; Fidelity of implementation; Research-based instructional strategies (RBIS)","Engineering science; Fidelity of implementation; Instructional practices; Instructional strategy; Just-in-Time Teaching; Research questions; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics educations; Undergraduate education; Research; Teaching; Thermodynamics; Engineering education","(2009) Creating a culture for scholarly and systematic innovation in engineering education: Ensuring U.S. engineering has the right people with the right talent for a global society, , American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE).

For this purpose, the history of this journal has been presented from a citation perspective. To identify leading and evolving research areas within IJEEE the authors conducted keyword analysis, which additionally showed how IJEEE contains both educational and technical contributions. The authors also studied the temporal evolution and distribution of keywords. Word co-occurrence was analysed to discover the main context in which the keywords have been used. The analysis also revealed the prominent contributors within the community of IJEEE based on various authorship and citation criteria. It was observed that the influential authors appear in multiple ways, i.e. most of the authors who were influential by one criterion also made to the top list of other criteria. The authors concluded that the single-author pattern is quite prominent within this community, and very little work has been done between the same co-authors. Therefore, there is a need to encourage IJEEE authors to write more collaborative publications so that the authorship/co-authorship network may grow. © Manchester University Press.","citation analysis; collaboration; engineering education; impact factor; keyword analysis; social network analysis","Education; Social networking (online); Citation analysis; collaboration; Impact factor; International journals; keyword analysis; Technical contribution; Temporal evolution; Word co-occurrence; Engineering education","Andrade, M.A., Valencia, A., Automatic extraction of keywords from scientifi c text: Application to the knowledge domain of protein families (1998) Bioinformatics, 14, p. 72; (2009) The Rise of Retractions in Science-more Misconduct or Stiffer Scrutiny?, , http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.aspstorycode=407826, last accessed November 2010; Pinski, G., Narin, F., Citation infl uence for journal aggregates of scientifi c publications: Theory, with application to the literature of physics (1976) Information Processing & Management, 12, pp. 297-312; Moed, H.F., New developments in the use of citation analysis in research evaluation (2009) Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis, 57, pp. 13-18; Garfield, E., The use of journal impact factors and citation analysis for evaluation of science (1998) 41st Annual Meeting of the Council of Biology Editors, Salt Lake City, UT; Garfield, E., (1972) Citation Analysis As A Tool in Journal Evaluation, , American Association for the Advancement of Science; Cason, H., Lubotsky, M., The infl uence and dependence of psychological journals on each other (1936) Psychol.

Representations are learning tools that can help students understand conceptual systems by providing insight to a concept, problem, or system through explicit cues. Researchers at the University of Idaho have developed structured activities involving animations that are representations of traffic simulations designed as part of the Mobile Signal Timing Training (MOST) project for teaching traffic signal timing. In this study, the effectiveness of the MOST animations were evaluated through a pre-/postcomparative case study. Overall, the MOST animations were successful in improving student understanding of timing parameters involved in actuated control at signalized intersections. The MOST activities were more effective than comparison methods in facilitating student learning for concepts of minimum green time, maximum green time, and duration of the green indication. Students also showed an improved understanding of the relationship between cycle length and delay and passage time, but not more so than comparison students. Results indicate that animations are effective in improving student understanding of concepts involving dynamic processes or reactions. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Animation; Engineering education; Learning tools; Mobile signal timing training (MOST); Traffic management","Engineering concepts; Learning tool; Mobile signals; Signalized intersection; Traffic management; Traffic signal timings; Traffic simulations; Transportation engineering; Animation; Civil engineering; Engineering education; Highway traffic control; Research; Street traffic control; Timing circuits; Traffic signals; Students","Bham, G.H., Cernusca, D., Luna, R., Manepalli, U.R.R., Longitudinal evaluation of a GIS laboratory in a transportation engineering course (2011) J.

The writers have tried to motivate students to learn structural analysis and design by using classical theory, performing calculations by hand, using a computer program, and using a plastic toy for model trusses to measure strain and stresses. These allow a comparison of results between the three methods. At the end of the course there is a rapid bridge-building contest with simple materials to develop the students' capacity for ingenuity and teamwork, design different structural typologies, and meet aesthetic and resistance criteria.

In order to achieve the concept of sustainable development in the project life cycle of green building, a holistic approach to green practice is needed. Unlike traditional construction approaches, adopting the green practice approach calls for more cohesive collaborations among different stakeholders. This study aims to elicit a better understanding of how green practice influences collaborative work (CW). Data were collected through green technical documents of several real-life projects and interviews with owners, contractors, designers, cost estimators, and government officials in China. A conceptual framework for determining the structure and content of the impact of green practice in CW was mapped; four potential conflicts were identified. Further analysis was used to explore the mitigation strategies that could be used to make CW particularly suitable for green building implementation. The study will help stakeholders identify their objectives and to strategically facilitate a more collaborative work environment. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","China; Collaborative work; Conceptual framework; Green practice","China; Collaborative Work; Conceptual frameworks; Government officials; Green practice; Mitigation strategy; Technical documents; Traditional constructions; Civil engineering; Engineering education; Construction industry","Adler, A., (2006) Green Building: Project Planning and Cost Estimating, , 2nd Ed.

Lack of highly skilled graduates increases recruitment costs and affects the performance of the UK industry. Employers should therefore supply more feedback on the quality of graduates to make sure the changing requirements of industry are recognized and reflected in engineering degree programs. This research investigated how linking students throughout their degree study with employers affected students, academia, and employers. Evidence was obtained from sponsored and placement undergraduate engineering students in a department of Civil and Building Engineering, their academic tutors, and their employers. The results showed sponsored engineering programs that are operated by a university department in cooperation with employers matched the needs of students and requirements of employers. Sponsorship allowed both students and sponsors to have practical experience of working arrangements over three or more years before either party made a full commitment, it helped to develop undergraduate programs, and provided students with experience of real-life industrial engineering challenges. The main conclusions to be drawn from this study are sponsorship is a valuable strategy for enhancing the professional skills of intending engineers. More feedback from employers on the quality of graduates should be provided to departments of engineering so that the changing requirements of industry are recognized and reflected in engineering degree programs. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Engineering education; Industrial sponsorship; Professional skills; University-industry (U-I) links","Building engineering; Engineering graduates; Industrial sponsorships; Practical experience; Professional skills; Undergraduate engineering students; Undergraduate program; University industries; Engineering; Engineering education; Industry; Students","Ahmed, Y., (2009) The Impact of Work Placements on the Development of Transferable Skills in Engineering, , Ph.D. thesis, Loughborough Univ.

This application allows student self-evaluation of the calculations and problems involved in practical work. Students can evaluate their calculations before the final evaluation, minimizing the usual mistakes, primarily those of calculation errors. The evaluation of this system is based on the numbers and types of access to the system; the results of a satisfaction survey; and, primarily, a test of the proposed learning methodology. These results have demonstrated the viability of the tool developed in this project with regard to achieving the main objective, which consists of the students' self-evaluation of their calculations and assimilation of the causes of their mistakes. The system is therefore shown to reinforce and stimulate autonomous learning. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Engineering education; Land surveys; Photogrammetry; Topographic surveys; Web-based system","Autonomous learning; Calculation error; Land surveys; Practical works; Self evaluation; Topographic surveys; Web-based system; Engineering education; Photogrammetry; Students; World Wide Web; Surveys","Chau, K.W., Web-based interactive computer-aided learning package on open channel flow: Innovations, challenges and experiences (2007) J.

Unfortunately, the methods used in engineering undergraduate classrooms are described as ""abstract"" and have mixed results related to impacting students' ethical development. Thus, exploring how out-of-classroom experiences-as a curricular alternative-influences students' ethical development is warranted. This is an exploratory investigation to determine how out-of-classroom experiences influence students' ethical development. The authors define ethical development using three constructs: knowledge of ethics, ethical reasoning, and ethical behavior. We draw upon a conceptual model that suggests students' ethical development is impacted by what takes place inside and outside of the classroom. As the first phase of a multi-year, national study to holistically assess the ethical development of engineering undergraduates in the United States, we conducted focus groups consisting of faculty members and students at 18 institutions. All focus group participants were asked questions related to campus climate, ethics, and involvement in outof-classroom experiences. Our data suggest that participating in out-of-classroom experiences: served as a complement to the classroom instruction on ethics; helped students connect learning about ethics to the engineering workplace; and, influenced students' ethical development. Given what we learned about the engineering undergraduates' involvement in out-of-classroom experiences, we suggest that engineering faculty members use classroom instruction to connect out-ofclassroom experiences to ethics and encourage reflective practice in ethics instruction. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Ethics; Out-of-classroom; Qualitative","Classroom instruction; Engineering curriculum; Engineering faculty members; Engineering undergraduates; Engineering workplace; Ethics; Out-of-classroom; Qualitative; Engineering; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Philosophical aspects","Coyle, E.J., Jamieson, L.H., Oakes, W.C., Integrating engineering education and community service: Themes for the future of engineering education (2006) Journal of Engineering Education, 95 (1), pp. 7-11; Johanessen, D., Shen, D., Marra, R.M., Cho, Y.H., Lo, J.L., Lohani, V.K., Engaging and supporting problem solving in engineering ethics (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (3), pp. 235-253; Whitbeck, C., Teaching ethics to scientists and engineers: Moral agents and moral problems (1995) Science and Engineering Ethics, 1, pp. 299-308; Colby, A., Sullivan, W.M., Ethics teaching in undergraduate engineering education (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3), pp. 327-338; Haws, D.R., Ethics instruction in engineering education: A (mini) meta-analysis (2001) Journal of Engineering Education, 90 (2), pp. 223-229; Self, D.J., Ellison, E.M., Teaching engineering ethics: Assessment of its influence on moral reasoning skills (1998) Journal of Engineering Education, 87 (1), pp. 29-34; Abraham, S., Knies, A.D., Kurral, K.L., Willis, T.E., Experiences in discussing ethics with undergraduate engineers (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (4), pp. 305-307; Holsapple, M.A., Carpenter, D.D., Sutkus, J.A., Finelli, C.J., Harding, T.S., Framing faculty and student discrepancies in engineering ethics education delivery (2012) Journal of Engineering Education, 101 (2), pp. 169-186; Harding, T.S., Carpenter, D.D., Finelli, C.J., An exploratory investigation of the ethical behavior of engineering undergraduates (2012) Journal of Engineering Education, 101 (2), pp. 346-374; Bielby, R.M., Harding, T.S., Carpenter, D.D., Finelli, C.J., Sutkus, J.A., Burt, B.A., Ra, E., Holsapple, M.A., Impact of different curricular approaches to ethics (2011) Proceedings of the ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, , Vancouver, Canada; Finelli, C.J., Ra, E., Holsapple, M.A., Bielby, R.M., Burt, B.A., Carpenter, D.D., Harding, T.S., Sutkus, J.A., An assessment of engineering students' curricular and co-curricular experiences and their ethical development (2012) Journal of Engineering Education, 101 (3), pp. 469-494; Astin, A., (1993) What Matters in College?

In geo-spatial data presentation, exploration and analysis, knowledge is disseminated, accumulated or accentuated. For learning purpose, this knowledge needs to be evaluated. The increasing use of the computer and multi-media to disseminate geographical information place their own specific demands for the final user. By visual presentation, exploration and analysis users are able to identify features in their minds, since visualization qualifies results and not quantification of results. In the Engineering Education (EE) setup, students create Geoinformation related applications which are archived for later use. The spatial knowledge accumulated is sometimes difficult to apprehend when retrieved. Thus a procedure, such as VPA Archival Management System (VAMS), is needed to recall the ideas embedded in the archived datasets. The test method used is the Verbal Protocol Analysis (VPA). In addition, use of explicit structured questionnaire, video recording, onscreen capturing, and formative evaluation and case study frameworks were used to efficiently, effectively and satisfactorily determine the spatial cognition taking place in user's minds. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering Education (EE); Geoinformation; Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Usability Engineering (UE); VPA Archival Management System (VAMS)","Formative evaluation; Geo-information; Geographical information; Human computer interaction (HCI); Management systems; Spatial cognition; Verbal protocol analysis; Visual presentation; Management; Testing; Usability engineering; Video recording; Engineering education","Haklay, M.M., Zafiri, A., Usability Engineering for GIS: Learning from a Screenshot (2008) The Cartographic Journal, 45 (2), pp. 87-97; Jones, C.E., Cartographic theory and principles (2010) Interacting with Geospatial Technologies, pp. 37-66. , M.

One of the most popular trends on this sense is the use of mobile devices to learn, in which is known as mLearning. It facilitates the participation and the interaction of students anywhere and anytime through such kind of devices. However mLearning should not be considered as a replacement of eLearning (understood as the Internet application to learning). It supports eLearning; therefore it should take into account the existing eLearning landscape. This implies that it is necessary to take into account the application of 2.0 Web tools, which enables an online implementation of the student-centred learning paradigm, where the learner happens to have a more central role in her training. This, joined to the necessity to take into account the learning obtained not only in the institutions, leads to definition of the Personal Learning Environments that need to coexist with the traditional learning platforms, the Learning Management Systems. So, in this case mobile learning should facilitate the use of mobile devices to support these two learning ecosystems. To do so, this paper describes a service-based framework approach to implement a mobile Personal Learning Environment, which allows the integration of functionalities from the institutional learning platforms. With such system the learner can combine institutional tools with others she use to learn in a mobile system and reflect the activity carried out on them into the institutional side. This system is implemented and validated through its application into a Computer Science subject. The paper will show the difficulty of such application and some of its benefits such as the increase of student motivation and participation because of the use of the PLE and the mobile tools. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Computer Science; Interoperability; Learning; Mobile devices; Personal Learning Environments; Validation","Educational activities; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning; Learning and teachings; Learning management system; Personal learning environment; Student-centred learning; Validation; Computer aided instruction; Computer science; Information technology; Interoperability; Learning systems; Mobile devices; Societies and institutions; Students; Engineering education","(2011) Mesuring the Information Society, , ITU, International Telecommunication Union, Geneva, Switzerland 92-61-13111-5; Rinaldi, M., (2011) Revolución Mobile Learning, , Lulu.com; Yu-mei, P., Xue-jun, Z., Li, L., Learning can happen anytime and anywhere: The application of m-learning in medical education (2010) Second International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science (ETCS), pp. 508-511. , Wuhan, China, 2010; Conde, M.A., Muñoz, C., García, F.J., Mlearning, the first step in the learning process revolution (2008) International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM), 2 (4), pp. 61-63; Keegan, D., (2005) Mobile Learning: The Next Generation of Learning, , Dublin: Distance Education International; Muilenburg, L., Berge, Z., Mlearning and individualized learning (2009) World Conference on E-learning in Corporate, pp. 1383-1388. , Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 2009, Vancouver, Canada; Kovačević, Minović, M., Milovanović, M., Ordóñez-de-Pablos, P., Starčević, D., Motivational aspects of different learning contexts: ""My mom won't let me play this game⋯"" (2013) Computers in Human Behaviour, 29 (2), pp. 354-363; Prendes, M.P., (2009) Plataformas de Campus Virtuales de Software Libre: Ancilisis Compartivo de la Situation Actual de las Universidades Españoles., , Informe del proyecto EA-2008-0257 de la Secretaría de Estado de Universidades e Investigation; Wexler, S., Dublin, L., Grey, N., Jagannathan, S., Karrer, T., Martinez, M., Mosher, B., Barneveld, A.V., Learning management systems.

The aim of this educational game is primarily to improve the students' understanding of financial engineering using the principle of situational learning. The game is conceived as a simulation of a small scale financial market, where students act as participants in the market transactions, with their own virtual capital. In a defined space of time the students build their portfolios, which contain only shares at the beginning of the game, and they make decisions using the methods and techniques from the given teaching unit. Changing the initial conditions, throughout the game, the students can expand their portfolio acquiring bonds and derivatives such as options, in order to better diversify their portfolios. This educational game has a twofold use, as an auxiliary teaching tool and as a tool for testing the students' achievement. In comparison with completing classic-type tasks, this game can help test the students' competence to apply the acquired knowledge in close-to-reality situations. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Asset pricing models; Education; Financial engineering; Games","Asset pricing model; Educational game; Financial engineering; Financial market; Games; Initial conditions; Market transactions; Teaching tools; Commerce; Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Students; Education computing","Markowitz, H.M., Foundation of portfolio theory (1991) Journal of Finance, 46 (2), p. 469; Sharpe, W.F., Capital asset prices: A theory of market equilibrium under conditions of risk (1964) Journal of Finance, 19 (3), pp. 425-442; Vasicek, O.A., An equilibrium characterization of the term structure (1977) Journal of Financial Economics, 5, pp. 177-188; Cox, J.C., Ingersoll, J.E., Ross, S.A., An intertemporal general equilibrium model of asset prices (1985) Econometrica, 53 (2), pp. 363-384; Radović-Marković, M., Education through e-learning: Case of Serbia (2009) Journal of Business Economics and Management, 10 (4), pp. 313-319; Minović, J.Z., Minović, M., Milovanović, M., Primena edukativnih igara za učenje modela klasičnih finansija (2011) Info M, Časopis Za Informacione Tehnologije i Multimedijalne Sisteme, 10 (38), pp. 29-36; Reinhardt, G., Cook, L.S., Is this a game or a learning moment?

This study proposes the use of a graphical human interface to facilitate learning in an experimental module in mechatronics. Students learn the principles, function, and application of mechatronics via the interface to demonstrate the use of technology in human-computer interaction. This study focused on five main elements: (1) The development and testing of a learning platform for the mechatronics module; (2) learning exercises specifically tailored to laboratory objectives; (3) the convenience and user-friendliness of the proposed system; (4) the technical aspects of the platform in question; (5) the development of approaches to further enhance learning. This paper makes two fundamental contributions to the field of mechatronics education. First, we have developed a system that provides greater flexibility, accessibility, and ease of use for students. Second, we present an approach to curriculum development that is demonstrably faster in its progress from design to process planning. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Control system; Human computer interaction (HCI) technology; Mechatronics; Monitoring","Curriculum development; Development and testing; Experimental modules; Human computer interaction (HCI); Learning platform; Mechatronics education; Teaching curriculum; Technical aspects; Control systems; Curricula; Human computer interaction; Mechatronics; Monitoring; Engineering education","Li, J., Wang, J., Design and implementation of the networked control laboratory (2008) International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology, pp. 290-294; Helander, M.G., Emami, M.R., Engineering e-laboratories: Integration of remote access and e-collaboration (2008) International Journal of Engineering Education, 24 (3), pp. 466-479; D'Andrea, A.N., Giannetti, F., Manara, G., Michelini, M., Nepa, P., A virtual educational laboratory for telecommunications engineering (2008) International Journal of Engineering Education, 24 (1), pp. 144-152; McKay, E., (2007) Enhancing Learning Through Human Computer Interaction, , ISBN 978-1599043289, IGI Global; Moulton, B., Natividad, C., Remotely accessible laboratory model for enabling improved understanding of robot simultaneous localization and mapping (2009) World Transactions on Engineering and Technology Education, 7 (1), pp. 17-21; Hewett, T.T., Baecker, R., Card, S., Carey, T., Gasen, J., Mantei, M., Perlman, G., Verplank, W., (1992) Association of Computing Machinery ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human Computer Interaction, , ACM Press, New York; McCrickard, D.S., Chewar, C.M., Somervell, J., Design, science, and engineering topics?

A supervised image segmentation algorithm is used to detect the face and hair of students in head posture images. A simple and effective human presence detection and gaze direction estimation method is then developed based on changes in the face and hair information. First, the proposed algorithm is tested using 10 different students with seven different head postures each and 92% of the head postures are identified accurately. Second, the method is applied to real time video sequences containing 80 frames that lasted 400 seconds, which are acquired using an integrated web camera, and similar results are obtained. Finally, human-computer interaction data, which is an indicator of student attention, is calculated based on the human presence and gaze direction over time. The experimental results show that the proposed approach enhances human-computer interactions for e-learning systems and helps us to evaluate student performance. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","E-learning; Engineering education; Human-computer interaction; Machine vision","E-learning systems; Gaze direction; Head posture; Image segmentation algorithm; Presence detections; Real time videos; Student performance; Web camera; Computer vision; E-learning; Engineering education; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Students; Human computer interaction","Rosenberg, M., (2001) E-learning: Strategies for Delivering Knowledge in the Digital Age, , McGraw Hill; Alexander, S., E-learning developments and experiences (2001) Education + Training, 43 (4-5), pp. 240-248; Twigg, C., Quality, cost and access: The case for redesign (2002) The Wired Tower, , Prentice-Hall, New Jersey; Keegan, D., (1993) Theoretical Principles of Distance Education, , Routledge, New Fetter Lane; Picard, R.W., Klein, J., Computers that recognize and respond to user emotions, theoretical and practical implications (2002) MIT Media Lab Tech Report, p. 538; Shen, L., Wang, M., Shen, R., Affective e-learning: Using emotional data to improve learning in pervasive learning environment (2009) Educational Technology & Society, 12 (2), pp. 176-189; Shneiderman, B., The future of interactive systems and the emergence of direct manipulation (1982) Behavior and Information Technology, pp. 237-256; Maybury, M.T., Wahlster, W., (1998) Readings in Intelligent User Interfaces, , Morgan Kaufmann Press, San Francisco; Kirlik, A., (2006) Adaptive Perspectives on Human-technology Interaction, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Oviatt, S., Cohen, P., Wu, L., Vergo, J., Duncan, L., Suhm, B., Bers, J., Ferro, D., Designing the user interface for multimodal speech and pen-based gesture applications: State-of-the-art systems and future research directions (2000) Human-Computer Interaction, 15 (4), pp. 263-322; Gavrila, D.M., The visual analysis of human movement: A survey (1999) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 73 (1), pp. 82-98; Sibert, L.E., Jacob, R.J.K., Evaluation of eye gaze interaction (2000) Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 281-288; Ugurlu, Y., Measuring the impact of virtual instrumentation for teaching and research (2011) Proceedings of IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, pp. 152-158. , Amman, Jordan, April 4-6; Ugurlu, Y., Sakuta, H., E-learning for graphical system design courses: A case study (2012) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Technology Enhanced Education, pp. 1-5. , Kerala, India, January 3-5; Eisenhauer, M., Hoffman, B., Kretschmer, D., (2002) State of the Art Human-computer Interaction, , GigaMobile/D2.7.1; Karray, F., Alemzadeh, M., Saleh, J.A., Arab, M.N., Human-computer interaction: Overview on state of the art (2008) International Journal on Smart Sensing and Intelligent Systems, 1 (1), pp. 137-159; Ekanayake, H., Karunarathna, D.D., Hewagamage, K.P., Cognitive architecture for affective e-learning (2006) Proceedings of the International Conference on ELearning for Knowledge-based Society, pp. 1-8. , Bangkok, Thailand, August 3-4; Brunelli, R., Poggio, T., Face recognition: Features versus templates (1993) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 15, pp. 1042-1052; Li, S.Z., Jain, A.K., (2004) Handbook of Face Recognition, , Springer; Hsu, R.-L., Abdel-Mottaleb, M., Jain, A.K., Face detection in color images (2002) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 24 (5), pp. 696-706. , DOI 10.1109/34.1000242; Jones, M.J., Rehg, J.M., Statistical color models with application to skin detection (1999) Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 274-280. , Fort Collins, USA, June 23-25; Viola, P., Jones, M., Robust real-time face detection, International (2004) Journal on Computer Vision, 57 (2), pp. 137-154; Edwards, G.J., Taylor, C.J., Cootes, T.F., Learning to identify and track faces in image sequences (1998) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 317-322. , Washington DC, USA, January 4-7; Phung, S.L., Bouzerdoum, A., Chai, D., Skin segmentation using color pixel classification: Analysis and comparison (2005) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 27 (1), pp. 148-154. , DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2005.17; Pham, D.L., Xu, C., Prince, J.L., Current methods in medical image segmentation (2000) Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering, 2, pp. 315-337; Atharifard, A., Ghofrani, S., Robust component-based face detection using color feature (2011) Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering, pp. 3781-3791. , London, U.

Along with new equipment and modern electronics, there are new opportunities in the automation control. This paper presents a hand motion controller, which measures the orientation of the upper limb of a man in three dimensional space. The design assumes the use of microcontrollers from Texas Instruments, which will be responsible for communication between specific modules. It assumed the usage of two types of communication UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) and I2C (called Inter-Integrated Circuit). Microcontrollers will also be responsible for monitoring the voltage and simple calculations. The entire system has been sown in the glove acting module possible to connect to different devices, and communicating through the I2C bus with the master device. In order to visualize the controller a hand model was developed in an environment of OpenGL and 3ds Max. Subsequently, the control program which is responsible for calculating the rotation matrix, and the calculation (using data from the matrix) of degrees of freedom associated with the forearm and the arm, was implemented. This is a broader issue related to the large number of calculations which are not capable of microcontrollers (requires a large computational power), that was the reason which extorted the computer's calculations communicated with the controller wirelessly by Bluetooth. In order to present the results, a physical manipulator, which mimics the trajectory of hand movement, was connected to a personal computer. Presented system is used on the experimental laboratory education on Chair of Computing Engineering at Poznan University of Technology in Poland. The objective is to present remote laboratory kits for teaching and learning some aspects of control systems. Additionally, the effectiveness of the platforms in educating students is discussed. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Hand motion controller; Rotation matrix; Three-axis gyroscopes model; Wireless navigation controller","Electrical and computer engineering; Experimental laboratory; Hand motion; Rotation matrices; Teaching and learning; Three dimensional space; Three-axis gyroscopes; Wireless navigation; Application programming interfaces (API); Asynchronous sequential logic; Communication; Computer peripheral equipment; Education computing; Engineering education; Motion control; Personal computers; Controllers","Behnke, S., Mueller, J., Schreiber, M., Using handheld computers to control humanoid robots (2005) Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Dextrous Autonomous Robots and Humanoids (darh2005), , Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, May, paper no. 3.2; Bates, A.W., Poole, G., (2003) Effective Teaching with Technology in Higher Education: Foundations for Success, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; Bekele, T.A., Motivation and satisfaction in internet-supported learning environments: A review (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (2), pp. 116-127; Cooper, M., Keating, D., Harwin, W., Dautenhahn, K., Robots in the classroom: Tools for accessible education (1999) Assistive Technology on the Threshold of the New Millennium, pp. 448-452. , C.

This paper turns to engineering students to explore what they think it takes to become a good engineer. Profiles are identified by means of a large-scale survey-based investigation of the perceptions of first year engineering students in the US and in Denmark with respect to the importance of math/science skills and interpersonal and professional skills for successful engineering. Four groups of first year engineering students are defined according to combinations of high and low importance assessments of each of the two skill types in both countries. This leads to analytically derived groups emphasizing math/ science skills, interpersonal and professional skills, both skill types, and none of the skills. Differences and similarities between these groups are explored in terms of relative group sizes and gender composition, levels of confidence, and motivation to study engineering. The findings show that the four engineering student groups have distinct profiles with different characteristics in terms of motivation and confidence and which may each require different educational approaches to become broad thinking engineers. Apart from the exploratory investigation of group differences within each country, the paper also examines whether the four group profiles are nationally confined or if common tendencies shared by engineering students in both countries exist. The paper contributes to the literature on engineering education and serves to inform engineering educators and institutions worldwide with new insights into the expectations and perceptions of actual students who are at the very beginning of their pathway to an engineering education. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Broad thinking; Comparative survey analysis; Engineering education research; Engineering skills","Broad thinking; Educational approach; Engineering education research; Engineering educators; Engineering skills; First-year engineering; Professional skills; Survey analysis; Engineering; Engineering education; Engineers; Motivation; Surveys; Students","Christensen, S.H., Delahousse, B., Meganck, M., (2009) Engineering in Context, Academica, , Aarhus; Sustaining the Change, , http://www.abet.org/sustaining-change,2004, Accessed 6 September 2012; (2006) Engineering Change, Executive Summary, , http://www.abet.org/engineering-change, Accessed 6 September 2012; Armstrong, P.J., Crawley, E., Malmqvist, J., Östlund, S., Brodeur, D., The CDIO syllabus: Learning outcomes for engineering education Rethinking Engineering Education, pp. 43-76. , E.

In order to examine differences, we performed a research that included two of most popular aspect ratios: 4:3 and 16:9. Both aspect ratios were represented in desktop and handheld variant. The research referred to engineering students as readers. Engineering students were very interesting population for this research due to the fact that they spend most of their time reading electronic materials, during their education. Logically, it is necessary to measure how effective this way of reading educational material is. The general hypothesis of this study was that there is difference in usage of electronic reading material on screens with different aspect ratios, and that the current hype for widescreen displays is unjustified when it comes to reading electronic material. Reading time, amount of interactions and knowledge test scores were used as measures in experiment. Our results speak in favor of the hypothesis and suggest why proposed screen aspect ratio is the most suitable for reading electronic materials. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Electronic reading material; Engineering education; Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Screen aspect ratio; Usability testing","Amount of interaction; Educational materials; Electronic materials; Electronic reading; Handhelds; Human computer interaction (HCI); Usability testing; Engineering education; Materials; Research; Aspect ratio","Johnson, L., Smith, R., Willis, H., Levine, A., Haywood, K., (2011) The 2011 Horizon Report; Nelson, T., (1993) Literary Machines, , Mindful Press; Schumacher, G., Waller, R., (1985) Testing Design Alternatives: A Comparison of Procedures, , Designing Usable Texts, Orlando, FL; Dillon, A., Reading from paper versus screens: A critical review of the empirical literature (1992) Ergonomics, 35 (10), pp. 1297-1326; Gould, J.D., Alfaro, L., Barnes, V., Reading is slower from CRT displays than from paper: Attempts to isolate a single-variable explanation (1987) Human Factors, 29 (3), pp. 269-299; Gould, J.D., Alfaro, L., Finn, R., Haupt, B., Minuto, A., Reading from CRT displays can be as fast as reading from paper (1987) Human Factors, 29 (5), pp. 497-517; Morineau, T., Blanche, C., Tobin, L., Gueguen, N., The emergence of the contextual role of the e-book in cognitive processes through an ecological and functional analysis (2005) International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 62 (3), pp. 329-348. , DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.10.002, PII S1071581904001089; Cushman, W.H., Reading from microfiche, a VDT, and the printed page: Subjective fatigue and performance (1986) Human Factors, 28 (1), pp. 63-73; Muter, P., Maurutto, P., Reading and skimming from computer screens and books: The paperless office revisited?

The design of this new infrastructure for education in engineering is based on the study of some international examples (which will be succinctly presented) and also on the consideration of the role of space and equipment in teaching and learning practices and upon the desired structure of a modern engineering curriculum. The results presented were obtained through the analysis of a survey of the cohort of students who took courses in the old building (W), built in 1968, as well as in the ML building. The survey especially focused on how the new spaces affected the ways the students work and interact with their peers. In the concluding section, certain hypotheses derived from the results are presented with the intention of promoting further studies. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Active learning engineering; Engineering competences;

The present study describes the development and testing of a survey-based, self-report measure to assess the interdisciplinary competence of undergraduate engineers. Using a nationally representative sample of 5249 undergraduates from 31 institutions, three discrete scales related to interdisciplinary competence emerged from factor analytic procedures: Interdisciplinary Skills, Recognizing Disciplinary Perspectives, and Reflective Behavior. Construct validity of the metrics is demonstrated through a description of the rigorous research and development process for the survey items. Statistical analyses indicate that scales significantly distinguish groups of students (i.e., by engineering discipline and by class standing), thus demonstrating the metrics' concurrent validity. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Assessment; Interdisciplinary Skills; Learning outcomes","Assessment; Development and testing; Disciplinary perspective; Interdisciplinary competence; Interdisciplinary education; Interdisciplinary learning; Interdisciplinary skills; Learning outcome; Accreditation; Surveys; Engineering education","(2006) Summary of the President's FY 2006 Budget, , National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Health, Washington DC; (2004) Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research, , National Research Council, The National Academies Press, Washington, DC; (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering, National Academies Press, Washington DC; Wolfe, C.R., Haynes, C., Interdisciplinary writing assessment profiles (2003) Issues in Integrative Studies, 21, pp. 126-169; Boix Mansilla, V., Dawes Duraising, E., Targeted assessment of students' interdisciplinary work: An empirically grounded framework proposed (2007) Journal of Higher Education, 78 (2), pp. 215-237; Franks, D., Dale, P., Hindmarsh, R., Fellows, C., Buckridge, M., Cybinski, P., Interdisciplinary foundations: Reflecting on interdisciplinarity and three decades of teaching and research at Griffith University, Australia (2007) Studies in Higher Education, 32 (2), pp. 167-118; Klein, J.T., (2010) Creating Interdisciplinary Campus Cultures: A Model for Strength and Sustainability, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco; Klein, J.T., A taxonomy of interdisciplinarity (2010) The Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity, pp. 15-30. , R.

The present study investigated how students used lecture podcasts produced in two engineering courses at a South African university. The findings confirm much of the growing consensus in the literature. Firstly, a majority of students in the courses elected to use the podcasts. Secondly, the study notes that lecture attendance, in contexts where lectures are seen as beneficial, is not adversely affected. Thirdly, few students use podcasts in the mobile mode but most rather use them as an additional resource in their private study spaces. There is intense use in the build up to tests and examinations, and there is a particular benefit for students who are not first language speakers of the medium of instruction. This study also points to the existence of both deep and surface approaches to engaging with podcasts, with substantial evidence of many students using podcasts as a means towards better understanding. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","case study; engineering education; podcasting; student learning","Educational benefits; Engineering course; Higher education; In contexts; Lecture attendances; Podcasting; Student learning; Surface approach; Engineering education; Research; Technical presentations; Students","Bassey, M., (1999) Case Study Research in Educational Settings, , Buckingham, Buckingham,: Open University Press; Case, J., Gunstone, R., Lewis, A., Students' Metacognitive Development in an Innovative Second Year Chemical Engineering Course (2001) Research in Science Education, 31 (3), pp. 313-335. , doi:10.1023/A:1013113807788; Fietze, S., Podcast in Higher Education: Students Usage Behaviour Same Places, Different Spaces, pp. 314-318. , http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/auckland09/procs/, In: Atkinson R J, McBeath C., editors Proceedings ascilite Auckland 2009, 26th Annual ascilite International Conference, December, Auckland, Auckland, The University of Auckland, Auckland University of Technology, and Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ascilite); Fitzpatrick, J., Cronin, K., Byrne, E., Is Attending Lectures Still Relevant in Engineering Education?

We find that women are significantly more influenced by mentors than men, while men tend to be more motivated by intrinsic and financial factors, and by the social importance of the engineering profession. Parental influence is low across all programmes and by differentiating between specific clusters of engineering programmes, we further show that these overall gender differences are subtle and that motivational factors are unequally important across the different educational programmes. The findings from this study clearly indicate that intrinsic and social motivations are the most important motivational factors; however, gender and programme differentiation needs to be taken into account, and points towards diverse future strategies for attracting students to engineering education. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","attractiveness of education; engineering education research; gender studies; higher education","Educational programmes; Engineering education research; Engineering profession; Engineering programmes; Gender studies; Higher education; Parental influence; Social motivations; Engineering education; Population statistics; Students; Professional aspects","Alpay, E., Ahearn, A.L., Graham, R.H., Bull, A.M.J., Student Enthusiasm for Engineering: Charting Changes in Student Aspirations and Motivation (2008) European Journal of Engineering Education, 33 (5-6), pp. 573-585. , doi:10.1080/03043790802585454; Alpay, E., Hari, A., Kambouri, M., Ahearn, A.L., Gender Issues in the University Research Environment (2010) European Journal of Engineering Education, 35 (2), pp. 135-145. , doi:10.1080/03043790903497302; Atman, C.a.J., Sheppard, S.D., Turns, J., Adams, R.S., Fleming, L.N., Stevens, R., Streveler, R.A., (2010) Enabling Engineering Student Success: The Final Report for the Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education, , http://www.engr.washington.edu/caee/final_report.html, San Rafael, CA, San Rafael, CA,: Morgan & Claypool, Accessed August 28, 2012; Beddoes, K., Borrego, M., Feminist Theory in Three Engineering Education Journals: 1995-2008 (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (2), pp. 281-303. , doi:10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00014.x; Bruvik-Hansen, A., Billing, Y.D., (1984) Ærlig talt: Om kvinders forhold til ingeniøruddannelserne, , Oplag 6 af Forskningsrappor, Institut for Samfundsfag, Danmarks Tekniske Højskole; Du, X., Kolmos, A., Increasing the Diversity of Engineering Education - A Gender Analysis in a PBL Context (2009) European Journal of Engineering Education, 34 (5), pp. 425-437. , doi:10.1080/03043790903137577; Eris, O., Chachra, D., Chen, H.L., Sheppard, S., Ludlow, L., Rosca, C., Bailey, T., Toye, G., Outcomes of a Longitudinal Administration of the Persistence in Engineering Survey (2010) Journal of Engineering Education, 99 (4), pp. 371-395. , doi:10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01069.x; Science: It's a Girl Thing - Q&A (2012), http://science-girl-thing.eu/files/about/about-science-girl-thing-en.pdf, European Commission, Accessed August 28, 2012; (2008) The Life of Women and Men in Europe - A Statistical Portrait, , Eurostat, Luxembourg, Luxembourg,: European Commission, European Communities, 2008 ed., Statistical Books; Gill, J., Sharp, R., Mills, J., Franzway, S., I Still Wanna Be an Engineer!

Specifically, this study employs Internet Web-based technologies to allow for real-time video monitoring and execution of cutting-edge experiments. The students' activities within the module are centred on building a model of a shallow foundation on a sand deposit utilising a centrifuge facility and using this model for: (1) visual observation of the response of soil-foundation systems, (2) learning the use of instrumentation, (3) interpretation of acquired data, and (4) comparing experimental results to theoretical predictions. Testing a soil-foundation system helped the students identify the lab experiments needed to analyse and design the system. A survey was used to gauge students' perceptions of learning as a result of introducing the module, which were found to be positive. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","civil engineering; engineering education; geosciences; Internet applications; remote access laboratories","Centrifuge facilities; Geosciences; Internet application; Real-time video monitoring; Remote access laboratories; Shallow foundations; Visual observations; Web-based technologies; Centrifuges; Civil engineering; Engineering education; Experiments; Geologic models; Geotechnical engineering; Internet; Soil testing; Students; Integration testing","Amaratunga, K., Sudarshan, R., A Virtual Laboratory for Real-Time Monitoring of Civil Engineering Infrastructure (2002) Proceedings of international conference on engineering education (CD-ROM), , Manchester, UK, International Network for Engineering Education and Research (INEER), Arlington, VA, April 14-18; Arduino, P., Miller, G.R., Ogurinde, A., Live Modeling of 1-D Wave Propagation in Layered Soil Media (2002) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 9 (4), pp. 248-258. , doi:10.1002/cae.10003; Balamuralithara, B., Woods, P.C., Virtual Laboratories in Engineering Education: The Simulation Lab and Remote Lab (2008) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 17 (1), pp. 108-118. , doi:10.1002/cae.20186; Budhu, M., Virtual Laboratories for Engineering Education (2002) Proceedings of international conference on engineering education (CD-ROM), , Manchester, UK, International Network for Engineering Education and Research (INEER), Arlington, VA, April 14-18; Caicedo, B., Geotechnical Centrifuge Applications to Foundation Engineering Teaching (2000) Proceedings of the first international conference on geotechnical engineering education and training, pp. 271-274. , Sinaia, Romania, June 12-14, Balkema, Rotterdam; Craig, W.H., Use of a Centrifuge in Geotechnical Engineering Education (1989) ASTM Geotechnical Testing Journal, 12 (4), pp. 288-291. , doi:10.1520/GTJ10986J; Dewoolkar, M.M., Goddery, T., Znidarcic, D., Centrifuge Modeling for Undergraduate Geotechnical Engineering Instruction (2003) Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 26 (2), pp. 201-209; Elgamal, A., Fraser, M., McMartin, F., On-Line Educational Shake Table Experiments (2005) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 131 (1), pp. 41-49. , doi:10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2005)131:1(41); Ferguson, E.S., (1992) Engineering and the Mind's Eye, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: MIT Press; Kolb, D.A., Learning Styles and Disciplinary Differences (1981) The Modern American College: Responding to the new realities of diverse students and a changing society, pp. 232-255. , In: Chickering A.

The central learning goals of engineering EFFECTs are to (i) improve the understanding and retention of a specific set of concepts that provide core knowledge and (ii) encourage students to recognise and develop critical thinking skills that lead to growth in engineering judgement. The practice of geotechnical engineering deals with complex and uncertain soil conditions, where critical thought and judgement are imperative. Three geo-EFFECTs were created in the context of levee reconstruction, levee permeability, and settlement of a tower structure. Students often provided inaccurate estimates to driving questions set in those contexts; when given opportunities for self-exploration and self-correction in the EFFECT structure, students often achieved more accurate final solutions. Overall, results suggest that EFFECTs have a measurable, positive impact on student learning. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","active learning; critical thinking; deep learning; engineering judgement; estimation; geotechnical education; reflection","Active Learning; Critical thinking; Deep learning; Engineering judgement; Geotechnical; Engineering education; Estimation; Geotechnical engineering; Levees; Reflection; Students","Armstrong, R.J., DeJong, J.T., Yafrate, N.J., Engaging Students with Diverse Learning Styles in Large, Media-Intensive Geotechnical Engineering Classes Using an Integrated Tablet PC - Classroom Communication System Platform (2010) Electronic Journal of Geotechnical Education, 15 (H), pp. 773-794; Bell, S., Galilea, P., Tolouei, R., Student Experience of a Scenario-Centred Curriculum (2010) European Journal of Engineering Education, 35 (3), pp. 235-245. , doi:10.1080/03043791003703169; Berge, N., Flora, J., Engaging Students in Critical Thinking: An Environmental Engineering EFFECT , pp. 1-10. , ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition AC 2010-1752, Louisville, KY, Louisville, KY; Berge, N.D., Pierce, C.E., Using Engineering Problems to Stimulate Critical Thinking in the Middle School Science Classroom ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, Atlanta, Atlanta, GA [forthcoming]; Craig, W.H., Use of a Centrifuge in Geotechnical Engineering Education (1989) Geotechnical Testing Journal, ASTM, 12 (4), pp. 288-291. , doi:10.1520/GTJ10986J; Dewoolkar, M.M., Goddery, T., Znidarcic, D., Centrifuge Modeling for Undergraduate Geotechnical Engineering Instruction (2003) Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 26 (2), pp. 201-209; Dym, C., Agogino, A., Eris, O., Frey, D., Leifer, L., Engineering Design Thinking, Teaching, and Learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, ASEE, 94 (1), pp. 103-120. , doi:10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00832.x; Ellis, G.W., Creating a Learning Environment That Supports Innovation and Deep Learning in Geotechnical Engineering , pp. 1-24. , ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition AC 2012-4267, San Antonio, TX, San Antonio, TX; Facione, P.A., (1998) Critical Thinking: What it is and Why it Counts, , San Jose, CA, San Jose, CA,: California Academic Press; Felder, R.M., Woods, D.R., Stice, J.E., The Future of Engineering Education II: Teaching Methods that Work (2000) Chemical Engineering Education, 34 (1), pp. 26-39; Fiegel, G.L., Successful Laboratory and Field Experiences with Undergraduates and K-12 Students: A Geotechnical Engineering Example , pp. 1-13. , ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition AC 1999-418; Fiegel, G.L., DeNatale, J.S., Hands-On Geotechnical Engineering at the Undergraduate Level , pp. 1-8. , ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition AC 1998-254, Seattle, WA, WA; Hannafin, M.J., Land, S.M., The Foundations and Assumptions of Technology-Enhanced Student-Centered Learning Environments (1997) Instructional Science, 25 (3), pp. 167-202. , doi:10.1023/A:1002997414652; Hanson, J., Kuraoka, S., International Collaboration for Geotechnical Engineering Laboratory Exercises , pp. 1-12. , ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition AC 2008-1531, Pittsburgh, PA, Pittsburgh, PA; Holtz, R.D., Kovacs, W.D., Sheahan, T.C., (2011) An Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering, , 2, Upper Saddle River, NJ, Upper Saddle River, NJ,: Prentice Hall; Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment in the Danube River Basin (2012), International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR), Summary Report on Implementation of Articles 4, 5 and 13(1) of the European Floods Directive in the Danube River Basin District, Document No. IC 166: 37.

However, in the literature, there is no consensus on the equivalence of paper-and-pencil (P&P) and computer-based test (CBT) environments. Additionally, these studies fail to address the engineering domain. Our main assumption is that, if we could define the confounding factors to satisfy that these two versions of the tests provide equivalent results, then especially in the first year courses of the engineering education programs, we could get several benefits of the CBT environments. Accordingly, in this study, students' performance on different test modes was evaluated on 209 first year engineering students of a chemistry course. The results of this study showed that there is no significant performance difference between P&P and CBT. By comparing results with the previous studies, this study concludes that personal characteristics of test takers, the features of CBT systems, and the test content are all possible confounding factors when comparing test modes and need to be considered by the implementers. The results of this study show that once these factors are controlled, students' performance on CBTs and P&P tests in chemistry courses will not vary. This finding is encouraging the educators to get benefits of CBTs without any affect on students' performance. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","computer-based exams; engineering education; paper- and pencil-based exams; test-mode effect","Computer-based exams; Computer-based testing; Computer-based tests; Engineering domains; First year; First-year engineering; Personal characteristics; test-mode effect; Engineering education; Students; Testing","Brown, G., Race, P., Bull, J., (1999) Computer-assisted Assessment in Higher Education, , Kogan Page, London; Ashcroft, K., Palacio, D., (1996) Researching into Assessment and Evaluation in Colleges and Universities, , Kogan Page, London, UK; Shacham, M., Computer-based exams in undergraduate engineering courses (1998) Comp Appl Eng Educ, 6, pp. 201-209; Aydin, C.C., Cagiltay, N.E., How assessment system of an open source learning management system can be integrated to a remote laboratory application?

Integrating face-to-face and online learning, blending can enhance learning and optimize seat time. This paper describes the use of the blended e-learning model in a course ""Data Structures and Algorithms"" given at the Afyon Kocatepe University, Turkey. This model is realized as a combination of a face-to-face environment and online learning, using the University's Learning Management System (LMS) named @KU-UZEM. The LMS consists of many applications in accordance with SCORM standards, such as, student records, user roles, courses, exams security applications, student affairs, counseling services, internal communication, director processes and evaluation. It provides whole software infrastructure by a virtual academic institution and is currently used in Afyon Kocatepe University. This paper describes both the technology for course design and programme redesign adopted a blended learning approach with both face-to-face and online learning aimed at enhancing the students' control over their own learning. According to the obtained results with the performed experimental evaluation, the realized blended learning model provided more effective and efficient educational experience rather than traditional, face-to-face learning. A survey conducted at the end of the course also showed that students were satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements were also better than expected. Particularly important is that the dropout rate was greatly diminished, which could be related to students' satisfaction with the support they received from the teacher and the system. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","blended learning; e-learning; educational technology; learning management system (LMS); web-based education system","Blended learning; Educational experiences; Experimental evaluation; Internal communications; Learning management system; Software infrastructure; Students' satisfaction; Web-based education systems; Blending; Computer programming; Curricula; Data structures; Education computing; Educational technology; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; E-learning","McCormack, C., Jones, D., (1997) Building A Web-based Education System, , Wiley, New York; Hoic-Bozic, N., Vornar, V., Boticki, I., A blended learning approach to course design and implementation (2009) IEEE Trans Educ, 52, pp. 19-30; Greenberg, G., Distance education technologies: Best practices for K-12 settings (1998) IEEE Technol Soc Mag, 17, pp. 36-40; Passerini, K., Granger, M.J., A developmental model for distance learning using the Internet (2000) Comput Educ, 34, pp. 1-15; Keegan, D., (2004) Foundations of Distance Education, , Routledge, New York; Kaya, Z., (2002) Distance Education, , PegemA, Ankara; Akkoyunlu, B., Soylu, M., A study on students' views on blended learning environment (2006) Turk Online J Dist Educ, 7, pp. 43-56; Clark, R.T., Mayer, R.E., (2003) E-learning and the Science of Instruction, , Pfeiffer, San Francisco; (2007) Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: The E-Learning Action Plan, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2001/com2001_0172en01.pdf, European Commission, (Mar. 2001), Nov; Berge, Z.L., Yi-Ping, H., (2004) A Model for Sustainable Student Retention: A Holistic Perspective on the Student Dropout Problem with Special Attention to E-learning, , http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews13_5.pdf, DEOSNEWS, 13, no. 5, May; Developing on-line collaboration (2000) Web-based Learning and Teaching Technologies - Opportunities and Challenges, pp. 226-244. , E.

In order to prepare the students for engineering practice or graduate school, the undergraduate engineering curriculum needs to provide sufficient exposure to computational methods during the 4-year undergraduate education. This paper summarizes the introduction of freshman students to finite element modeling as a part of a hands-on multidisciplinary project-based course. The project focuses on improving students' understanding of structural behavior through experimental and computational methods. The goals of implementing finite element modeling in this project are to enhance the mechanics understanding of students, to increase the students' interest in engineering, and to introduce computational methods to undergraduate students at an early stage during their undergraduate education. The incorporation of finite element modeling in the project provides a powerful tool to visualize the theoretical concepts that are new to the freshman level students such as stress and strain and help to improve their understanding of the experimental observations made in the laboratory setting. The student evaluations show that the finite element modeling part of the project is intellectually stimulating and leads to development of new knowledge and skills. The exposure of freshman students to finite element modeling through a project-based course is expected to help their development as engineers and increase their preparedness for engineering practice or graduate school after graduation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","beam bending; finite element modeling; freshman engineering curriculum; mechanics","Beam bending; Engineering practices; Experimental observation; Finite element modeling; Freshman engineering; Undergraduate education; Undergraduate engineering; Undergraduate students; Computational methods; Curricula; Engineering education; Finite element method; Mechanics; Students","Álvarez-Caldas, C., García, J.L.S.R., Abella, B.M., González, A.Q., Educational software to design shafts and analyze them by fem (2007) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 15, pp. 99-106; Jenkins, H., Mahaney, J., Improving mechanical design education using solid modeling and finite element analysis modules (2005) ASEE Southeastern Section Conference; Lagoudas, D.C., Whitcomb, J.D., Miller, D.A., Lagoudas, M.Z., Shryock, K.J., Continuum mechanics in a restructured engineering undergraduate curriculum (2000) Int J Eng Educ, 16, pp. 301-314; Smolinski, P., Hake, R., Onipede, D., Miller, M.C., Computational and experimental dynamics project for an integrated engineering curriculum (2001) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 9, pp. 1-7; Zhao, J., Computer application in solving statically determinate truss problems using fea and matlab (2009) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 17, pp. 363-371; Brinson, L.C., Belytschko, T., Moran, B., Black, T., Design and computational methods in basic mechanics courses (1997) J Eng Educ, 86, pp. 159-166; Ryan, R.G., (2004) Using A Finite Element Stress Analysis Program to Enhance Learning in A Machine Design Course, , American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Steif, P.S., Gallagher, E., Transitioning students to finite element analysis and improving learning in basic courses (2004) 34th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference; Howard, W.E., Musto, J.C., Prantil, V., Finite element analysis in a mechanics course sequence (2001) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Lissenden, C.J., Wagle, G.S., Salamon, N.J., Applications of finite element analysis for undergraduates (2002) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Ryan, R.G., Prince, S.P., Development of engineering case studies for integrating finite element analysis into a mechanical engineering curriculum (2005) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Baker, J.R., Capece, V.R., Lee, R.J., Integration of finite element software in undergraduate engineering courses (2001) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Pike, M., Introducing finite element analysis in statics (2001) American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition; Carr, J.B., Pilkington, D.F., Barlow, M.I., Design and implementation of a finite element system for education use (1989) Int J Eng Educ, 17, pp. 7-10; (2009) Teaching Edition, Version 6.9, , ABAQUS, Simulia, Providence, RI","Ural, A.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, 800 Lancaster Avenue, Villanova, PA 19085, United States; email: ani.ural@villanova.edu",10613773,,CAPEE,"English","Comput Appl Eng Educ",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876117539

By integrating a live-deployment environment such as PlanetLab into distributed-systems courses, software implementations developed by students can interact with instructors' implementations in a real Internet-distributed scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experience regarding the use of the PlanetLab nodes available over Internet to teach distributed computing concepts to engineering students, since most of the existing literature on distributed-systems courses describes only learning experiences in lab-simulated or lab-emulated scenarios. As discussed in this paper, experimenting with a real laboratory over the Internet adds some complexity to students' practical activities, but it also facilitates a deeper and more intensive learning experience. A survey among students shows some clear benefits of this approach over the use of simulation labs, as well as some pitfalls that must be avoided whenever possible. The paper ends with a set of recommendations for instructors that might want to design similar courses as well as with an overview of future work to be performed in this field. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","distributed systems; engineering education; Internet; PlanetLab; real laboratories","Distributed systems; Engineering course; Learning experiences; PlanetLab; Planetlab nodes; Software implementation; Curricula; Engineering education; Laboratories; Students; Teaching; Internet","Calvo, I., Marcos, M., Orive, D., Sarachaga, I., Building complex remote learning laboratories (2010) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 18, pp. 53-66; Oppenheimer, D., Albrecht, J., Patterson, D., Vahdat, A., Distributed resource discovery on PlanetLab with SWORD (2004) First Workshop on Real, Large Distributed Systems (WORLDS '04); Albrecht, J., Tuttle, C., Snoeren, A.C., Vahdat, A., PlanetLab application management using plush (2006) SIGOPS Oper Syst Rev, 40, pp. 33-40; Balamuralithara, B., Woods, P.C., Virtual laboratories in engineering education: The simulation lab and remote lab (2008) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 17, pp. 108-118; Achalakul, T., Sirinaovakul, B., Nuttaworakul, N., Virtual laboratory: A distributed collaborative environment (2004) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 12, pp. 44-53; Kayssi, A., Sharafeddine, S., Karaki, H., Computer-based laboratory for data communications and computer networking (2004) Comput Appl Eng Educ, 12, pp. 84-97; White, B., Lepreau, J., Stoller, L., Ricci, R., Guruprasad, S., Newbold, M., Hibler, M., Joglekar, A., (2002) An Integrated Experimental Environment for Distributed Systems and Networks, pp. 255-270. , Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Impl.

In this paper, we are proposing a curricular model, the Synthesis and Design Studio, to combat the tendency towards fragmented curricula. The approach proposed here attempts to negotiate the realities of fragmented curricula by providing an integrative learning component that exposes Environmental Engineering students to open-ended projects with the intent that students will develop an integrated understanding of their courses, lives, and professional futures. The pedagogical features and theoretical design of the Studios will be described. Project-led research was conducted, and results from this interpretive analysis of reflections and focus group transcripts are described to explore students' accounts of both content- and meta-level integration as they participated in a Studio.","Integrated curricula; Studio; Trans-disciplinary","Design studios; Engineering curriculum; Environmental engineering students; Integrative learning; Open-ended projects; Pedagogical features; Theoretical design; Trans-disciplinary; Design; Engineering education; Students; Studios; Teaching; Curricula","Criteria for accrediting engineering programs (2004), ABET.

Rather than sitting in traditional lectures, students work in teams to complete worksheets that guide them through the process of learning. The instructor's role in this class is to act as a facilitator of learning. In this way students are actively engaged in processing the information and have the opportunity to utilize and develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and critical thinking. Assessment of this approach was conducted using formal and informal qualitative data, which revealed important elements of implementation that are needed in order to improve student learning when using this approach.","Active learning; Guided inquiry; POGIL","Active Learning; Critical thinking; Guided inquiry; Pedagogical approach; POGIL; Process of learning; Qualitative data; Student learning; Students; Engineering education","Abraham, M.R., Renner, J.W., The sequence of learning cycle activities in high school chemistry (1986) Journal of Research in Science Teaching no, 23 (2), pp. 121-143; Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D.R., (2000) A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, , Boston: Allyn and Bacon; Bessey, C.E., (1889) The essentials of botany, , New York: Henry Holt and Company; Bloom, B.S., Engelhart, M.D., Furst, E.J., Hill, W.H., Krathwohl, D.R., (1956) Taxonomy of educational objectives: The classification of educational objectives, , Handbook I: Cognitive domain.

We hypothesize that the flexible, individualized nature of EPs makes them suitable assessment tools for graduate engineering programs, which are likewise flexible and individualized. Our investigation resulted in a systematic design process that can be used to create EP systems for graduate programmatic assessment. The process was used to develop EP assessment systems for three different engineering graduate programs. Results indicate that (1) the end products, the EP assessment systems, were directly affected by the graduate programs' culture and vision of graduate engineering assessment, and that (2) EPs are flexible based on departmental or program needs. Therefore, we conclude that EPs are appropriate for assessment in graduate engineering programs and that a systematic process of development can be used.","Assessment; ePortfolio design; Graduate programs","Assessment; Comprehensive designs; E-portfolios; Engineering assessments; Engineering graduate programs; Engineering program; Graduate program; Systematic process; Engineering; Students; Engineering education","Backlund, J., Handberg, L., Stringer, J., Nash, J., Gustafsson, J., Lunsford, A., Chen, H., Cannon, D., Personal learning portfolios: Folio thinking (2001) Proposal to The Wallenberg Global Learning Network Funding Program; Balaban, I., Bubas, G., Educational potential of the ePortfolio systems: Students evaluations of Mahara and Elgg (2010) Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces, pp. 329-336. , In V.

The target population included a second-year undergraduate engineering course in the School of Materials Engineering at Purdue University. The objectives of the study were to help students (i) understand the atomic-level processes that govern plastic deformation in metals, and (ii) develop a more intuitive understanding of how materials look and behave in atomic scales. The treatment consisted of traditional lectures followed by inquiry-based simulation lab activities powered by research-grade computational tools. Two lectures by the instructor reviewed the topic of plastic deformation and presented the basic physics of modeling MD to provide a description of materials with atomic resolution of the forces. Next, the students used a simulated laboratory experience to conduct several inquiry activities using fully interactive online MD simulations. Students needed to use the visualizations provided by the simulation to evaluate the atomic processes responsible for plastic deformation of materials and they computed values of various materials properties. Our first analysis compared differences between students who attended one or two lectures and those who attended no lectures. The results showed that participation in the background and/or pre-laboratory lectures supported student abilities to recall specific facts and behavior of materials explicitly taught during instruction. The lectures did not prepare most students for transferring what they had learned in the lecture or prelab lectures to problems they had not previously encountered, but were first presented in the laboratory.activities. However, most students who participated in the laboratory experience demonstrated the ability to transfer what they had learned to predict how an unfamiliar material would behave at the molecular level. This instructional approach can be generalized to other learning experiences designed to help students apply abstract fundamental engineering principles to evaluate a larger context of unfamiliar situations.","Materials; Molecular dynamics; Simulations","Conceptual understanding; Engineering principles; Intuitive understanding; Laboratory experiences; Materials engineering; Molecular dynamics simulations; Simulations; Undergraduate engineering course; Atoms; Engineering education; Laboratories; Materials; Materials properties; Molecular dynamics; Plastic deformation; Students","Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.

However, the faculty and staff effort and physical resources required for the number of students enrolled can be daunting and affect the quality of instruction. To reduce these costs, ensure a high quality educational experience, and reduce variability in student outcomes that occur with individual design projects, we developed a simulation of engineering professional practice, NephroTex, in which teams of students are guided through multiple design-build-test cycles by a mentor in a virtual internship. Here we report on the design process for the virtual internship and results of testing with first-year engineering students at a large, public university. Our results demonstrate that the novel virtual internship successfully educated and motivated first-year-engineering students. Importantly, the virtual environment captures rich discourse that can be used to assess the process of student learning with tools from existing learning theory.","Engineering education; Epistemic frame; Learning sciences; Virtual internship","Educational experiences; Engineering professionals; Epistemic frame; First-year engineering; Learning science; Professional practices; Quality of instructions; Virtual internship; Engineering education; Students; Virtual reality; Cost engineering","Dym, C., Learning Engineering: Design, Languages and Experiences (1999) Journal of Engineering Education, 88 (2), pp. 145-148; Dally, J.W., Zhang, G.M., A Freshman Engineering Design Course (1994) Journal of Engineering Education, 83 (2), pp. 83-91; Froyd, J.E., Ohland, M.W., Integrated engineering curricula (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 147-164; Quinn, R.G., Drexel's E4 Program: A Different Professional Experience for Engineering Students and Faculty (1993) Journal of Engineering Education, 82 (4), pp. 196-202; Dym, C.L., Teaching Design to Freshmen: Style and Content (1994) Journal of Engineering Education, 83 (4), pp. 303-310; Dym, C.L., Little, P., Engineering design: A Project-based Introduction, , (2nd ed.).

The Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC3), as an industrybased credentialing program, utilizes CPS and has been recognized by the Certification Recognition Program of the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) in the US. The CPS, as an individualized learning plan, gears to guide learners through the learning process of pre-assessment, training, practice tests, and portfolio management. The study is to examine whether there are differential effects on computer competency and performance, specifically taking into account gender and types of enrolled program in relation to career and technical education. Our research addresses whether the gender-related differences along with enrolled programs and levels of study differ in performance of information and communications technologies (ICT) including the aspects of Computer Fundamentals (CF), Key Applications (KA), and Living Online (LO). A total of 185 university students were randomly assigned to participate in the CPS and encouraged to take a series of certifying exams. In addition to the official certifying exams, the participants took the CPS which focuses on the three learning processes, i.e.; preassessment, training, practice tests. The results showed that gender-related differences exist in all three aspects of ICT performance. In terms of levels of study (LS), differences existed only in the aspects of CF and LO. Various types of enrolled programs (i.e. day program, evening program, weekend program) differ in all the three aspects (i.e.; CF, KA, LO).

In the absence of an established subject philosophy Technology educators had little alternative than to base their professional teaching and learning practices on approaches from other fields of knowledge and to adapt these. TE is one of the compulsory subjects for learners in South Africa from grade 4-9 since 1998. One of the challenges was the fact that no previous teacher training programmes existed for Technology thus new ones had to be developed. This research described what the necessary knowledge, skills and values are that a qualified Technology teacher should possess and determined if teacher training institutions in South Africa provide opportunities to develop this qualities. Qualitative research was used to provide insight into the nature of pre-service Technology training programmes in South Africa, in order to identify shortcomings in the pre-service training of Technology teachers. The population consisted of senior faculty who have experience in the developing of pre-service training programmes and the training of Technology teachers. Findings of the study suggest a greater focus on the training of Technology teachers as subject specialists by establishing standards that is appropriate for tertiary training in order to enhance the development of subject knowledge; subject specific pedagogical content knowledge by implementing micro lessons; revision of time, planning and facilities for the practising of subject skills; and sufficient opportunities to practise, analyse and reflect on teaching processes to develop appropriate teaching strategies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Effective teaching; Pre-service teacher training; Programme development; Teacher development; Technology education","Effective teaching; Pre-service teacher training; Programme development; Teacher development; Technology education; Engineering education; Teaching; Technology; Personnel training","Anderson, G., Arsenault, N., (2000) Fundamentals of Educational Research, , 2 Falmer Press London; Ankiewicz, P., De Swardt, E., Engelbrecht, W., Technology education in South Africa since 1998: A shift from contents (conceptual knowledge) to process-based learning (1998) PATT 15 Technology Education and Research: Twenty Years in Retrospect; Baily, C.A., (2005) A Guide to Qualitative Field Research, , 2 Pine Forge Press Thousand Oaks; Banks, F., Developing professional knowledge during initial design and technology teacher education (1996) Journal of Design and Technology Education, 1 (2), pp. 175-178; Banks, F., Barlex, D., Jarvinen, E.M., O'Sullivan, G., Owen-Jackson, G., Rutland, M., DEPTH - Developing professional thinking for technology teachers: An international study (2004) International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 14 (2), pp. 141-157. , 10.1023/B:ITDE.0000026475.55323.01; Barlex, D., Perspectives on departmental organization and childrens' learning through the Nuffield design and technology project (2000) Teaching and Learning Design and Technology, pp. 91-103. , J.

The purpose is to reflect on how far the field has come and where it might go to, including what questions need to be considered in its ongoing development. The data for this paper draw on our work in developing The International Handbook of Research and Development in Technology Education (Jones and de Vries 2009). However, the paper is more than a summary of this work, instead representing a synthesis in its own right. The work was not undertaken to report solely on the collective achievement of a large number of people internationally, but rather to use this as a means for setting a sound foundation for future research, development and teaching in technology education. By considering the underlying philosophy, international development of curriculum, relationships of technology education with other subject areas, teaching, learning and assessment as well as teacher education, and educational research, we are able to scope past activities and present an agenda for moving forward in teaching, research and development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Classroom research; Philosophy of technology; Teacher education; Technology education","Educational research; International development; Look-forward; Number of peoples; Philosophy of technology; Research and development; Teacher education; Technology education; Curricula; Research; Teaching; Technology; Engineering education","Banks, F., Research on teaching and learning in technology education (2009) International Handbook of Research and Development in Technology Education, pp. 373-390. , A.T.

A key focus in Stage Two was the trialing of different teaching strategies to determine how learning related to the components Characteristics of Technology (CoT) and Characteristics of Technological Outcomes (COTO) could be supported. These components fall within the Nature of Technology (NoT) strand of technology in the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) (Ministry of Education, 2007) and as such, reflect a philosophical understanding of technology as a discipline. During this stage of the research further exploration was undertaken to determine how student understanding of these two components of technology education progressed from level 1 to level 8 of the NZC (Ministry of Education, 2007). Common misconceptions and partial understandings related to these components are identified and explained and four case studies are presented to illustrate strategies employed by teachers and their impact on student learning related to these two components. The Stage Two outcomes resulted in the revision of the Indicators of Progression for CoT and CoTO in order to clarify the progression expected of students in each component and provide increased teacher guidance to support such progression. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Characteristics of technological outcomes; Characteristics of technology; Common misconceptions; Indicators of progression; Partial understandings; Philosophy of technology","Characteristics of technological outcomes; Common misconceptions; Ministry of Education; Partial understandings; Philosophy of technology; Teaching and learning; Technological knowledge; Technology education; Curricula; Philosophical aspects; Research; Students; Engineering education","Alexander, P.A., The development of expertise: The journey from acclimation to proficiency (2003) Educational Researcher, 32 (8), pp. 10-14. , 10.3102/0013189X032008010; Alexander, P.A., The path to competence: A lifespan developmental perspective on reading (2006) Journal of Literacy Research, 37, pp. 413-436. , 10.1207/s15548430jlr3704-1; Compton, V.J., (2007) A New Technological Literacy.

Generally, the accreditation criteria call for the graduates from engineering programs to demonstrate a range of skills, from technical problem solving to soft skills and an aptitude for lifelong learning. In order to comply with these criteria, accreditation schemes are adopted as a quality assurance measure. This paper shall introduce the characteristics of the engineering accreditation scheme in Malaysia. The impact of the accreditation scheme on the quality of these engineering programs shall be evaluated. Data collection is in the form of benchmarking and questionnaires. The evaluation criteria shall be in terms of benefits to the institution, academic faculty, students, and the challenges encountered. A discussion on the evaluation shall include the supposed dichotomies which arise from this accreditation process, namely the compromise between research versus teaching; and the value of engineering knowledge whether as an academic pursuit or catering to industry's needs. Ultimately, this paper shall address a fundamental question related to undergraduate teaching in engineering: whether accreditation is a necessary prerequisite in maintaining high standards in engineering programs in Malaysia. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accreditation; Engineering education; Outcome Based Education; Quality assurance","Accreditation criteria; Accreditation process; Engineering accreditation; Engineering knowledge; Evaluation criteria; Outcome-based education; Undergraduate engineering course; Undergraduate teaching; Accreditation; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Quality assurance; Surveys; Quality control","Abdullah, H., Che Rose, R., Kumar, N., Human resource strategies: The Malaysian scenario (2007) Journal of Social Science, 3 (4), pp. 213-222; (2005) Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, , http://www.abeek.or.krb, ABEEK Last Accessed Nov 2010; Criteria for accrediting engineering programs, effective for evaluation during the 2009-2010 accreditation cycles (2008) ABET Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, , http://www.abet.org, Baltimore, MD Last Accessed Nov 2010; Brennan, J., (2004) The Social Role of the Contemporary University: Contradictions, Boundaries and Change.

Examples include rules of thumb based on experience, but also models based on obsolete science or folk theories. Centrifugal forces, heat and cold as substances, and sucking vacuum all belong to the latter group. These models contradict scientific knowledge, but are useful for prediction in limited contexts and they are used for this when convenient. Engineers' work is a common prototype for the pupils' work with product development and systematic problem solving during technology lessons. Therefore pupils should be allowed to use the engineers' non-scientific models as well as scientific ones when doing design work in school technology. The acceptance of the non-scientific models for action guidance could be experienced as contradictory by pupils and teachers alike: a model that is allowed, or even encouraged in technology class is considered wrong when doing science. To account for this, different epistemological frameworks must be used in science and technology. Technology is first and foremost what leads to useful results, not about finding the truth or generally applicable laws.

It aims to develop a broad technological literacy through students participating in programmes in which the practice of technological development is experienced, as is knowledge informing practice, and students gain an understanding of technology as a domain in its own right. In New Zealand children begin school at 5 years of age and this paper describes a classroom research project during which these students design and then construct a photo frame. The inducement for this development arose from students needing to safely transport home and then display a class photograph. This provided the opportunity for developing technological knowledge and skills within a real and relevant context - two key drivers when working with young students (Ministry of Education 2007) [MoE]. The results of this project suggest that teaching technology to five-year-old students is achievable and a valuable addition to other learning opportunities provided in the new entrant classroom. Strategies are suggested that will enable students to successfully achieve their goals whilst gaining a simple understanding of the technological process. By making good use of these it is possible to create a worthwhile and imaginatively challenging activity that reflects the essence of the technology education curriculum. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Design; Drawings; Five-year-old students; Primary; Technology","Ministry of Education; Primary; Teaching technologies; Technological development; Technological knowledge; Technological literacy; Technological process; Technology education; Curricula; Design; Drawing (graphics); Driver training; Engineering education; Photography; Technology; Students","Baynes, K., The basis of designerly thinking in young students (1992) Looking, Making and Learning: Art and Design in the Primary School, pp. 70-85. , A.

This article describes experiences and challenges of team building of these students who are called 'teampreneurs' during their first year as team entrepreneurs. The findings provided here are based on theme-based interviews and direct observations. The team learning experiences gained during their first year were related to lack of risks and challenges in team building. Previous studies related to team development suggest that cooperation and conflict, and also openness and confrontation, are essential elements for team development. Based on the findings, teampreneurs of Icaros were avoiding confrontation and conflict. These facts inhibited their development to a potential team and they were stuck in the pseudo-team stage with several parallel challenges. Later, after four teampreneurs decided to leave the Icaros cooperative, it created a crisis within the team and the Icaros was able to further develop as a team. The results suggest that team building needs lots of time and patience and cannot be hurried. Furthermore, the role of team coach is crucial in supporting the teampreneurs to confront their challenges related to relationships between each other within the team. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","cooperative; qualitative research; team development; team learning; teampreneur","cooperative; Qualitative research; Team development; Team learning; teampreneur; Education; Engineering education; Information technology","Argyris, C., Schön, D., (1996) Organizational learning II: Theory, Method and Practice, , Reading, MA, Reading, MA,: Addison Wesley; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of Qualitative Research 3 e: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2003) Collecting and Interpreting Qualitative Materials, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Easterby-Smith, M., Burgoyne, J., Araujo, L., (1999) Organizational Learning and the Learning Organization, , In: Easterby-Smith M., Burgoyne J., Araujo L., editors London, London,: Sage; Flick, U., (2009) An Introduction to Qualitative Research, p. 4. , London, London,: Sage; Isaacs, W., (1999) Dialogue: The Art of Thinking Together, , New York, New York,: Doubleday; Katzenbach Jon, R., Smith, K.D., (1993) The Wisdom of Teams.

Capstone projects are included in engineering curricula to integrate multi-disciplinary subjects and teach professional skills that are difficult to impart in a traditional lectured course. Since these projects serve to transition students into professional engineers, they have a direct impact on a university's industry reputation and ranking. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the capstone programmes implemented at the world's top-ranked engineering universities to discover common elements which characterise them. In this paper, common elements of the capstone programmes implemented in mechanical and aerospace engineering undergraduate programmes in the world's top-ranked engineering universities are identified and analysed to determine established best practices. These practices can be modelled and applied to the pedagogy of engineering programmes at universities around the world to improve the development of professional skills of future graduates. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","capstone;

However, there are many complex concepts and formulas to be covered, and this makes it difficult for students to grasp the spirit of engineering mechanics. One way to solve this problem is to use the analogy study method in learning. Following this new route, students can find the linear quantities and angular quantities in theoretical mechanics, and some analogous relations between stress and deformation for fundamental deformations in mechanics of materials. Through these analogy relations, students can appreciate the essence of different physical phenomena. Indeed, it seems that twice as much is accomplished with half the effort.©Manchester University Press.","analogy; engineering mechanics; mechanics of materials; similarity; theoretical mechanics","Bridges; Deformation; Students; Education; Mechanics; analogy; Engineering mechanics; Mechanics of materials; Physical phenomena; similarity; Specialized knowledge; Stress and deformation; Study methods; Engineering education; Stresses","Timoshenko, S., Gere, J.M., (1972) Mechanics of Materials, , Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., New York; Zheng, Z.M., Thoughts of hsue-shen tsien on engineering sciences: In memory of Hsue-Shen Tsiens 100th anniversary (2011) Chin.

Its focus is instructors' concerns in teaching design, as well as scaffolding strategies that can help teachers deal with these concerns. Through participatory action research, nine instructors engaged in a process of development and instruction of a curriculum about energy along with engineering design. A 50-h curriculum was piloted during a summer camp for 38 middle-school students. Data was collected through instructors' materials: observation field notes, daily reflections and post-camp discussions. In addition, students' artifacts and planning graphical models were collected in order to explore how instructors' concerns were aligned with students' learning. Findings indicate three main tensions that reflect instructors' main concerns: how to provide sufficient scaffolding yet encourage creativity, how to scaffold hands-on experiences that promote mindful planning, and how to scaffold students' modeling practices. Pedagogical strategies for teaching design that developed through this work are described, as well as the ways they address the National Research Council (A framework for K-12 science education: practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas.

The J. B. Speed School of Engineering at the University of Louisville in Kentucky started a K-12 outreach program with the specific goal of increasing the number of students interested in, and capable of, studying STEM fields in college. To achieve this, Speed School developed and implemented a plan to create STEM pipelines in the local Jefferson County Public School (JCPS) system. The pipelines are currently comprised of selected elementary and middle schools that feed students to high schools with Project Lead the Way (PLTW) preengineering curricula. Elementary schools in the pipeline use the Engineering is Elementary (EiE) curriculum developed by the Boston Museum of Science (BMOS). Middle schools in the pipeline use the In the Middle of Engineering (IME) program, developed in collaboration with middle school science teachers. After four years, programs are in place at fifteen participating schools with over 2,000 students involved. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Engineering education; K-12; Outreach; Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)","Elementary and middle schools; Global competitiveness; K-12; K-12 outreach programs; Outreach; Pre-engineering curricula; Science , technology , engineering , and maths; University of Louisville; Chemical contamination; Competition; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Pipelines; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Students","Boisseau, R., (2008) 'Engineering Is Elementary' on the Hill, , http://www.aip.org/fyi/2008/097.html#, (Nov. 1, 2008); Brophy, S., Klein, S., Portsmore, M., Rogers, C., Advancing engineering education in P-12 classrooms (2008) J.

We adopt the perspective that product development is an engineering and social activity aimed to satisfy human needs eliminating the negative environmental impact. This definition is delivered in our students through design experiences aimed under a project-oriented design course. This article seeks to give an overview of this project and to summarize the experience of the past two years that has led to improvement in the designing experiences in the capstone project. The project actively uses CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), CAM(Computer Aided Manufacturing),FEM(Finite Element Method) andCAD(Computer Aided Design) software as tools for enhancing the innovative capacity of senior year engineering students. Seniors working collaboratively were asked to design a solar-powered boat while taking hydrodynamic, energy and economic factors into consideration. We showhow computational tools accelerate decision making processes in design while suggesting promising directions for the students to follow. All this is done while adhering to the fundamental principles in engineering that will lead to a feasible solution. Student creativity was channeled appropriately through CFD, FEM, CAM and CAD tools and new ideas were rigorously and rapidly tested at an early stage in the project allowing for a wide exploration of ideas and concepts. An important result of this capstone activity is the realization by the students of the importance of specialized engineering software in achieving a successful design. The objective of this paper is to present and discuss results obtained while observing students work with computer tools as a way to enhance their creativity in the context of developing their senior design project. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Computational tools; Design; Innovation; Prototype; Solar-powered boat","CFD (computational fluid dynamics); Computational tools; Decision making process; Design and construction; FEM (finite element method); Fundamental principles; Prototype; Solar-powered; Boats; Cams; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational methods; Computer aided manufacturing; Curricula; Design; Engineering; Engineering education; Environmental impact; Finite element method; Innovation; Product development; Solar energy; Students; Computer aided design","http://www.abet.org/, American Board of Engineering and Technology, Accessed May 7, 2011; http://www.itesm.mx/, Tecnológico De Monterrey (ITESM), Accessed June 10, 2011; http://www.sacs.org/, Southern Association of College and Schools, Accessed June 2, 2011; http://www.saemexico.org/baja/baja.html, Baja SAE México, Accessed June 12, 2011; Elizalde, H., Rivera-Solorio, I., Pérez, Y., Morales-Menén-Dez, R., Orta, P., Guerra, D., Ramirez, R.A., An educational framework base on collaborative reverse engineering and active learning: A case study (2008) Int.

A systematic, prioritised analysis of forty factors that influence this type of experience and affect the planning, organisation, development and assessment stages, has enabled us to find and formulate nine problems that we deem to be major ones and that are usually repeated, particularly in machine and product development related experiences in the area of Mechanical Engineering. Having selected these most typical problems, we have then established causal relationships by taking account of: the methodology involved, the available resources, the teachers in charge of the experience and the students taking part in it. This has helped us to find and put forward different solutions and to discuss their effects, keeping in mind our team's experience and the information from the studies carried out by teaching staff from other universities. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Active learning;

A list of abilities and knowledge attributes were derived from similar studies and the expectations expressed by professional organizations. Input was received from managers of 75 different companies across a broad range of industries and sizes and 116 engineering graduates regarding the importance and preparation for 57 abilities and knowledge attributes in 10 categories. Each competency was given a priority based on one of three criteria: 50% or more of managers reporting it to be of the highest level of importance, an average rating greater than a cutoff, and a weighted measure of priority incorporating the importance and gap between graduate preparation and needs. The results suggest that, to managers in Chile, the most important non-technical competencies are in the areas of project control, ethics, communications, teamwork, innovation and budgeting. The competencies identified as important were similar to those seen in studies in other countries, but with a greater emphasis on ethics and innovation and less emphasis on quality and customer focus. Amethod for prioritizing the important competencies was also presented. Many initiatives were proposed to improve specific non-technical competencies that graduates need for competing in the Chilean job market. This paper presents the methodology, the findings, the comparisons with results from similar studies in other countries, and the strategies developed as a result of the findings. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Management; Non-technical competencies; Soft skills","Competency gaps; Customer focus; Engineering graduates; Non-technical competencies; Priority-based; Professional organization; Project control; Soft skills; Budget control; Management; Managers; Philosophical aspects; Project management; Engineering education","Palmer, S., An evaluation of undergraduate engineering management studies (2002) International Journal of Engineering Education, 18 (3), pp. 321-330; Palmer, S., Management education in australian engineering undergraduate courses (2000) Engineering Management Journal, 12 (3), pp. 3-9; Meier, R., Williams, M., Humphreys, M., Refocusing our efforts: Assessing non-technical competency gaps (2000) Journal of Engineering Education, 89 (3), pp. 377-385; Fisher, K.J., Lobaugh, M., Parente, D.H., An assessment of desired ""business knowledge attributes"" for engineering technology graduates (2006) Journal of Engineering Technology, 23 (2), pp. 10-15; http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/CodeofEthics/index.html, National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), Code of Ethics, Accessed 5 December 2010; http://prdweb.asq.org/certification/resource/docs/cqe-bok-2006.pdf, American Society for Quality (ASQ), Quality Engineer Certification-Body of Knowledge, Accessed 5 December 2010; (2010) Guide to the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), New York, , American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME); A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide), 4th Edn, , Project Management Institute (PMI), Project Management Institute, Inc., Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, U.S.A; Rogers, G., Surveys and questionnaires:dothey measure up?

Although research and curricular reform efforts have advanced our understanding of what works to attract women to engineering, we still know little from the student perspective as to why some practices are successful in attracting and retaining women. It is not enough to know what works, but we must also know why some practices work in order to create lasting change and reach diversity goals. Our study begins addressing this why question by qualitatively examining eight women participants' choices to enroll in a service-learning course (Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS)) that has been successful in attracting women over 16 years. Our results show that our participants choose EPICS as a way to gain experience doing engineering; that EPICS provides the benefit of contextualized learning with resulting impacts within EPICS and in other classes, and that EPICS positively impacts commitment to engineering. Interpreting our results, we argue that women are seeking ways to gain engineering experience in a setting that is comfortable to them, such as EPICS. The context of the experience and ability to help others is important, but secondary to gaining engineering experience. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Gender; Self-efficacy; Service-learning","Contextualized learning; Curricular reforms; Engineering projects in community services; Gender; Self efficacy; Service learning; Service-learning course; Student perspectives; Engineering education; Professional aspects","Jackson, S.A., (2002) The Quiet Crisis, Building Engineering and Science Talent, , San Diego, CA; (2004), NAE, The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, National Academies Press, Washington, DC; (2005) NAE, Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , National Academies Press, Washington, DC; (2006) Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for A Brighter Economic Future, , National Academies, National Academies Press, Washington, DC; Busch-Vishniac, I.J., Jarosz, J.P., Can diversity in the undergraduate engineering population be enhanced through curricular change?

The need for systematizing the first phase of problem solving activity has led the authors to the development of a dedicated procedure for problem reformulation and the implementation of a dedicated software package, named BOB-UP®. It aims at driving the user to reformulate the initial problem using a dialogue-based system hiding an accurate cause-effect analysis. BOB-UP® provides three tools (Ill-Balls diagram, Fight diagram, and a linguistic composer) that guide step-by-step the user to the right problem formulation. This paper presents the experimentation of such CAI tool within two courses at the University of Bergamo. The first is a compulsory course for the master degree in Mechanical Engineering, while the latter is an elective course for the master degree in Mechanical Engineering and Management Engineering. The experimentation has been carried out with 56 students sub-divided into three groups according to their competences on problem structuring and solving and technical background. We considered five problems related to industrial applications coming from different technological domains to demonstrate the independence of the results from the specific industrial area. Finally, results are discussed presenting advantages and drawbacks. They have been evaluated according to specific criteria to evaluate its usability and efficacy; in addition, students were asked to fill a questionnaire to comprehend the perception they have on BOB-UP® usefulness and potential. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","BOB-UP®; CAI tools; Cause-effect analysis; Engineering education; Problem structuring; TRIZ","Cause-effect analysis; Computer aided tools; Management engineering; Problem reformulations; Problem structuring; Structure engineering; Technical background; TRIZ; Engineering education; Experiments; Industrial applications; Mechanical engineering; Students; Problem solving","Smith, G.F., Towards a heuristic theory of problem structuring (1988) Management Science, 34 (12), pp. 1489-1506; Simon, H.A., The structure of ill structured problems&z.ast; 1 (1973) Artificial Intelligence, 4 (3-4), pp. 181-201; Dewey, J., (1938) Logic: The Theory of Inquiry; Woolley, R.N., Pidd, M., Problem structuring- A literature review (1981) The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 32 (3), pp. 197-206; De Bono, E., (1970) Lateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step, , Harper & Row; Heuvel, L.N.V., (2005) Root Cause Analysis Handbook: A Guide to Effective Incident Investigation, , Rothstein Associates Inc; Miles, L.D., (1972) Techniques of Value Analysis and Engineering, 4. , McGraw-Hill; Gordon, W.J.J., (1961) Synectics: The Development of Creative Capacity, Harper, p. 180. , Oxford, England; Fogler, H.S., Leblanc, S.E., (1995) Strategies for Creative Problem Solving, , Prentice Hall; Shetty, D., And society of manufacturing engineers, design for product success (2002) Society of Manufacturing Engineers; Doggett, A.M., Root cause analysis: A framework for tool selection (2005) Quality Management Journal, 12 (4), p. 34; Chrysler, F., Motors, G., (2001) Failure Mode and Effect Analysis FMEA., , AIAG; Dettmer, H.W., (1997) Goldratt's Theory of Constraints: A Systems Approach to Continuous Improvement, , ASQ Quality Press; Ishikawa, K., Lu, D.J., (1985) What Is Total Quality Control?: The Japanese Way, , Prentice-Hall; Tregoe, B.B., Kepner, C.H., (1981) The New Rational Manager., , Princeton Research Press, Princeton, NJ; Tague, N.R., (2005) The Quality Toolbox, , American Society for Qualit; Paradies, M., (2010) Under Scrutiny, , Quality Progress; Souchkov, V., (2005) Root Conflict Analysis (RCA+): Structuring and Visualization of Contradictions; (1984) Creativity As An Exact Science: The Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems, 1. , Genrikh Saulovich Altshuller, CRC Press; Sarkar, P., Chakrabarti, A., (2009) Analizing Creativity Methods in International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries, ICoRD'09, , Bangalore, India; Khomenko, N., De Guio, R., Lelait, L., Kaikov, I., A framework for OTSM-TRIZ-based computer support to be used in complex problem management (2007) International Journal of Computer Applications in Technology, 30 (1-2), pp. 88-104. , DOI 10.1504/IJCAT.2007.015700; Yezersky, G., General theory of innovation (2007) Trends in Computer Aided Innovation, pp. 45-55; Antonietti, A., Why does mental visualization facilitate problem-solving?

Whereas DBL has been employed in the practice of teaching science in secondary education, it has barely been defined, let alone investigated empirically, at the level of the higher education setting. The purpose of this study is to investigate empirically to what extent pre-defined DBL characteristics are present in an exemplary DBL practice in technical studies. As an exemplary case, we took four different engineering departments from a technical university in which DBL has been implemented as a central form of instruction. First, we conducted a survey to collect teachers' and students' perceptions on whether DBL characteristics were, in fact, present in assignments and projects. Second, teaching materials and student products from three projects were analyzed qualitatively. We found that teachers and students recognized DBL characteristics as part of the instruction, albeit to a varied extent. We found considerable differences between departments, particularly in the characteristics of the projects, the role of the teacher, and the design elements. Analysis ofDBLteaching materials and student products revealed that not all DBL characteristics are embedded in the projects over all departments. Implications for further research are discussed to optimize the instructional design of DBL environments. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Design thinking; Design-based learning; Engineering education; Instructional design","Design thinking; Design-based learning; Educational approach; Engineering department; Innovative solutions; Instructional designs; Practice of teachings; Technical universities; Engineering education; Students; Design","Clough, G., (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering Washington, DC; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18 (1), pp. 32-42; Dym, C.L., Little, P., (2009) Engineering Design:AProject-Based Introduction, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

A particular line of evolution of these systems concern computer coaches, i.e. software applications capable to assist users along each step of design activities. In such perspective the authors have developed a dialogue-based system supporting a natural language questioning procedure to investigate technical problems through TRIZ way of thinking.Anemerging deficiency of its first version concerns limited capabilities in providing a broad screening of the issues and features relevant within the encountered inventive problems. The integration of a further analysis module supporting the logic of the TRIZ System Operator has allowed the individuation of effective resources for breaking technical conflicts inherent to the investigated systems or formalizing contradictions in TRIZ terms. The paper provides further support about the need of developing broad thinking skills in engineering education. The new generation of Computer-Aided systems is extending its scope, by supporting the user already from the early design stages, where creativity and cognitive processes are of paramount importance. In such context, the authors have developed a natural language dialogue-based framework capable to coach designers in investigating non-routine technical problems through a TRIZ way of thinking. The first version of the questioning procedure has showed limitations in terms of the capability to widen the designer's perspective, resulting in the overlooking of aspects relevant for the problem. The new version of the dialogue-based system integrates a further analysis module, here presented, supporting the logic of the TRIZ System Operator. New tests demonstrate that the modification allows to improve the quality of the analyses, especially in terms of the identification of features to be advantageously redesigned in order to solve the addressed problems. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Broad-spectrum investigation; Computer aided innovation; Dialogue-based system; Inventive problem analysis; TRIZ","Broad-spectrum investigation; Computer aided innovation; Dialogue-based system; Inventive problems; TRIZ; Application programs; Computer aided analysis; Conceptual design; Engineering education; Problem solving","Cavallucci, D., Rousselot, F., Zanni, C., Assisting r&d activities through definition of problem mapping (2009) CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 1 (3), pp. 131-136; Barak, M., Mesika, P., Teaching methods for inventive problem-solving in junior high school (2007) Thinking Skills and Creativity, 2 (1), pp. 19-29; Khomenko, N., De Guio, R., Cavallucci, D., Enhancing ecn's abilities to address inventive strategies using otsm-triz (2009) International Journal of Collaborative Engineering, 1 (1-2), pp. 98-113; Ginevicius, R., Gineviciene, V.B., The compliance of master's degree studies with the economic needs of the country (2009) Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 15 (1), pp. 136-153; Funke, J., Frensch, P.A., Complex problem solving: The european perspective (2007) Learning to Solve Complex Scientific Problems, pp. 25-47. , Jonassen D.H.

One of the most important modifications occurred is the integration of the two traditional fields of product design and product engineering into the new concept of industrial Design &Engineering. The consequent shift and the extension of the designer's area of expertise concerning the product development process have led to amplify his typical knowledge: both more and more technical knowledge, and also knowledge more focused on conceptual issues and creativity. This trend is fostered by the intensive use of computer systems and also by various Design &Engineering courses, where it has been possible to experimentally observe the difficulty for students to learn the necessary body of knowledge and to manage a wider product development process. However, the multidisciplinary approach to the product development process and to the related education issues are still based on tools and methods developed for a specific kind of user, or usually used in an unarranged way. The research presented in this paper aims at defining the guidelines for developing an integrated framework to support the Design &Engineering education and the multidisciplinary design process based on a structured integration of knowledge and tools currently used by the two main areas of reference. The paper presents the guidelines for the integrated framework and the experimental activities used for the framework validation. These activities have allowed the authors to check the framework usability during team design activities and also to verify its effectiveness in improving students' learning capabilities.

Our goals were to consider how students' interpretation of task demands could be associated with their use of planning, cognitive, and monitoring/fix-up strategies, both as part of the design process and when managing their time, resources and teamwork. The main research question that guided the study was: In what ways did higher-vs. lower-performing students differ when engaged in an engineering design project? With regards to this question, we specifically explored how these two groups of students were similar or different in their: (1) task interpretation in relation to reported strategy use during the design process; and (2) task interpretation in relation to reported strategy use in project management. Seventy freshman engineering students enrolled in an introductory engineering design course at Utah State University were recruited for the study. From among that group, data from 20 higher-and 12 lower-performers were selected for analysis. Survey instruments and Web-based design journal entries were used to capture students' task interpretation, reported strategy use, including planning (PS), cognitive (CS), and monitoring/fix-up strategies (MF), and perceptions of important performance criteria (CR). Students' design performance was evaluated by the teacher. Descriptive and nonparametric statistics and graphical views were used to analyze student SRL profiles. Entries from students' design journals were coded using an SRL model and interpreted to triangulate and complement survey data to achieve deeper insight about SRL between the two groups. The findings suggested that both higher-and lower-performers were highly aware of important task requirements. However, higherperforming students had a greater awareness and reported greater use of monitoring and fix-up strategies associated with success in the design process. The higher-performing students also obtained higher scores on criteria for performance than lower-performing students, both in the design process and project management. Furthermore, journal writings revealed that higher performers were more thorough in identifying and describing design requirements and strategies for their projects than were the lower performers. This paper discusses the potential implication for design instruction in engineering college freshmen. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Cognitive strategies; College freshmen; Engineering design; Metacognition; Self-regulated learning; Task interpretation","Cognitive Strategy; College freshmen; Engineering design; Metacognition; Self-regulated learning; Task interpretation; Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Project management; Surveys; Students","Zimmerman, B.J., Dimensionsofacademic self-regulation: A conceptual frameworkforeducation (1994) Self Regulation of Learning and Performance: Issues and Educational Applications, pp. 3-21. , D.H.

Age and seniority (academic rank) are both found to affect negatively teaching evaluation, although the effect of rank depends heavily on the discipline. Profession-oriented disciplines are more poorly evaluated and exhibit stronger effects for rank; in the same disciplines, many courses are taught by non-faculty members, who are evaluated poorly. Gender is also found to be relevant, as it affects students' evaluation of female instructors, although this result might be biased by the gender composition of classes. Past research outputs, as measured by an instructor's publication track record, has a positive impact on students' evaluation of teaching effectiveness, although the rate of impact decreases with the amount of publications. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","determinants of teaching effectiveness; economics of education; engineering education; evaluation methodology; teaching effectiveness","Data set; Engineering schools; Evaluation methodologies; Research outputs; Students' evaluations; Teaching effectiveness; Teaching evaluation; Track record; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Economics","Aleamoni, L.M., Graham, M.H., The relationship between CEO ratings and instructor's rank, class size, and course level (1974) Journal of Educational Measurement, 11, pp. 189-202. , doi:10.1111/j.1745-3984.1974.tb00990.x; Aleamoni, L.M., Thomas, G.S., Differential relationships of student, instructor, and course characteristics to general and specific items on a course evaluation questionnaire (1980) Teaching of Psychology, 7 (4), pp. 233-235. , doi:10.1207/s15328023top0704_11; Aleamoni, L.M., Yimer, M., An investigation of the relationship between colleague rating, student rating, research productivity, and academic rank in rating instructional effectiveness (1973) Journal of Educational Psychology, 64 (3), pp. 274-277. , doi:10.1037/h0034584; Amin, M.E., Gender as a discriminating factor in the evaluation of teaching (1994) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 19 (2), pp. 135-143. , doi:10.1080/0260293940190206; Arbuckle, J., Williams, B.D., Students' perceptions of expressiveness: age and gender effects on teacher evaluations (2003) Sex Roles, 49 (9-10), pp. 507-516. , doi:10.1023/A:1025832707002; Basow, S.A., Silberg, N.T., Student evaluation of college professors: are female and male professors rated differently?

Consequently, an essential challenge for engineering organisations wishing to overcome informational silos is to implement mechanisms that facilitate, encourage and sustain interactions between otherwise disconnected groups. This paper acts as a primer for those seeking to gain an understanding of the design, functionality and utility of a suite of software tools generically termed social media technologies in the context of optimising the management of tacit engineering knowledge. Underpinned by knowledge management theory and using detailed case examples, this paper explores how social media technologies achieve such goals, allowing for the transfer of knowledge by tapping into the tacit and explicit knowledge of disparate groups in complex engineering environments. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","knowledge management; social media; teaching case","Complex engineering; Disparate groups; Engineering knowledge; Implement mechanisms; Knowledge management theories; Knowledge transfer; Social media; Tacit and explicit knowledge; Transfer of knowledge; Education; Engineering education; Knowledge management","Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: knowledge management and knowledge management systems: conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-137. , doi:10.2307/3250961; Ajjan, H., Hartshone, R., Buecher, S., Investigating web 2.0 application impacts on knowledge workers' decisions and performance (2012) Information Resources Management Journal, 25 (4), pp. 65-83. , doi:10.4018/irmj.2012100104; Berelowitz, M., (2008) Work in Progress Enterprise 2.0 [online], , http://www.wpp.com/NR/rdonlyres/AC5755D7-3714-412A-B8AF-AD7B58766636/0/WorkinprogressEnterprise20.pdf, Available from: [Accessed 18 January 2010]; Bloom, J., (2008) Chapter 7: The new society - content nation redefines how people live their lives [online], , http://www.contentnation.com/wiki/content-nation-book-chapter-7-society, Available from: [Accessed 18 January 2010]; Boateng, R., Malik, A., Mbarika, V., Web 2.0 and organizational learning: conceptualizing the link [online] http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2009/546, AMCIS 2009 Proceedings, Paper 546.

It builds upon other recent methodology articles in engineering education journals and presents feminist research methodologies as a concrete engineering education setting in which to explore the connections between epistemology, methodology and theory. The paper begins with a literature review that covers a broad range of topics featured in the literature on feminist methodologies. Next, data from interviews with engineering educators and researchers who have engaged with feminist methodologies are presented. The ways in which feminist methodologies shape their research topics, questions, frameworks of analysis, methods, practices and reporting are each discussed. The challenges and barriers they have faced are then discussed. Finally, the benefits of further and broader engagement with feminist methodologies within the engineering education community are identified. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","engineering education research; feminist methodologies; feminist research; gender; methodology","Engineering education research; Engineering educators; feminist methodologies; gender; Literature reviews; methodology; Research methodologies; Research topics; Engineering education; Research","Adams, R., Multiple perspectives on engaging future engineers (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 48-88; Alpay, E., Gender issues in the university research environment (2010) European Journal of Engineering Education, 35 (2), pp. 135-145. , doi:10.1080/03043790903497302; Amelink, C.T., Meszaros, P.S., A comparison of educational factors promoting or discouraging the intent to remain in engineering by gender (2011) European Journal of Engineering Education, 36 (1), pp. 47-62. , doi:10.1080/03043797.2010.531695; Beddoes, K., Problematizations of women's underrepresentation: comparing educator interviews with the literature [online], , http://fie-conference.org/fie2011/papers/1535.pdf, Paper presented at the Frontiers in Education (FIE) annual conference, Washington, DC and Piscataway, NJ, Washington, DC and Piscataway, NJ,: ASEE and IEEE, Available from: [Accessed 28 November 2012]; Beddoes, K., Borrego, M., Feminist theory in three engineering education journals: 1995-2008 (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (2), pp. 281-303; Beddoes, K., Feminist scholarship in engineering education: challenges and tensions (2012) Engineering Studies, 4 (3), pp. 205-232. , doi:10.1080/19378629.2012.693932; Beddoes, K., Pathways of feminist engineering education scholars [online], , http://www.aaee.com.au/conferences/2012/documents/abstracts/aaee2012-submission-37.pdf, Paper presented at the Australasian Association for Engineering Education (AAEE) annual conference, Australasian Association for Engineering Education, Available from: [Accessed 28 November 2012]; Beeman, C., Baillie, C., Learning to think about socio-technical problems in an interdisciplinary context (2007), Paper presented at the 1st International conference on Research in Engineering Education, June, Honolulu, Hawaii; Bergmann, B.R., The task of a feminist economics: a more equitable future (1987) The impact of feminist research in the academy, pp. 131-147. , In: Farnham C., editors Bloomington, IN, Bloomington, IN,: Indiana University Press; Borrego, M., Development of engineering education as a rigorous discipline: a study of the publication patterns of four coalitions (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (1), pp. 5-18; Borrego, M., Douglas, E.P., Amelink, C.T., Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods in engineering education (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (1), pp. 53-66; Bredo, E., Feinberg, W., (1982) Knowledge and values in social and educational research, , In: Bredo E., Feinberg W., editors Philadelphia, PA, Philadelphia, PA,: Temple University Press; Case, J., Light, G., Emerging methodologies in engineering education research (2011) Journal of Engineering Education, 100 (1), pp. 186-210; DeVault, M.L., (1999) Liberating method: Feminism and social research, , Philadelphia, PA, Philadelphia, PA,: Temple University Press; Douglas, E.P., Koro-Ljungberg, M., Borrego, M., Challenges and promises of overcoming epistemological and methodological partiality: advancing engineering education through acceptance of diverse ways of knowing (2010) European Journal of Engineering Education, 35 (3), pp. 247-257. , doi:10.1080/03043791003703177; Du, X., Gendered practices of constructing an engineering identity in a problem-based learning environment (2006) European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (1), pp. 35-42. , doi:10.1080/03043790500430185; Foor, C.E., Walden, S.E., Trytten, D.A., I wish that I belonged more in this whole engineering group': Achieving individual diversity (2007) Journal of Engineering Education, 96 (2), pp. 103-115; Gill, J., I still wanna be an engineer!

The funding of industry-university collaboration is, thus, an inefficient use of university income. In analysing relevant laws, one finds that university fund investments could incubate university owned enterprises. With a technology transfer plan and capital investment, the university owned enterprise business model is a suitable approach for a modern university. The platform constructed by the technology transfer institution, an incubation centre or a science and technology park would further attract established cooperative enterprises and access to government subsidies, as well as the establishment of private universities. Combined with the major school functions of the incubator and the capital investment by the university funds, the university owned enterprise would help to increase the revenue of the university by the effective incubation of the incorporation. © 2012 WIETE.",,"Business models; Capital investment; Cooperative enterprise; Feasibility studies; Government subsidies; Higher education; Industry-university collaboration; Research capacities; Science and technology parks; Economic analysis; Industry; Investments; Technology transfer; Engineering education","(2008), Ministry of Education.

However, the pace of economic, social and technological change has increased the gap between the competences needed by industry and those provided by the universities' curricula. This requires an increasingly integrated approach by academia and industry in order to afford the problem of engineering competences' obsolescence. Framed in the above premises, the aim of this paper is to present the results of a two year postgraduate training program aimed at developing a new archetype of human capital to face the requirements of Intelligent and Sustainable Manufacturing. The case study presented in the paper addresses the needs for providing manufacturing education to meet the challenges in terms of ''who''-the profile for the next generation of manufacturing engineer; ''what''-the new system for education and its contents, and ''how''-innovative learning approaches and strategy to incentive the development of competence. The findings demonstrate the radical innovation in developing the next generation of engineers for Intelligent and Sustainable Manufacturing and the importance of a learning environment that is strictly based on virtuous industry-university partnerships. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Competences;

However, nontechnical professional skills such as communication and interpersonal skills, teamwork, and creative and intuitive thinking skills are also seen as essential for engineers, and especially for leaders. The portfolio practice has proved to be effective in supporting students' learning, as it allows them to document evidence of their learning and to reflect on personal growth. This paper reports a case study on implementation of the portfolio practice in an engineering leadership block curriculum and assessment of students' perceptions of this practice. It also provides implications for advancing engineering education with this approach. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Block curriculum; Engineering education; Engineering leadership development; Portfolio assessment; Student learning and reflection","Engineering leadership; Interpersonal skills; Leadership development; Personal growth; Portfolio assessment; Professional skills; Student learning; Thinking skills; Curricula; Engineering education; Students","Paulson, F.L., Paulson, P.R., Meyer, C.A., What makes a portfolio a portfolio?

The participants in this study were all enrolled in a university-based qualifications recognition program, of which a co-operative education term is one critical component. Data were gathered through focus group interviews, which were designed to obtain their perceptions of the cooperative education experience and its relationship to their career development. Data were interpreted through a theoretical framework of cultural categories and social and cultural capital, with the aim of discerning enabling and disabling aspects of a cooperative education experience to immigrant professionals' career development. Data reveal that the most profound obstacles concerned participants' expectations and competencies in the cultural norms and interactional styles that are unique to the North American professional workplace. The implementation of a professional practice component in the academic portion of the university-based program (prior to cooperative education placement) helped students to develop a heightened awareness of cultural differences in the workplace. The coop term built on this preparation and equipped them with opportunities to recognize and develop social and cultural capital in the Canadian context, relative to the cultivation of professional skills (soft skills) and exposure to mentoring and networking opportunities. Implications are drawn regarding the integration of immigrant professionals and the relationship of findings to other under-represented groups. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Cooperative education; Immigrant engineers; Professional integration; Social and cultural capital","Career development; Co-operative education programs; Cooperative education; Critical component; Cultural difference; Cultural norms; Engineering profession; Exploratory studies; Focus groups; International engineering graduates; North American; Professional practices; Professional skills; Social and cultural capital; Soft skills; Theoretical framework; Under-represented groups; Apprentices; Employment; Engineering education; Integration; Professional aspects","Laroche, L., Rutherford, D., (2007) Recruiting Retaining and Promoting Culturally Different Employees, , Elsevier Inc, Burlington, MA; Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration, 2011, , http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/annual-report-2011/ section2.asp, Online (accessed August 7 2012); Plante, J., (2010) Characteristics and Labour Market Outcomes of Internationally-educated Immigrants, , Culture, Tourism and the Centre for Education Statistics.

One of the key objectives of the Learning Factory was to develop an immersive learning environment resulting in an integrated hands-on and 'heads-on' educational laboratory. One key-challenge was the utilization of the potential of problem-based and action-oriented learning and its transfer to higher education in industrial engineering. The teaching methodology harnesses the advantages of an interdisciplinary, experience-based and applied approach to learning and knowledge transfer, in order to build and hone the key competences of future industrial engineers. This is done in the context of a comprehensive approach to the Product Development Process, spanning the entire genesis of a product from product conception to serial production. Therefore, the pilot course was dubbed the 'integrative Product Emergence Process' (i-PEP).

The question discussed in this research is not whether this transformation is positive or negative. This study aims to discuss the potentialities of Web 2.0 tools in education, observing how it can be used in Engineering Education models. The question that we want to help answer is: How can engineering professors use Web 2.0 tools, for example in a blog, in teaching strategies to create a motivational learning space? A methodology based on collaborative learning was proposed to students in the Industrial Engineering Fundamentals discipline using Web 2.0 tools to evaluate its potential to aid autonomous learning. It was concluded that Web 2.0 tools have a large potential in Engineering Education.

The use of information technology systems and student data by institutions to understand and improve student academic performance is often referred to as 'academic analytics'. This paper presents an academic analytics investigation into the modelling of academic performance of engineering students enrolled in a second-year class. The modelling method used was binary logistic regression, and the target predicted variable was 'success status'-defined as those students from the total originally enrolled group that achieved a final unit grade of pass or better. This paper shows that student data stored in institutional systems can be used to predict student academic performance with reasonable accuracy, and it provides one methodology for achieving this. Importantly, significant predictor variables are identified that offer the ability to develop targeted interventions to improve student success and retention outcomes. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Academic analytics; Binary logistic regression; Engineering education; Student academic performance","Academic analytics; Academic performance; Binary logistic regression; Information technology systems; Modelling method; Predictor variables; Reasonable accuracy; Student success; Engineering education; Information technology; Logistics; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Students","Delen, D., A comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for student retention management (2010) Decision Support Systems, 49 (4), pp. 498-506; Yu, C.H., Digangi, S., Jannasch-Pennell, A., Kaprolet, C., A data mining approach for identifying predictors of student retention from sophomore to junior year (2010) Journal of Data Science, 8 (2), pp. 307-325; Knight, D.W., Carlson, L.E., Sullivan, J.F., Improving engineering student retention through hands-on, team based, first-year design projects (2007) 31st International Conference on Research in Engineering Education, pp. 11-13. , American Society for Engineering Education, Honolulu; Ragusa, G., Lee, C.T., The impact of focused degree projects in chemical engineering education on students' research performance, retention, and efficacy (2012) Education for Chemical Engineers, 7 (3), pp. e69-e77; Jain, R., Shanahan, B., Roe, C., Broadening the appeal of engineering -addressing factors contributing to low appeal and high attrition (2009) International Journal of Engineering Education, 25 (3), pp. 405-418; Tinto, V., FromTheory to action: Exploring the institutional conditions for student retention (2010) Higher Education: Handbook of Theory and Research, 25, pp. 51-89. , Springer, New York; Ohland, M.W., Sheppard, S.D., Lichtenstein, G., Eris, O., Chachra, D., Layton, R.A., Persistence, engagement, and migration in engineering programs (2004) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3), pp. 259-278; Zhang, G., Anderson, T.J., Ohland, M.W., Thorndyke, B.J., Identifying factors influencing engineering student graduation: A longitudinal and cross-institutional study (2004) Journal of Engineering Education, 93 (4), pp. 313-320; Reason, R., Student variables that predict retention: Recent research and new developments (2009) Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice, 46 (3), pp. 482-501; Campbell, J.P., Oblinger, D.G., (2007) Academic Analytics, , EDUCAUSE, Boulder; Caison, A., Analysis of institutionally specific retention research: A comparison between survey and institutional database methods (2007) Research in Higher Education, 48 (4), pp. 435-451; Lonn, S., Teasley, S.D., Saving time or innovating practice: Investigating perceptions and uses of learning management systems (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (3), pp. 686-694; MacFadyen, L.P., Dawson, S., Mining LMS data to develop an 'early warning system' for educators: A proof of concept (2010) Computers & Education, 54 (2), pp. 588-599; Lykourentzou, I., Giannoukos, I., Nikolopoulos, V., Mpardis, G., Loumos, V., Dropout prediction in e-learning courses through the combination of machine learning techniques (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (3), pp. 950-965; Cabrera, A.F., Nora, A., Castaneda, M.B., College persistence: Structural equations modeling test of an integrated model of student retention (1993) The Journal of Higher Education, 64 (2), pp. 123-139; Vogt, C.M., Faculty as a critical juncture in student retention and performance in engineering programs (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (1), pp. 27-36; Hart, C., Factors associated with student persistence in an online program of study: A review of the literature (2012) Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 11 (1), pp. 19-42","Palmer, S.; Faculty of Science and Technology, , Geelong, VIC 3220, Australia; email: spalm@deakin.edu.au",0949149X,,,"English","Int.

This paper describes a case study of K-12 engineering education in which a real-world engineering example is integrated into a computer simulation learning module to improve student understanding of three important concept pairs in high school physics, specifically, in Newtonian mechanics. The three concept pairs include: linear displacement vs. angular displacement, linear velocity vs. angular velocity, linear acceleration vs. angular acceleration. The module has interactive graphical user interfaces requiring student inputs to promote active learning. A total of fifteen high school students participated in the present study. A pre-test, a post-test, and a questionnaire survey were administrated to assess student perceptions about the three concept pairs as well as student learning gains. The coefficients of reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the assessment instruments were 0.937 and 0.969, respectively. Students reported positive experiences with the developed computer simulation module, and stated that, via the use of the simulation learning module, they developed a better understanding of the conceptual difference and the mathematical relationship between two concepts in each concept pair. Students achieved an average learning gain of 46.7%-71.4%. Finally, the present study reveals that the three lowest learning gains are all related to angular quantities: angular displacement, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. This implies that more educational efforts should be made to improve student understanding of these angular quantities. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Computer simulations; K-12 engineering education; Physics; Real-world engineering examples; Student learning gains; Student perceptions","Active Learning; Angular acceleration; Angular displacement; Assessment instruments; Cronbach's alphas; High school; High school students; Improving learning; Interactive graphical user interface; K-12 engineering education; Learning gain; Learning modules; Linear accelerations; Linear displacements; Linear velocity; Mathematical relationship; Newtonian mechanics; Positive experiences; Questionnaire surveys; Real-world; Student learning; Student perceptions; Angular velocity; Computer simulation; Graphical user interfaces; Physics; Students; Engineering education","Katehi, L., Pearson, G., Feder, M., (2009) Engineering in K-12 Education: Understanding the Status and Improving the Prospects, , National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council, Washington, DC; (2010) Standards for K-12 Engineering Education?, , Committee on Standards for K-12 Engineering Education National Academy of Engineering, Washington, DC; Lewis, T., Engineering education in schools (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (5), pp. 843-852; Siller, T.J., De Miranda, M.A., Whaley, D.C., Engineering education partnership (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (1), pp. 58-64; Sorby, S.A., Scumaker-Chadde, J., Partnering to bring engineering concepts to elementary students (2007) International Journal of Engineering Education, 23 (1), pp. 65-72; Thompson, S., Lyons, J., Engineering outreach in middle school: The influence of a long-term school-based collaboration (2009) International Journal of Engineering Education, 25 (3), pp. 452-460; Riskowski, J.L., Todd, C.D., Wee, B., Dark, M., Harbon, J., Exploring the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary water resources engineering module in an eighth grade science course (2009) International Journal of Engineering Education, 25 (1), pp. 181-195; Sohn, S.Y., Ju, Y.H., Design and implementation of youth engineering adventure program in Korea (2011) International Journal of Engineering Education, 27 (5), pp. 1107-1116; Bullen, F., Knight, D., The broad and strategic value of the freshmen engineering experience -FEE (2006) International Journal of Engineering Education, 22 (6), pp. 1241-1251; Wendel, S., Trends in manufacturing education programs: 2011 report (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Vancouver, Canada, June 26-29; Giancoli, D.C., (2008) Physics: Principles with Applications with MasteringPhysics1, 6th Edn, , Addison Wesley, Boston, MA; Serway, R.A., Faughn, J.S., (2006) Holt Physics, , Holt McDougal, Geneva, IL; Hestenes, D., Wells, M., Swackhamer, G., Force concept inventory (1992) The Physics Teacher, 30, pp. 141-158; Tims, H., Corbett, K.S., Turner Iii, G.E., Hall, D.E., Technology enabled projects for high school physics (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Vancouver, Canada, June 26-29; Streveler, R.A., Litzinger, T.A., Miller, R.L., Steif, P.S., Learning conceptual knowledge in the engineering sciences: Overview and future research (2008) Journal of Engineering Education, 97 (3), pp. 279-294; Chang, H.P., Chen, J.Y., Guo, C.J., Chen, C.C., Chang, C.Y., Lin, S.H., Su, W.J., Tseng, W.T., Investigating primary and secondary students' learning of physics concepts in Taiwan (2007) International Journal of Science Education, 29 (4), pp. 465-482; Cowan, F.S., Usselman, M., Llewellyn, D., Gravitt, A., Utilizing constraint graphs in high school physics (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, , Nashville, TN, June 22-25; Brna, P., Confronting dynamics misconceptions (1987) Instructional Science, 16 (4), pp. 351-379; Halloun, I., Hestenes, D., Common sense concepts about motion (1985) American Journal of Physics, 53, pp. 1056-1065; Clement, J., A conceptual model discussed by Balileo and used intuitively by physics students (1983) Mental Models, , D.

However, there is little agreement among academics as to both the extent of knowledge required in particular skills and what is the right mix of the technical and professional skills. These two issues are reviewed in this paper in terms of graduate attributes from the perspective of employers of mechanical engineering graduates. A survey of Chilean industry revealed a significant discrepancy between the desired and actual graduate profiles with almost all attributes rated as relevant but not used frequently or vice versa. Interestingly, the least discrepancy and the least relevance were found for technical skills with particular reference to the design and conduction of experiments. The apparent importance of professional skills over technical skills is discussed in the context of employers' expectations that are not necessarily aligned with current educational programs. It was concluded that instruction in professional skills should be embedded into the technical courses to promote active, reflective and student-centered learning. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","ABET outcomes; Accreditation; Case study; Engineering education; Graduate attributes","ABET outcomes; Chilean industry; Educational program; Engineering program; Graduate attributes; Graduate profiles; Non-technical skills; Professional skills; Student-centered learning; Technical course; Technical skills; Accreditation; Engineering education; Mechanical engineering; Professional aspects; Technical presentations; Students","Fink, L.D., Ambrose, S., Wheeler, D., Becoming a professional engineering educator.

How can institutions meet increasing demands to produce graduates with sound scientific fundamentals and essential non-technical skills, while ensuring they are knowledgeable of state of the art advances in technology? To better frame the discussion, I present an analysis of historical technical innovation and engineering knowledge trends, and provide a perspective on the practice of parsing technological knowledge to define new engineering disciplines. Evidence suggests that the emergence of new engineering disciplines has historically matched the pace of increases in technological innovations, with both the number of disciplines and technological innovation doubling at a rate of between 31 and 35 years. Continued success of the parsing strategy requires increased emphasis on certain engineering education trends such as instilling communication and teaming skills, an emphasis on life-long learning skills, and mechanisms for interdisciplinary integration. Lastly, I recommend that a proactive and thoughtful mapping of future disciplinary demarcations could prove more beneficial than the current ad hoc process. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Communication; Curriculum; Engineering education; Innovation","Ad hoc process; Engineer of 2020; Engineering disciplines; Engineering knowledge; Life long learning; Non-technical skills; State of the art; Teaming skills; Technical innovation; Technological innovation; Technological knowledge; Communication; Curricula; Engineering education; Innovation","Astin, A.W., Astin, H.S., (1992) Final Report: Undergraduate Science Education: The Impact of Different College Environments on the Educational Pipeline in the Sciences, , Higher Education Research Institute, Graduate School of Education, UCLA; Shuman, L.J., Delaney, C., Wolfe, H., Scalise, A., Besterfield-Sacre, M., Engineering attrition: Student characteristics and educational initiatives (1999) American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Conference, , Charlotte, North Carolina, June 20-23; (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering The National Academies Press, Washington DC; (2012) An Agency of the Department of Commerce, , http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html, The United States Patent and Trademark Office June 26; (2012) An Agency of the Department of Commerce, , http://www.uspto.gov/go/taf/h_counts.htm, The United States Patent and Trademark Office June 26; Seely, B., Patterns in the History of engineering education reform: A brief history (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , The National Academies Press, Washington DC; (2006) Science and Engineering Indicators 2006, , National Science Board National Science Foundation, Arlington VA; (2007), http://main.abet.org/aps/Accreditedprogramsearch.aspx, ABET Website, March 19; Lawrence, P., Lorsch, J., (1967) Organization and Environment, , Irwin, Homewood, IL; Nicholl, C., (2004) Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind, , Penguin New York; Capra, F., (2007) The Science of Leonardo: Inside the Mind of the Great Genius of the Renaissance, , Doubleday New York; Lester, T., (2012) Da Vinci's Ghost: Genius, Obsession, and How Leonardo Created the World in His Own Image, , Simon & Schuster, New York","Bowen, D.M.; California State University, 25800 Carlos Bee Blvd, Hayward, CA 94542, United States; email: david.bowen@csueastbay.edu",0949149X,,,"English","Int.

This paper investigates how an engineering service learning module with a focus on leadership can affect engineering students' confidence level for technical and professional traits. This leadership module was offered as part of our first-year course that aims to expose freshmen to general engineering principles. The research question in this paper addresses what is the effect, if any, of an engineering service learning module on (1) the confidence levels of women and men as it relates to eleven National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and ABET engineering traits and (2) their confidence in and perceptions of leadership. Data were collected via two surveys administered at the beginning and end of the module. One hundred and thirteen students returned both NAE-ABET surveys and fifty-two returned both leadership surveys. A two tailed Student's t-test with equal variance was utilized with a confidence level of both 95% and 90% to test for statistical significance. The results showed leadership module students increased in confidence in all NAE-ABET and leadership skills, while students not in the module increased less or decreased in confidence in most NAE-ABET skills. Women in our leadership module increased their confidence on all NAE-ABET skills, while other women experienced no significant increase in confidence level. Within the leadership module, women's confidence increased more than men's confidence in all but four NAE-ABET traits. The statistical trends of students' survey responses and qualitative analysis of the comments show no negative impact on their confidence in technical and professional skills when compared with students in the more technical modules. Moreover, qualitative responses from women indicate overwhelming appreciation for the experience and skills gained from the leadership module, as well as increased confidence for women as engineers. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Design; First-year; Leadership; Outreach; Professional skills; Service learning; Teamwork","First-year; Leadership; Outreach; Professional skills; Service learning; Teamwork; Design; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Statistical tests; Surveys; Technical presentations; Students","Kumar, S., Hsiao, J.K., Engineers learn ''soft skills the hard way'': Planting a seed of leadership in engineering classes (2007) Leadership and Management in Engineering, 7 (1), pp. 18-23; (2005) Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, , National Academy of Engineering Publication of the National Academy of Engineering, Washington, D.C; (1995) Engineering Education: Designing An Adaptive System, , National Research Council National Academies Press, Washington, D.C; Shuman, L., Besterfield-Sacre, M., McGourty, J., The ABET ''professional skills'' -can they be taught?

Given the advances in communication media, such as the Internet2 network, which is designed for education purposes, it is easier for universities that have such manufacturing cells to share their resources. Under this premise, this paper presents the development and results of a case study involving a didactic teleoperated cell and the interaction between the ITESM in Mexico and the ESPE (Escuela Politécnica del Ejercito) in Ecuador, through the Internet2 network. The universities have similar graduate programs for automated systems but only the ITESM (Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey) has a full didactic manufacturing cell: a CNC, a transportation band and an automated storage system. For the aforementioned cell, the software that integrates all the control systems was developed by students of both universities and operated as a server for client software given to the students of the ESPE. Practices and surveys for the students were developed and applied in order to compare the knowledge acquired between the students using the cell directly and the students using the cell via the teleoperated cell. This kind of system helps universities to provide more advanced courses and the subject treated in this paper seeks to support the feasibility of telepresence systems as a mean of education. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Education; Internet2; Labview; Manufacturing cell; Teleoperation","Automated storage; Automated systems; Client software; Communication media; Ecuador; Graduate program; Internet2; LabViEW; Me-xico; Project development; Tele-presence systems; Teleoperated; Automation; Cells; Cellular manufacturing; Cytology; Education; Engineering education; Flexible manufacturing systems; Remote control; Societies and institutions; Visual communication; Students","Tsang, F., The quality of telepresence teaching and learning (2007) C RoC, pp. 1-6. , April; Yeung, F., Internet 2: Scaling up the backbone for R&D (1997) IEEE Internet Computing, pp. 36-37. , March-April; Goertz, R., (1953) Remote-control Manipulator, , United State Patent Office Atomic Energy. 2632574 March 24; Hannaford, B., Anderson, R., Experimental and simulation studies of hard contact in force reflecting teleoperation (2002) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 584-589. , Philadelphia, PA, April 1988, 06 August; Miyazaki, F., Matsubayashi, S., Yoshimi, T., Arimoto, S., A new control methodology toward advanced teleoperation of master-slave robot systems (2003) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 997-1002. , San Francisco, CA, April 1986, 06 January; Clement, G., Fournier, R., Gravez, P., Morillon, J., Computer aided teleoperation: From arm to vehicle control (2002) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 590-592. , Philadelphia, PA, April 1988, 06 August; Fong, C., Dotson, R., Bejczy, A., Distributed microcomputer control system for advanced teleoperation (2003) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 987-995. , San Francisco, CA, April 1986, 06 January; Golberg, K., Mascha, M., Gentner, S., Rothenberg, N., Sutter, C., Wiegley, J., Desktop teleoperation via the world wide web (2002) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 654-659. , May 1995, 6 August; Paulos, E., Canny, J., Delivering real reality to the World WideWebvia telerobotics (2002) IEEEInternational Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1694-1699. , April 1996, 6 August; http://telerobot.mech.uwa.edu.au/, The Telelabs Project accessed 27 March 2011; Enloe, C.L., Pakula, W.A., Finney, G.A., Haaland, R.K., Teleoperation in the undergraduate physics laboratory (1999) IEEE Transactions on Education, 42 (3), pp. 174-179; Abdessemed, F., (2009) Web Based Learning for Engineering Education, , Al Jouf University.

Technology Education has been proactive in this arena as it has transformed over the decades to meet ever-changing societal needs. The most recent change to the discipline has been to add engineering and, as a result, adopting a new name and curriculum-Engineering and Technology Education. The added component and name change in Technology Education is causing discussions about what the new direction means, what professional preparation changes will be incurred, and what work graduating students will be prepared to do. In light of these changes, this study investigated perceptions of high school students in the United States of America about engineering and technology courses they take. To investigate whether students' perceptions are in accord with current changes in Engineering and Technology Education, 316 students enrolled in engineering and technology courses in Georgia schools that have an affiliation with the Georgia Engineering and Technology Education Association (GETEA) were surveyed. According to data analyses, students' perceptions can be divided into two factors. Educational Value of Course (factor 1) was extracted from statements measuring the degree to which the courses prepare students for employment and provide them with information regarding future employment. Personal Relevance of Course (factor 2) was derived from statements measuring students' perceptions about links between engineering and technology education and their personal lives. Such findings suggest these students valued their engineering and technology courses, planned to continue their education, made good grades, and had varied types of career expectations for jobs such as design engineers and architects. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Curriculum; Educational value of course; Engineering and technology education; Personal relevance of course; Professional development; Students' perception","Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects; Educational value of course; Engineering and technology; High school curriculum; High school students; Personal relevance of course; Professional development; Technology education; United States of America; Students","(2011) UK Education Systems, , http://www.britishcouncil.org/usa-education-uk-system-k-12-education.htm, British Council; Benjamin, L.A., (1993) Parents' Literacy and Their Children's Success in School: Recent Research, Promising Practices, and Research Implications, , Office of Educational Research and Improvement Washington, DC; Burlin, F.D., The relationship of parental education and maternal work and occupational status to occupational aspiration in adolescent females (1976) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 9, pp. 99-104. , 10.1016/0001-8791(76)90011-7; (2011) The Prime Ministers's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, , http://www.innovation.gov.au/Science/PMSEIC/Pages/default.aspx, Chief Scientist office, Australian Government, Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research; Clarke, V.A., Teague, G.J., Characterizations of computing careers: Students and professionals disagree (1996) Computers Education, 26 (4), pp. 241-246. , 10.1016/0360-1315(96)00004-8; Domenico, D.M., Jones, K.H., Career aspirations of women in the 20th century (2006) Journal of Career and Technical Education, 22 (2), pp. 1-4; (2011) Education in the Netherlands, , http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Education_in_the_Netherlands#Elementary_School, Accessed January 2011; Fralick, B., Kearn, J., Thompson, S., Lyons, J., How middle schoolers draw engineers and scientists (2009) Journal of Science Education Technology, 18, pp. 60-73. , 10.1007/s10956-008-9133-3; (2010), http://www.gadoe.org/ci_cta.aspx?PageReq=CICTATechnology, Georgia Department of Education (GADOE) Downloaded 3 Sep 2010; (2009) Georgia Department of Education Georgia Performance Standards, , https://www.georgiastandards.org/Pages/Default.aspx, GeorgiaStandards.org Extracted June 1, 2009; Gupta, U.G., Houtz, L.E., High school students' perceptions of information technology skills and careers (2000) Journal of Industrial Technology, 16 (4), pp. 1-8; Hacker, M., Burghardt, D., Addressing issues related to technology and engineering: An interview (2008) The Technology Teacher, 68 (2), pp. 25-29; Haynie Iii., W.J., Cross-gender interaction in technology education: A survey (1999) Journal of Technology Education, 10 (2), pp. 36-42; Hill, R.B., New perspectives: Technology teacher education and engineering design (2006) Journal of Industrial Teacher Education, 43 (3), pp. 45-63; (2010), International Technology and Engineering Education Association (ITEEA) Accessed 14 Sep 2010; Jepson, A., Perl, T., Priming the pipeline (2002) SIGCSE Bulletin, 34 (2), pp. 36-39. , 10.1145/543812.543826; Jones, K.H., Womble, M.N., At-risk students' perceptions of work and career-related issues (1998) Journal for Vocational Special Needs Education, 20, pp. 12-25; Jones, K.H., Womble, M., Searcy, C.A., T & i education students' perceptions of courses (1997) Journal of Industrial Teacher Education, 34 (2), pp. 82-101; Kingery D., .W., Bryant L., .D., Palmer L., .K., Araghi F., .A., (1989) A Handbook of Survey Research.

Their emerging understandings of the steps required to develop a new product were investigated through a series of interviews. A theoretical framework linking technological knowledge to 'funds of knowledge' from experiences outside the classroom supported the analysis. The data suggest that young children draw on a broad range of experiences and knowledge, often uncritically, in order to explain how things are made. They are able to transfer their understandings of the technological process from one experience to another particularly when they have the language and background experiences to support them. Of particular note however, is that they were often unfamiliar with the properties of materials and therefore unable to anticipate the processes necessary to convert raw materials into a final product.

The teacher's role has changed considerably over time. There is now, more than ever, a need for much greater transparency, accountability and collaborative practice within education. Famous philosophers and theorists including Plato, Rousseau and Dewey have expounded ideals of authenticity and authentic engagement, but it is only with the spread of constructivism that authenticity has gained more favour. The authors will investigate perspectives of authenticity, authentic learning, and authentic activities (Kreber et al. in Adult Educ Q Am Assoc Adult Contin Educ 58(1):22-43, 2007; Newmann in Authentic achievement: restructuring schools for intellectual quality, Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Fransisco, 1996; Newmann and Wehlage in Educ Leadersh 50(7):8-12, 1993; Reeves et al. in Quality conversations. Paper presented at the 25th HERDSA annual conference, 2002; Splitter in Stud Philos Educ 28(2):135-151, 2008). Through qualitative investigation they identify and summarise key viewpoints and demonstrate how these can be successfully implemented through programmes of technology education. A model of authentic technology for producing quality technological outcomes is presented. The authors show how an activity from an initial teacher education course in technology education uses identified aspects of authentic technological practice through the various dimensions of authenticity to develop enduring learning for students. They consider the role of context in developing learning and introduce some new ideas on successful student engagement in the field of conation (Riggs and Gholar in Strategies that promote student engagement, Corwin Press, California, 2009). Conation is defined as the will, drive and effort behind students' engagement in learning and is increasingly seen as an integral part of authentic education. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Authentic achievement; Authentic learning; Authenticity; Meaningful contexts; Real-world'; Student engagement","Authentication; Curricula; Education computing; Philosophical aspects; Students; Teaching; Authentic achievement; Authentic learning; Authenticity; Meaningful contexts; Real-world; Student engagement; Engineering education","(1995) Concise Dictionary & Thesaurus, , Authenticity (2nd ed).

This study examined a project-based learning (PjBL) activity that integrated STEM using survey and interview methods. The participants were 30 freshmen with engineering related backgrounds from five institutes of technology in Taiwan. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to examine student attitudes towards STEM before and after the PjBL activity. The results of the survey showed that students' attitudes to the subject of engineering changed significantly. Most of the students recognized the importance of STEM in the science and engineering disciplines; they mentioned in interview that the possession of professional science knowledge is useful to their future career and that technology may improve our lives and society, making the world a more convenient and efficient place. In conclusion, combining PjBL with STEM can increase effectiveness, generate meaningful learning and influence student attitudes in future career pursuit.

The principal purpose of the paper is to indicate that the process re-engineering model commonly employed in business environments can also be used in an educational system. In particular, the paper describes the process of re-engineering used for the transformation of the BEng (Mech) program in order to align it with the accreditation requirements. The study adopts a Business Re-engineering Process (BRP) in which engineering education is considered as a process. A modified McKinsey's re-engineering model was chosen as a tool to re-engineer the educational system. The model involves five broad phases, namely, identification, review&analysis, re-design, test & implementation and continuous improvement. The paper concentrates on the first two phases. The existing curriculum is mapped according to the graduate attributes, competency profiles and the Exit Level Outcomes of the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA). From the list of identified deficiencies it can be concluded that the major shortcoming of the program is not its content but its delivery. It is recommended that innovative flexible delivery methods should be used as teaching styles. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Accreditation; Mechanical engineering program; Re-engineering","Accreditation; Curricula; Engineering education; Business environments; Continuous improvements; Educational systems; Engineering council of south africa; Mechanical engineering program; Process reengineering; Scientific development; University of Botswana; Reengineering","Lang, J.D., Cruse, S., McVey, F.D., McMasters, J., Industry expectations of new engineers: A survey to assist curriculum designers (1999) Journal of Engineering Education, 88, pp. 43-51; Nguyen, D.Q., The essential skills and attributes of an engineer: A comparative study of academics, industry personnel and engineering students (1998) Global Journal of Engineering Education, 2, pp. 65-75; Rugarcia, A., Felder, R.M., Woods, D.R., Stice, J.E., The future of engineering education: A vision for a new century (2000) Chemical Engineering Education, 34, pp. 16-25; Amadei, B., Engineering for the developing world (2004) The Bridge, 34, pp. 24-31; Mardam-Bey, O., Engineering education quality beyond program accreditation certification vs. Accreditation (2008) ARISER, 4, pp. 47-52; Oberst, B.S., Jones, R.C., International trends in engineering accreditation and quality assurance (2000) The Many Facets of International Education of Engineers, pp. 1-7. , J.

Candidates must give one or more hour long seminars on their past and future research, which many have never done before. Additional challenges come in the form of a rigorous 1-2 day interview, making small talk and meeting with potential colleagues in both social and professional contexts. In 2011, the graduate students in the University of Washington (UW) Chemical Engineering department designed a seminar to help bridge the gap between graduate school or postdoctoral research and applying as a candidate for first permanent positions. The seminar series takes place each summer and is comprised of 7-8 students and postdoctoral researchers from around the country. In an effort to maximally impact the graduate students at UW ChE, all facets of organization, selection and execution of the seminar are executed by the students themselves. Applications to the seminar are comprised of an abstract, C.V., and a letter of recommendation. A team of four ""lead"" students are selected each Spring to handle receipt and organization of applications. Thereafter a panel of ∼15 current grad students is selected to complete a daylong meeting in the style of an NSF review panel. An explicit goal of this step in the process is to exposure our grads to some of the most accomplished young scholars in the field who are actively seeking permanent positions. Our hope was to help the graduate students self-calibrate and provide a wide basis for comparison in terms of things like publication and presentation records. During the first year of the panel students were faced with the difficult task of balancing strictly quantitative scoring metrics with other valuable factors such as contributions to diversity or qualitative ""intangibles"". To facilitate a professional and fair process, the UW ADVANCE program was asked to provide workshop to our students during the 2nd and 3rdyears. The workshop helped the students address the issues in a constructive way and more fairly make panel selections of people who excel in a broad range of metrics. This poster reviews quantitative analysis of surveys given to three populations: 1) the graduate students who attended the seminar, 2) graduate students who served on the panel and 3) the selected speakers who visited UW to give the seminar. All groups gave enormously positive feedback, stating that the seminar helped them prepare for interviews and their future careers. All the students involved wanted to continue the seminar in future years. We also use the poster to review the structure and organization of the new seminar and provide perspective on how the concept could be translated to other departments or institutions.",,"Education; Engineering education; Feedback; Chemical engineering department; Graduate levels; Graduate schools; Graduate students; Post-doctoral research; Postdoctoral researchers; Quantitative scoring; University of Washington; Students",,,,9781634390378,,"English","Educ.

We have recently revised and expanded this part of our curriculum in a move to a faculty-wide sequence of courses that will present design, communications and professional practice aspects in a consistent framework across all of our programs (CDIO Standard 5). The new, four-year Engineering Design and Practice Sequence (EDPS) at Queen's is core for all engineering students. It focuses on developing competence in design process methods and tools, problem analysis, creativity, economics and entrepreneurship, engineering communications, professionalism and ethics. It was designed as project based, meeting the requirements of the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board, thus addressing Washington Accord based requirements, and targeting relevant CDIO Syllabus elements. EDPS is following a staged roll-out, with the revised introductory course given to first year students starting in 2010/2011 and the second year design and communications course being delivered for the first time in 2011/2012. This paper reviews the EDPS course design process, year by year objectives and outcomes, and evaluation methods in comparison with previously published EDPSs (Frank et al, 2011). Experience and results from the first two years of offering the sequence are presented. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Communications; Curriculum; Design; Integration; Project; Spine","Communication; Design; Engineering education; Integration; Professional aspects; Teaching; Engineering accreditation; Engineering communications; First year students; Introduction to engineering course; Introductory course; Professional practices; Project; Spine; Curricula","Clapham, L., Topper, A., (2001) From Experiments to Experimentation: A New Philosophy for First Year Laboratories, , Twelfth Canadian Conference on Engineering Education, University of Victoria; Collins, A., Brown, J., Newman, S., Cognitive Apprenticeship: Teaching the Craft of Reading, Writing, and Mathematics (1989) Knowing, Learning, and Instruction.

As a result, many universities in Australia and worldwide, are investing heavily in modern teaching tools, often equipping lecture theatres with the latest multimedia facilities. However, at the same time, there are growing pressures on academic staff regarding the competing needs for their time spent on research and other commitments. Questions therefore arise as to whether these new education technologies are in fact welcomed and used by some academics, despite the reported advantages to the student learning experience when used effectively. To investigate this, several surveys of engineering staff and students regarding education technology were conducted to establish the perceptions of their impacts on student learning and scope of their use. Based on these results and a review of the literature, recommendations are proposed for effective strategies for academic staff who wish to adopt education technologies. The objective is to decrease the resistance of those academics that may not yet have embraced some of the more modern teaching technologies. This is done by demonstrating that if integrated into existing teaching practices in a systematic manner, any short-term increase in workload can be offset by longer term efficiencies, along with potential improvements to student understanding and satisfaction. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","E-learning;

The program has an aim and structure that emphasises employability, integration of general engineering skills, authentic engineering experiences with a focus on holistic view of the complete lifecycle of products and systems. The realisation of these aims stress the need of an integrated and adaptable sustainable development education for mechanical engineering. To reach this goal, we applied a combined top-down and bottom-up education development process that started with the formulation of program vision and program level learning outcomes. Faculty meetings and workshop were used to formulate the course learning outcomes and to map the program level outcomes to courses in which the outcomes are satisfied followed this. The strategy integrated specific sustainability topics in courses where it is appropriate and to have a separate course in sustainable development to ensure that general aspects of sustainable development are included and that a team of faculty takes full responsibility for this. Design-build-test project courses are shown to be suitable arenas for integrating teaching and learning of sustainable development. Results from a student survey on perceptions of the relevance and quality of sustainability education are discussed. Finally, continuing challenges in the area are identified. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Curriculum development; Education for sustainable development; Integrated curriculum; Mechanical engineering; Program development","Education; Engineering education; Integration; Life cycle; Mechanical engineering; Planning; Sustainable development; Teaching; Chalmers University of Technology; Curriculum development; Development process; Education for sustainable development; Mechanical engineering curriculum; Program development; Sustainability education; Teaching and learning; Curricula","Crawley, E., Malmqvist, J., Lucas, W.A., Brodeur, D., The CDIO Syllabus v2.0-An Updated Statement of Goals for Engineering Education (2011) Proceedings of the 7th International CDIO Conference, , Copenhagen, Denmark; Edvardsson Stiwne, E., Roxå, T., Programethos och dess betydelse för studenters lärande och personliga utveckling inom tekniska utbildningar (Programme Ethos and its Significance for Engineering Students' Learning and Personal Development) (2009) Proceedings 2nd Utvecklingskonferensen för Sveriges ingenjörsutbildningar, , Lund, Sweden; Enelund, M., (2011) Programme Description for M.

It is argued that transformational change is required which (i) alters the culture of the institution by changing select underlying assumptions and institutional behaviours, processes, and products; (ii) is deep and pervasive, affecting the whole institution; (iii) is intentional; and (iv) occurs over time (Kezar & Eckel, 2002). It is also argued that change leadership of this nature must be distributed, not solely laid at the feet of Deans and Vice Chancellors. A strategy for change is presented based on observations and evidence from the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) project ""Design based curriculum reform within engineering education"" and the recently completed ALTC Discipline Scholars' Survey of Engineering Academics grounded in the research for transformational change within businesses, universities and teaching and learning. This model for change proposes the development of a network of change agents built on a brokerage model to improve best practice and leadership capacity through systematically and directly engaging with the strategic/tactical and operational levels of engineering faculties. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Change strategies; Engineering education transformation; National consortium","Curricula; Education; Change strategies; Curriculum reform; Engineering curriculum; Engineering faculty; Learning and teachings; National consortium; Operational level; Teaching and learning; Engineering education","Boshier, R., Why is the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning such a hard sell?

The successful results of the project demonstrated the effectiveness of the systems thinking and CDIO approach, and endorsed this as the basis for a major change strategy. Not only did it demonstrate the quality of all the students on the course, their potential and commitment to engineering, but it also demonstrated willingness of the faculty to take a risk and to embrace change. The project scenario opened up an otherwise overlooked teaching resource: that of practitioner lecturers with many years of experience of implementation and operation of major projects. These skills were essential to the scoping, design, planning and implementation of the project as well as giving the backdrop of best practice from industry. Auckland's experience of introducing a major step change may be used as a template for other universities who may wish to follow Auckland's example.

This work corresponds to the implementation stage of the curriculum reform using a CDIO-based approach currently underway at the School of Engineering. Before this reform, students had only one introductory course to their field of study, meeting one hour a week. After the reform, computer science students take an Introduction to Computer Science course and a Programming Laboratory. Similarly, the industrial engineering program now includes an Introduction to Industrial Engineering and an Engineering Communication course. These courses have been designed using CDIO standards 1, 4 and 8 as guidelines and have been formulated to include active learning in its many forms such as project-based learning, problem-based learning, case studies, small group discussions, oral presentations and reflective memos. The redesign impact was assessed via anonymous student surveys and reflective memos. Our results show improved student understanding of their professional endeavour and increased student motivation for their engineering programs. Student surveys registered high degrees of satisfaction with active learning techniques, working in teams, and receiving immediate feedback from instructors and peers. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Active learning; CDIO-based curriculum reform; Engineering education","Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Curricula; Education; Students; Surveys; Technical presentations; Active Learning; Computer Science course; Computer science students; Curriculum reform; Engineering communications; First year engineering course; Industrial engineering course; Small group discussions; Engineering education","Brodeur, D., Crawley, E., Program Evaluation Aligned with the CDIO Standards (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, , Portland, Oregon, 12-15 June; Brookfield, S., Preskill, S., (1999) Discussion as a Way of Teaching: Tools and Techniques for Democratic Classrooms, , Jossey-Bass Inc., San Francisco, CA; Problem-Based Learning (2001) Speaking of Teaching, 11 (1). , Center for Teaching and Learning, Winter; Crawley, E., Malmqvist, J., Ostlund, S., Brodeur, D., (2007) Rethinking Engineering Education: The CDIO Approach, , Springer Sciences + Business Media LLC, New York; Crawley, E.F., Jianzhong, C., Malmqvist, J., Brodeur, D.R., The Context in Engineering Education (2008) Proceedings of the 4th International CDIO Conference, , Hogeschool Gent, Gent, Belgium; Dann, W., Cooper, S., Pausch, R., (2011) Learning to Program with Alice, , 3rd edition, Prentice Hall, New York; De Miguel, M., (2006) Metodologías de Enseñanza y Aprendizaje para Desarrollo de Competencias, , Alianza Editorial, Madrid; Ellis, A., Carswell, L., Bernat, A., Deveaux, D., Frison, P., Meisalo, V., Meyer, J., Tarhio, J., Resources, tools, and techniques for problem based learning in computing (1998) ACM SIGCUE Outlook, 26 (4). , October; Evensen, D., Hmelo, C., (2000) Problem-Based Learning: A Research Perspective on Learning Interactions, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ; Frías, M., (1998) Procesos creativos para la construcción de textos.

The industrial and social needs of improving the ceramic production process and of developing novel advanced ceramic multifunctional materials and structures were essential for the creation of a synergetic cooperation between a world leader industry for Ceramics (SACMI), a medium enterprise specialized in Virtual Prototyping (ENGINSOFT) and an academic research group in Solids and Structural Mechanics of the University of Trento. The research collaboration has lasted several years producing a continuous inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary transfer of knowledge among the partners and maximising in this way their performance, in particular in terms of added value generated through human capital improvements. An additional impact of the above mentioned cooperation has been the award of a Marie Curie - Industry Academia-Partnership & Pathway four years grant focused on boosting skills exchange between the commercial and non-commercial sectors through secondments of academic staff and PhD students to industry and vice-versa. Moreover, the partnership has led to a significant enhancement in the teaching results, together with an increasing motivation of the students, crucial in the Engineering Education. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.","Ceramic industry; FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IAPP Marie Curie Action; Transfer of knowledge","Ceramic materials; Education; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Mergers and acquisitions; Structural ceramics; Students; Ceramic industries; Ceramic production process; Collaborative projects; FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IAPP Marie Curie Action; Multi-functional materials; Research collaborations; Synergetic cooperation; Transfer of knowledge; Engineering education","Education at a Glance 2012: OECD Indicators Country Note: Italy, , http://www.oecd.org/edu/EAG2012%20-%20Country%20note%20-%20Italy.pdf, Accessed 12 October 2012; La Domanda e l'Offerta di Laureati e Diplomati Nel 2011, , http://excelsior.unioncamere.net/images/pubblicazioni/ Il%20Lavoro%20dopo%20gli%20studi%20web%202011.pdf, Union Camere-Ministero del Lavoro, Accessed 15 October 2012; I Fabbisogni Occupazionali e Formative Delle Imprese Italiane nell'Industria e Nei Servizi per Il 2011, , http://excelsior.unioncamere.net/documenti/previsioniarp/doc.php?id=5, Union Camere-Ministero del Lavoro, Accessed 15 October 2012; Ewsuk, K.G., Compaction science and technology (1997) MRS Bull, 22, pp. 14-16; Piccolroaz, A., Bigoni, D., Gajo, A., An elastoplastic framework for granular materials becoming cohesive through mechanical densification.

We regard using Problem-Based Learning (PBL) as a strategy of the pedagogical approach and application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a strategy of the technological approach. The two approaches are possibility combined in one educational context. From this sense, a case on Web 2.0 employed at Aalborg University, Denmark where has a long history of PBL model is discussed in this paper. This case indicates that ICT may offer students in PBL personal tools for knowledge construction, reflecting, sharing and collaboration in project work, while also connecting to communities, network and resources of their own interest. Relating this case to the challenges of sustainability of education development in developing countries, some practical issues will be discussed in the countries such as India, Thailand and China.","Education; ICT; PBL; Sustainability","Developing countries; Education; Education computing; Sustainable development; Aalborg University; Educational context; Information and Communication Technologies; Knowledge construction; Pedagogical approach; Practical issues; Problem based learning; Project work; Engineering education","Future work-trends and challenges for work in the 21st century http://www.ncrel.org/engauge/skills/21skills.htm, US Department of Labor, available from accessed 31, May 2012; Tinio, V.L., ICT in education http://139.179.20.111/egitim/eprimer-edu.pdf, available from accessed 30 May, 2012; Sterling, S., (2004) Sustainable Education, Re-visioning Learning and Change, , UK: J.

The authors having been personally inspired by the Bronze exhibition at the Royal Academy initiated discussion around several aspects of design education contemporary within higher education. After analysis of Masters' students output from current curriculum delivery relative to drawing standards, manufacturing knowledge and ideas generation it was decided to revisit and redesign the curriculum; attempting to 'bring to the table' the quality of renaissance design and build integrated with new technology and facets of multi-disciplinarity. This paper describes that on-going process of educating students to produce artefacts generated through the renaissance process, of developing drawing techniques which enhance 3 dimensional realisation of form and enabling students to share that newly acquired knowledge with their peers. It was envisaged that they in turn would deliver and mentor a similar new content to the under-graduate students. It was also decided to initialise this approach by as usual teach perspective and orthographic projection but rather than use engineering or product artefacts to use organic models e.g., fruit, bringing an atmosphere of the art studio and 'still life' to the studio sessions.","Craft; Mentoring; Practise; Proctoring; Time","Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Product design; Studios; Teaching; Craft; Mentoring; Practise; Proctoring; Time; Students","(2012) RA Gallery Guide, p. 1. , Royal Academy.

This kind of ongoing need for training is slowing innovation. This problem is related to the difficulty in obtaining consistent training resources and services especially with lack of training for advanced manufacturing practices for specialised industry sectors. More and more occupations require degrees higher than secondary education because of the global need for so called 'knowledge workers'. An example of an interactive learning programme, developed with the support of narrated presentation technology, podcasts and online access has been shown in this paper. Sixty nine online modules have been developed during the course of a project funded by Department of Labor for automotive sector. These online modules have been developed for lifelong learners to be used and accessed at any time (asynchronously from a website). Curriculum modules, developed for the Introduction to Digital Manufacturing are a part of a certificate programme which expands the pool of skilled workers, enhance the abilities of incumbent workers, and strengthen the entire advanced manufacturing sector. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Automotive industry;

One of the most significant factors contributing to education on the Internet has been the development of Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies, socially interactive in nature, have much to contribute to the area of Computer Assisted Language Leaning. Unfortunately, Web 2.0 technologies for the most part have been used in an ad hoc manner, permitting language learners acquire knowledge through interaction, but not through a more structured manner as these technologies were not developed to help lean languages as such. The goal of our work is to research and develop an environment, which employs Web 2.0 technology plus online language learning tools to provide a more integrated language learning environment. This paper will explore the technologies and provide information about how tools can be better integrated to provide a more productive working environment for language learners. A first working proof of concept based on our approach introduced is promising supporting modern language requirements and first findings and space for improvements are discussed.","Computer assisted language learning; E-education; Flexible learning environment; Guided and unguided learning; Second language learning","E-learning; Engineering education; Computer assisted language learning; E-education; Flexible Learning; Guided and unguided learning; Second language; Computer aided instruction","Amaral, L., Meurers, D., On using intelligent computerassisted language learning in real-life foreign language teaching and learning (2011) ReCALL, 23 (1), pp. 4-24. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0958344010000261; (2012) Amazon Web Service, , http://aws.amazon.com/de/, Amazon Web Service, Last retrieved Feb. 9th, 2012 from; (2012) Apache HTTP Server, , http://projects.apache.org/projects/http_server.html, Apache Software Foundation, last retrieved Feb. 11th, 2012 from , APACHE; Asher, J., (1977) Learning Another Language Through Actions: The CompleteTeacheŕs Guidebook, , Los Gatos, Calif.: Sky Oaks Productions; Beatty, K., (2003) Teaching and Researching Computer Assisted Language Learning, , New York: Longman; Boruta, S., Gütl, C., Chang, V., Edwards, A., Foreign Language Learning Environment built on Web 2.0 Technologies (2011) International Conference on Interactive Computer-Aided Learning, pp. 82-88. , ICL2011, Sept. 2011, Piestany, Slovakia; Carlsson, C., Hagsand, D., DIVE-Multi-User Virtual Reality System (1993) VRAIS '93, IEEE Virtual Reality Annual international Symposium, pp. 394-400. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VRAIS.1993.380753; (2011) Vocabulary trainer, , http://www.lingoclub.com/html2/index.php?option=com, Cambridge, Last retrieved July 28th, 2011 from; Chapelle, C., (2003) English Language Learning and Technology, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Chang, V., Gütl, C., Generation Y Learning in the 21st Century: Integration of Virtual Worlds and Cloud Computing Services (2010) Proceedings of Global Learn Asia Pacific 2010, pp. 1888-1897. , Z.

One of the major challenges for knowledge management is to select the right knowledge from numerous sources, including know - how of individuals, and to transform it into useful, practicable knowledge. The focus should always be on supporting strategic organisational goals. In this context, from the organisation's strategic point of view, it is very important to link an institutional knowledge management system with the knowledge management systems of individuals. This paper presents personalised IT - support for knowledge management within industrial R&D and especially for teaching and learning. The support is based on the use of a long term developed in - house software that enables individuals (managers and teachers) to process and manage knowledge on their desktop computers in a user friendly way. Within the implementation of ""Technology - enhanced learning"" at the Faculty of Materials Science and Technology, a pre - programmed work environment called BIKE (Batch Information and Knowledge Editor) was developed. However, this desktop environment works also as a teacher's personalized knowledge management system. It is programmed by the lead author of this paper who is a teacher; therefore the outcomes into teaching bachelor students are implemented directly into the classroom. The paper also presents how such IT - support complements, at a personalized level, the existing organizational knowledge management tool known as the university's Academic Information System. Some examples from teaching are presented, communication channels (teacher - student forums) were also mentioned as a part of the teacher's knowledge management personalised system. In this case, the BIKE environment is demonstrated as an alternative to learning management systems based on the so called WEB 2.0 technologies.","Component; Computer assisted learning; Educational technology; Knowledge management; Knowledge management system; Technology-enhanced learning","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Educational technology; Engineering education; Environmental management; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Personal computers; Students; Technology transfer; Component; Computer assisted learning; Institutional knowledge; Knowledge management system; Learning management system; Materials science and technology; Organizational knowledge management; Technology enhanced learning; Knowledge management","Smith, E.A., The role of tacit and explicit knowledge in the workplace (2001) Journal of Knowledge Management, 5 (4), pp. 311-321. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13673270110411733; Reilly, C., The Concept of Knowledge in KM: a Relational Model (2009) The Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, 7 (1), pp. 145-154. , www.ejkm.com, available online at; Herschel, R.T., Nemati, H., Steiger, D., Tacit to explicit knowledge conversion: knowledge exchange protocols (2001) Journal of Knowledge Management, 5 (1), pp. 07-116. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13673270110384455; Tsoukas, H., Do we really understand tacit knowledge?

So, the integration of ICT in the teaching and learning of mathematics, as a result of ICT educational affordances, helps students have better achievement in mathematics. These potentialities of the ICT make its integration in the mathematics classroom a promising practice, but the success of this practice is dependent on various factors, among which are the following: teachers' perceptions of their ability in ICT, teachers' attitudes towards ICT contribution to the mathematics teaching, teachers' attitudes towards ICT contribution to students' mathematics learning, teachers' emotions towards the use of ICT in the mathematics classroom, teachers' feelings of self-esteem and control in the presence of ICT in the mathematics classroom, and teachers' intentions to actually integrate ICT in their teaching. The current research came to verify the readiness of Arab teachers in elementary and middle schools in Israel regarding the integration of ICT in the classroom, and hence its interest in the six above constructs. The research used a questionnaire that included statements related to each one of the above constructs. This questionnaire was administered to 475 Arab teachers in elementary and middle schools in the North, Center and Haifa regions in Israel. The research findings show that more than seventy percent of the participating teachers have positive perceptions of their competence in technology and technology integration in their teaching. Further, they have positive attitudes towards the integration of ICT in teaching and learning and of their selfesteem in the presence of technology, in addition to positive emotions towards this integration. Thus the findings indicate that the teachers are ready for the integration of technology in their teaching, and this readiness is represented not only by the participating teachers' perceptions of and attitudes towards the integration of technology in teaching and learning, but also in their intention to do so.","ICT; Teacher's ability; Teacher's intentions; Teachers' emotions; Teachers' perceptions","Behavioral research; Engineering education; Integration; Surveys; Teaching; Elementary and middle schools; Mathematics teachings; Teacher's ability; Teacher's intentions; Teachers'; Teachers' perceptions; Teaching and learning; Technology Integration; Students","Duhaney, D., Technology and the educational process: Transforming classroom activities (2000) International Journal of Instructional Media, 27 (1), pp. 67-72; Harrison, C., Cavendish, S., Comber, C., Fisher, T., Harrison, A., Haw, K., Lewin, C., Watling, R., ImpaCT2: the impact of information and communication technologies on pupil learning and attainment (2002), Coventry: Becta/London: DfES; Nakhleh, M.B., Krajcik, J.S., Influence of levels of information as presented by different technologies on students understanding of acids, base & pH concepts (1994) Journal of Research on Science Teaching., 31 (10), pp. 1077-1096. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tea.3660311004; Tüzün, H., Yilmaz-Soylu, M., Karakus, T., Inal, Y., Kizilkaya, G., The effects of computer games on primary school students' achievement and motivation in geography learning (2009) Computers and Education, 52 (1), pp. 68-77. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2008.06.008; Jimoyiannis, A., Komis, V., Computer simulations in physics teaching and learning: a case study on students' understanding of trajectory motion (2001) Computers & Education, 36, pp. 183- 204. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0360-1315(00)00059-2; Becta, What the research says about using ICT in Maths?

The basic working principle of this software package (Chaos-based Digital Communication System Simulation Package, CDCSSP) is to perform simulations of chaos-based digital modulation types under different conditions such as distinct chaotic oscillators and channel noise effects. Power spectra of the signals, some important time domain signals and Bit Error Rate (BER) curves for all the modulation types can be observed graphically by using CDCSSP. The main purpose of CDCSSP is to give preliminary information about chaos-based digital modulation schemes by using a visual interface with the graphical and numerical results of the simulations. T-test statistical analysis demonstrates how successful CDCSSP is in terms of enhancing student learning for educational purposes. CDCSSP can be used for educational purposes as an easy-to-use and user-friendly visual instruction tool. © Manchester University Press.","Chaos; digital modulation; engineering education; MATLAB-GUI; modelling; Simulink","Bit error rate; Chaos theory; Circuit oscillations; Engineering education; Graphical user interfaces; MATLAB; Models; Time domain analysis; Digital modulation techniques; Digital modulations; Enhancing student learning; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); MATLAB GUI; Modelling and simulations; Preliminary information; Simulink; Modulation","Al-Nuaimy, W., Zhang, J., Noble, A., Web-Based Learning Environment for a Communications Module (2001) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 9 (2), pp. 114-121. , DOI 10.1002/cae.1013; Kozick, R.J., Crane, C.C., An integrated environment for modeling, simulation, digital signal processing, and control (1996) IEEE Transactions on Education, 39 (2), pp. 114-119. , PII S0018935996042628; Yoder, M.A., Black, B.A., Teaching DSP fi rst with LabVIEW (2006) Proc. 4th IEEE Signal Processing Education Workshop, pp. 278-280. , Teton National Park, WY 2006 (IEEE, Piscataway, NJ; Ahamed, F., Scarpino, F.A., An educational digital communications project using FPGAs to implement a BPSK detector (2005) IEEE Transactions on Education, 48 (1), pp. 191-197. , DOI 10.1109/TE.2004.837036; Ruggieri, M., A digital signal processing course for communication systems applications (1996) IEEE Transactions on Education, 39 (2), pp. 153-157. , PII S0018935996045906; Chenard, J.S., Zilic, Z., Prokic, M., A laboratory setup and teaching methodology for wireless and mobile embedded systems (2008) IEEE Trans.

The technical architecture provides mechanisms for assigning different content or materials to students and then guiding them to form groups with other students in which the combination and integration of their content satisfies some pre-assigned critera or goal. The uniqueness of this lies in the dynamic forming of collaborative groups rather than having fixed or preassigned groupings of students for doing collaborative work. We present the theoretical underpinnings of our approach, the initial design of the software and the iterative cycles of a Design-based Research (DBR) approach that tries out the continuously being-refined design with primary school students. Feedback and data collected from observing students' actual learning behaviors and motivations in the cycles were used to propose a new cycle of the system and user-interface redesign. Such school-based trials provided demonstrations of the platform in supporting two content-specific learning applications, namely in mathematics and Chinese language learning activities in a primary school setting. They show the enactment of collaborative scaffolding comprising peer, technological and teacher scaffolding in supporting the students' formation of groups, and their collaboration and learning. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL); Design-based research (DBR); Mobile learning; Mobile mathematics learning; Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL); Software architectures","Design; Scaffolds; Software architecture; Students; Teaching; User interfaces; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; DBR; Mathematics learning; Mobile Learning; Mobileassisted language learning (MALL); Engineering education","Nussbaum, M., Technology as small group face-to-face collaborative scaffolding (2009) Computers and Education, 52, pp. 147-153; Sharples, M., Disruptive devices: Mobile technology for conversational learning (2003) Int'l J.

The lack of research in online technology field in developing countries strongly limits the development of online technology infrastructure and the use of online technology at many levels: individuals, groups, organisations, and regions. This study seeks to investigate the concerns of 327 Turkish higher education faculty members regarding adoption of social media in their instruction and the faculty development opportunities to resolve their concerns. Two different data collection methods were utilised to collect data from the participants. The survey contained three parts: a faculty demographics section b stages of concern questionnaire c professional development needs survey. Qualitative data obtained from the structured levels of use interviews. Results of the study indicated that the instructors were concerned about not having enough support and not knowing enough about social media use in instruction. Faculty members with less experience had higher self-concerns than their peers with more social media experience. Results of interviews supported the higher rate of self-concerns. Of the 12 faculty development and support activities analysed, technology support and incentives were perceived as the most effective ones.

The most important initiative is that of introducing sustainable development as a basic transversal skill for each thematic unit of the class, thereby completely modifying the content. To achieve this adaptation, a methodology is developed that can be systematically followed in any class. This article includes an example of how this methodology was implemented in an ""Industrial Construction and Industrial Services"" class, which is part of the industrial engineering major at a Spanish university. The objectives and results achieved in the class demonstrate the benefits of using the proposed method to incorporate an adequate amount of SDE into university degree programs. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction; Engineering education; Engineering profession; Sustainable development","Construction; Planning; Professional aspects; Sustainable development; Education for sustainable development; Engineering profession; Industrial construction; Industrial services; Thematic units; Transversal skills; University degree; Engineering education","Amadei, B., Sandekian, R., Model of integrating humanitarian development into engineering education (2010) J.

Such technical challenges cross disciplinary and institutional boundaries and often involve matters beyond the realm of technics. In this essay the authors argue that broad training in the social and environmental dimensions of new technologies in the engineering disciplines is essential to a rapid and successful renewable energy transition. The technical complexities of the renewable energy challenge will require more technical expertise. The development of renewable energy technologies in most countries, including the United States, has been fraught with uncertainties and contradictions. Yet people are told there is a consensus between political parties and the scientific-engineering community toward a worldwide renewable energy transition.",,"Cross-disciplinary; Engineering disciplines; Political parties; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Technical challenges; Technical complexity; Technical expertise; Civil engineering; Engineering education","Abraham, M.A., Nguyen, N., Green engineering: Defining the principles - Results from the Sandestin conference (2003) Environ.
